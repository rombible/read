The truth seems to be that from a religious hymn of Israel, since religion and patriotism were one, the expression of the national feeling against heathen oppressors and apostates who sided with them could not well be absent, whatever its immediate subject and tone. But the poet touches even a profounder truth.<span class= "note">[19]</span> The harmony of creation was soon broken by sin, and the harmony of the song of creation would hardly be complete, or rather, would be false and unreal, did not a discord make itself heard. The form such a suggestion would take was conditioned by the nationality of the poet; the spirit of it brings this ancient hymn at its close into accord with the feeling of modern literature, as reflected in Wordsworth’s well-known “Verses Written in Early Spring”:—<p><span class= "note">[19] In reality the power of sin to interfere with God’s pleasure. in His universe is present as an undercurrent of thought in Psalms 103, as well as 104. In the former it is implied that forgiveness and restoration are requisite before the harmony of the universe (</span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/104-20.htm" title="You make darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.">Psalm 104:20-22</a><span class= "note">) can become audible.

And if mediation on the glories of creation be so sweet to the soul, what greater glory appears to the enlightened mind, when contemplating the great work of redemption!

This might with propriety be rendered, "Consumed are the sinners out of the earth," expressing a fact and not a desire; and it may have been prompted by the feeling of the psalmist that such an event would occur; that is, that the time would come when sin would no more abound, but when the world would be filled with righteousness, and all the dwellers on the earth would praise God. The word translated "consumed" - from &#1514;&#1502;&#1501;  ta&#770;mam - means properly to complete, to perfect, to finish, to cease. It does not mean "consume" in the sense of being burned up - as our word means - or destroyed, but merely to come to an end, to cease, to pass away: that is; Let the time soon come - or, the time will soon come - when there will be no sinners on the earth, but when all the inhabitants of the earth will worship and honor God. The "connection" here seems to be this: The psalmist was himself so filled with the love of God, and with admiration of his works, that he desired that all might partake of the same feeling; and he looked forward, therefore, as those who love God must do, to the time when all the dwellers on earth would see his glory, and when there should be none who did not adore and love him. All that is "fairly" implied in the wish of the psalmist here would be accomplished if all sinners were converted, and if, in that sense, there were to be no more transgressors in the world.<p>And let the wicked be no more - Let there not be anymore wicked persons; let the time come when there shall be no bad people on the earth, but when all shall be righteous. In this prayer all persons could properly unite.<p>Bless thou the Lord, O my soul - The psalm closes (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a> does) as it began. The psalmist commenced with the expression of a purpose to bless God; it closes with the same purpose, confirmed by a survey of the wonderful works of God.<p>Praise ye the Lord - Hebrew, Hallelu-jah. The psalmist expresses the earnest desire of a truly pious heart (in looking upon a world so beautiful, so varied in its works, so full of the expressions of the wisdom and goodness of God - a world where all the inferior creation so completely carries out the purpose of the Creator), that man, the noblest of all the works of God, might unite with the world around and beneath him in carrying out the great purpose of the creation - so that he might, in his own proper place, and according to the powers with which he is endowed, acknowledge God. How beautiful - how sublime - would be the spectacle on earth, if man accomplished the purpose of his creation, and filled his place, as well as the springs, the hills, the trees, the fowls, the wild goats, the moon, the sun, the young lions, and the inhabitants of the "great and wide sea" do in their spheres! Oh, come the time when on earth there shall be harmony in all the works of God, and when all creatures here shall carry out the purpose which was contemplated when God called the earth into existence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35.

Not in common, for all men are sinners, even good men are not without sin; but notorious sinners, whose lives are one continued series and course of sinning; such as will not have Christ to reign over them, and do not give him the glory due unto him; particularly antichrist, the man of sin, and his followers; they that worship the beast and his image: these will be consumed with the breath of his mouth, and with the brightness of his coming, and will perish out of his land, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>. <p>And let the wicked be no more; as the wicked one, antichrist, will be no more when consumed; there will never rise another, when the beast and false prophet are taken and cast alive into the lake of fire; there will no more of the antichristian party remain, the remnant of them will be slain with the sword; after the battle of Armageddon, there will be none left of the followers of antichrist, nor any ever rise up any more. <p>Bless thou the Lord, O my soul; as for his mercies, spiritual and temporal, so for the destruction of all his enemies. The psalm begins and ends alike as the preceding. <p>Praise ye the Lord, or hallelujah: this is the first time this word is used in this book of Psalms, though frequently afterwards: and it is observable that it is only used, in the New Testament, at the prophecy of the destruction of antichrist, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a> which may serve to confirm the sense before given; and is to be considered as a call upon the saints to praise the Lord, on account of his righteous judgments on his and his church's enemies; so Aben Ezra. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let the sinners be <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.

It is not an imprecation, but a solemn prayer for the restoration of the harmony of creation by the banishment from it of “all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity.” The preceding verses (31, 32) have just hinted that there is something in the world which may hinder God from continuing to rejoice in His works. What is it?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Disproportioned sin<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jarred against nature’s chime, and with harsh din<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Broke the fair music that all creatures made<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To their great Lord, whose love their motion swayed<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In perfect diapason, whilst they stood<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In first obedience, and their state of good.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Modern thought would say, ‘May sin be banished’: but Hebrew thought is not abstract but concrete, and moreover the form of the prayer reminds us of the solemn truth that sin is a personal thing, which cannot be separated from the sinner, but has its existence through his perverted will. It may be noted that the intensive form of the word for sinner implies obstinate and incorrigible habit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As in Psalms 103, the Psalmist concludes as he began, <span class="ital">Bless Jehovah, O my soul</span>, to which is appended the general call to praise, <span class="ital">Hallelujah</span>, ‘Praise ye Jah.’ This word (for according to the Massoretic tradition it is to be written as one word except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-3.htm" title="Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises to his name; for it is pleasant.">Psalm 135:3</a>) occurs nowhere but in the Psalter[57] and meets us here for the first time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-13.htm" title="Sing to the LORD, praise you the LORD: for he has delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.">Jeremiah 20:13</a> the phrase is ‘Praise ye Jehovah,’ as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm" title="O praise the LORD, all you nations: praise him, all you people.">Psalm 117:1</a>. Cp. however <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/13-18.htm" title="And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shall praise him, saying, Blessed be God, which hath extolled it for ever.">Tob 13:18</a>, “All her streets shall say, Hallelujah”: 3Ma 7:13, “The priests and all the people shouted, Hallelujah.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to Graetz (<span class="ital">Comm.</span> p. 91), and Ginsburg (<span class="ital">Introd. to the Heb. Bible</span>, pp. 376 ff.), it was the summons addressed by the precentor to the congregation to join him in reciting the Psalm, or to respond by repeating the first verse after his recitation of each verse. Its proper place therefore is at the beginning not at the end of a Psalm, and in the LXX (with the possible exception of Psalms 150) it is always found at the beginning. In the Massoretic text however it occurs at both beginning and end of eight Psalms, at the beginning only of two, at the end only of five, and once in the text of the Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-3.htm" title="Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises to his name; for it is pleasant.">Psalm 135:3</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Let the great blot upon creation - sin and sinners - exist no more.
