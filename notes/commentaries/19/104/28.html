And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for the twilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create our souls to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/104.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That thou givest them they gather - What thou dost place before them they collect. They have no resources of their own. They can invent nothing; they cannot vary their food by art, as man does; they cannot make use of reason, as man does, or of skill, in preparing it, to suit and pamper the appetite. It comes prepared for them direct from the hand of God.<p>Thou openest thine hand - As one does who bestows a gift on another. The point in the passage is, that they receive it immediately from God, and that they are wholly dependent on him for it. They have not to labor to prepare it, but it is made ready for them, and they have only to gather it up. The allusion in the "language" may be to the gathering of manna in the wilderness, when it was provided by God, and people had only to collect it for their use. So it is with the brute creation on land and in the waters.<p>They are filled with good - They are "satiated" with good; that is, They are satisfied with what to them is good, or with what supplies their needs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-30. The entire dependence of this immense family on God is set forth. With Him, to kill or make alive is equally easy. To hide His face is to withdraw favor (Ps 13:1). By His spirit, or breath, or mere word, He gives life. It is His constant providence which repairs the wastes of time and disease.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whatsoever they receive is from thy bounty and gift. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou openest thine hand; </span> thou providest plentifully for them; as this phrase implies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-1.htm" title="At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.">Deu 15:1</a></span>: compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-20.htm" title="She stretches out her hand to the poor; yes, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.">Proverbs 31:20</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/104.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That thou givest them they gather,.... What God bestows upon them as a bounty of Providence they take and make use of, and in their way thankfully, and without repining; some gather it up for immediate use and service, and not into barns; others gather it up for time to come, as the ant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>. Kimchi understands this of a time of scarcity, when they gather here a little and there a little; as he does the following clause of a time of plenty. <p>Thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good; God, in whose hand all things are, and from whence all things come, opens his hand of providence, and liberally and bountifully gives, as this phrase signifies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a> and all his creatures are filled with his good things to their satisfaction: and thus the spiritual food which he gives his people, they gather it by the hand of faith, as the Israelites gathered the manna in the wilderness every morning, and according to their eating, what was sufficient for them; and to whom he gives liberally, even all things richly to enjoy; all things pertaining to life and godliness; Christ, and all things along with him; abundance of grace here, and glory hereafter; and they are satisfied with his good things as with marrow and fatness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>.

The moon is mentioned first of all, because the poet wishes to make the picture of the day follow that of the night. He describes it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-19.htm">Psalm 104:19</a> as the calendarial principal star. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; are points and divisions of time (epochs), and the principal measurer of these for civil and ecclesiastical life is the moon (cf. Sir. 43:7, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;), just as the sun, knowing when he is to set, is the infallible measurer of the day. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-20.htm">Psalm 104:20</a> the description, which throughout is drawn in the presence of God in His honour, passes over into direct address: jussives (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;) stand in the hypothetical protasis and in its apodosis (EW. 357, b). It depends upon God's willing only, and it is night, and the wakeful life of the wild beasts begins to be astir. The young lions then roar after their prey, and flagitaturi sunt a Deo cibum suum. The infinitive with Lamed is an elliptical expression of a conjugatio periphrastica (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>), and becomes a varying expression of the future in general in the later language in approximation to the Aramaic. The roar of the lions and their going forth in quest of prey is an asking of God which He Himself has implanted in their nature. With the rising of the sun the aspect of things becomes very different. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; is feminine here, where the poet drops the personification (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-14</a>). The day which dawns with sunrise is the time for man. Both as to matter and style, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a> call to mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-5.htm">Job 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-8.htm">Job 37:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-40.htm">Job 38:40</a>. </body></html>
