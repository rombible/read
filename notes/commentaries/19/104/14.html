But some deny this meaning to the Hebrew, which properly means “labour” or “office.” (In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-26.htm" title="And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:">1Chronicles 27:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-37.htm" title="And that we should bring the first fruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground to the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.">Nehemiah 10:37</a>, it means “agriculture,” “tillage.”) Hence they render, “And herbs for man’s labour in bringing them forth from the earth,” alluding to his task of cultivating the soil. Standing by itself the clause would indeed naturally require this sense, but the parallelism is against it, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-30.htm" title="And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.">1Chronicles 26:30</a>, “service of a king,” we have a near approach to the meaning “use.”<p><span class= "bld">That he may.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">bringing food out of the earth, </span>taking the verb as gerund instead of infinitive absolute.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>104:10-18 When we reflect upon the provision made for all creatures, we should also notice the natural worship they render to God.

The idea here is not merely that of "abundance;" it is also that of "variety:" the needs and tastes of all have been consulted in the productions of the earth. The one earth - the same earth - has been made to produce the endless varieties of food required for the creatures that have been placed on it. The word "grass" here refers to all the vegetable productions needful for cattle.<p>And herb for the service of man - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>. The word "herb" here would include every green plant or vegetable; or all that the earth produces for the food of man. This, of course, refers to the earth as it came from the hand of God, and to the original arrangement, before permission was given to man to eat the flesh of animals, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>. The word translated "service" might be rendered "culture," as if man was to cultivate it for his use, not that it was to be produced, as the food for cattle, spontaneously.<p>That he may bring forth food out of the earth - Hebrew, "bread."

By means of rain falling upon the tender herb, and upon the mown grass, whereby provision of food is made for those creatures that live upon grass. <p>And herb for the service of man: some herbs being for physic for him, and others for food, and all more or less for his use. Herbs were the original food of man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a> and still a dinner of herbs, where love is, is better than a stalled ox, and hatred therewith, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-17.htm">Proverbs 15:17</a>. Some render it, "and herb at the tillage of man" (o): grass grows of itself for the use of the cattle; but the herb, as wheat and the like, which is for the use of man, is caused to grow when man has taken some pains with the earth, and has tilled and manured it: but the former sense seems best. <p>That he may bring forth food out of the earth; either that man may do it by his tillage; or rather that the Lord may do it, by sending rain, and causing the grass and herbs to grow. However, man's food, as well as the food of beasts, comes out of the earth, as he himself does, and to which he must return. <p>(o) "ad culturam", Cocceius, some in Vatablus, and Michaelis; so Gussetius, p. 572. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</span><p>(h) He describes God's providential care over man, who not only provides necessary things for him such as herbs and other meat: but also things to rejoice and comfort him such as wine and oil or ointments.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">herb</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-11.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: and it was so....">Genesis 1:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-29.htm" title="And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat....">Genesis 1:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-18.htm" title="Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;">Genesis 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-3.htm" title="Every moving thing that lives shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.">Genesis 9:3</a>.
