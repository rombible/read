(1) The separation of the land and water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/104-5.htm" title="Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.">Psalm 104:5-9</a>); (2) the clothing of the earth with grass, herbs, and trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/104-10.htm" title="He sends the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.">Psalm 104:10-18</a>). The poet, however, ranges beyond the Mosaic account, and already peoples the earth with the living creatures of the fifth day. “It is not a picture of still life like that of Genesis, but a living, moving, animated scene” (Perowne).<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Who laid . . .</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">He fixed the earth on its foundations. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/38-4.htm" title="Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if you have understanding.">Job 38:4-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-29.htm" title="When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:">Proverbs 8:29</a>.)<p>The inconsistency of this with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-7.htm" title="He stretches out the north over the empty place, and hangs the earth on nothing.">Job 26:7</a>, “He laid the earth upon nothing,” need not cause difficulty.

The margin is, "He hath founded the earth upon her bases." The Hebrew word rendered in the margin "her bases" means properly a place; then a basis or foundation. The idea is, that there wes something, as it were, placed under the earth to support it. The idea is not uncommon in the Scriptures. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>.<p>That it should not be removed for ever - So that it cannot be shaken out of its place. That is, It is fixed, permanent, solid. Its foundations do not give way, as edifices reared by man. but it abides the same from age to age - the most fixed and stable object of which we have any knowledge.

With this thought the poet draws on to the close of his song of praise. The heavens in opposition to the earth, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>, is the unchangeable realm above the rise and fall of things here below. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; refers to everything created without exception, the universe of created things. In connection with the heavens of glory the poet cannot but call to mind the angels. His call to these to join in the praise of Jahve has its parallel only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1-11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1-14</a>. It arises from the consciousness of the church on earth that it stands in living like-minded fellowship with the angels of God, and that it possesses a dignity which rises above all created things, even the angels which are appointed to serve it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>). They are called &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>, and in fact &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;, as the strong to whom belongs strength unequalled. Their life endowed with heroic strength is spent entirely - an example for mortals - in an obedient execution of the word of God. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is a definition not of the purpose, but of the manner: obediendo (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> perficiendo). Hearing the call of His word, they also forthwith put it into execution. the hosts (&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;), as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; shows, are the celestial spirits gathered around the angels of a higher rank (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>), the innumerable &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), for there is a hierarchia caelestis. From the archangels the poet comes to the myriads of the heavenly hosts, and from these to all creatures, that they, wheresoever they may be throughout Jahve's wide domain, may join in the song of praise that is to be struck up; and from this point he comes back to his own soul, which he modestly includes among the creatures mentioned in the third passage. A threefold &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; now corresponds to the threefold &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;; and inasmuch as the poet thus comes back to his own soul, his Psalm also turns back into itself and assumes the form of a converging circle. </body></html>
