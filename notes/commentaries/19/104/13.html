But still, it was a fact that the hills themselves were watered; that there were springs far up their heights; and that vegetation was sustained above the reach of the fountains and streams below; and it was a proof of the divine skill and beneficence that, in some way, water was furnished on the summits and sides of the hills themselves. This was caused, the psalmist says, by God's pouring water on them, as it were, from his own "chambers" - his abode on high. The allusion is, doubtless, to rain, which seems to be poured down from the very abode of God. The word rendered "chambers" means "upper rooms," (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>); and the reference is to the dwelling-place of God, as far above the earth.<p>The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works - Thy doings; with what thou hast done. All the needs of the earth seem to be met and "satisfied;" all that it could desire to make it fertile and beautiful; and the proper abode of man, of beast, and of fowl, has been granted. It has no cause of complaint; nothing has been left undone, in the valleys or on the hills, on the dry land or in the waters, that was needful to be done to carry out the purpose for which it has been called into being. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13.

The house of his superior treasures, as the Targum. The airy regions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> with the clouds of heaven, by the rain which they drop down upon them; the usefulness of which blessings of nature is largely described in this and some following verses. "The hills", which are naturally dry and barren, and receive but little advantage from the springs, fountains, and rivers below, are supplied with water from above; and become fruitful, bear herbage, and are clothed with flocks. This seems to refer to the first rain that was upon the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-5.htm">Genesis 2:5</a> and which favour is continued to all lands, excepting some part of the land of Egypt, and in all ages since; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>. So ministers of the word, who are set in the first place, and are eminent in the church of God, and who water others, are watered themselves with the gifts and graces of the Spirit descending from above, as the apostles were, in an extraordinary manner, at the day of Pentecost; and as others in a more ordinary manner daily are. So likewise the churches of Christ, comparable to hills and mountains for firmness and visibility, and the several members thereof, are watered with the dews of divine favour, with the rain of the divine word; which comes down from heaven as the rain does, and drops and distils like that; and with the grace of the divine Spirit, whereby their souls become as a watered garden, whose springs fail not. <p>The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works; with the fruits which grow out of it by means of rain, as are after mentioned; herbs, grass, and trees, so Aben Ezra: or with the influences of the heavens, which are the work of God's hands, and by which the earth is made fruitful; or more particularly with the virtue and efficacy of the rain, so Kimchi; which is the Lord's peculiar work, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>. This the earth drinking in, is as satisfied with as a thirsty man is with drinking a draught of water; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:11</a>. So the people of God, comparable to the good earth that drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, are satisfied with the love of God, with the blessings of his grace, with the doctrines of his Gospel, and with the ordinances of his house. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He watereth the hills from his <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</span><p>(g) From the clouds.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. Who giveth the mountains drink from his upper chambers. Palestine was “a land of mountains and valleys, drinking water of the rain of heaven” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-11.htm" title="But the land, where you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven:">Deuteronomy 11:11</a>).

But this is harsh: it is much more natural to take the phrase in the simple sense of “fruit produced by God’s manifold operations.” Earth is fertilised by the rain and springs, and rejoices in its abundant produce. The thought is further developed in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/104-14.htm" title="He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;...">Psalm 104:14-18</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) <span class="cmt_word">watereth the hills from his chambers</span> (comp. ver. 3).

The suffix, referring back to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, is intended to say that the earth hanging free in space (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>) has its internal supports. Its eternal stability is preserved even amidst the judgment predicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>., since it comes forth out of it, unremoved from its former station, as a transformed, glorified earth. The deep (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;) with which God covers it is that primordial mass of water in which it lay first of all as it were in embryo, for it came into being &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; does not refer to &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; (masc. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-14.htm">Job 28:14</a>), because then &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; would be required, but to &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, and the masculine is to be explained either by attraction) according to the model of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>), or by a reversion to the masculine ground-form as the discourse proceeds (cf. the same thing with &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-13.htm">2 Samuel 17:13</a>, &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-6.htm">Exodus 11:6</a>, &#1497;&#1491; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a>, the earth thus overflowed with water was already mountainous; the primal formation of the mountains is therefore just as old as the &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; mentioned in direct succession to the &#1514;&#1492;&#1493; &#1493;&#1489;&#1492;&#1493;. After this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a> describe the subduing of the primordial waters by raising up the dry land and the confining of these waters in basins surrounded by banks. Terrified by the despotic command of God, they started asunder, and mountains rose aloft, the dry land with its heights and its low grounds appeared. The rendering that the waters, thrown into wild excitement, rose up the mountains and descended again (Hengstenberg), does not harmonize with the fact that they are represented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a> as standing above the mountains. Accordingly, too, it is not to be interpreted after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a> : they (the waters) rose mountain-high, they sunk down like valleys. The reference of the description to the coming forth of the dry land on the third day of creation requires that &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; should be taken as subject to &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;. But then, too, the &#1489;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; are the subject to &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, as Hilary of Poictiers renders it in his Genesis, 5:97, etc.: subsidunt valles, and not the waters as subsiding into the valleys. Hupfeld is correct; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a> is a parenthesis which affirms that, inasmuch as the waters retreating laid the solid land bare, mountains and valleys as such came forth visibly; cf. Ovid, Metam. i.:344: Flumina subsidunt, montes exire videntur. </body></html>
