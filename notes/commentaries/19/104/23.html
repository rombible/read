And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for the twilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenous creatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language of grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings which cannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he must continue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works of God. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the more rough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designed to serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a new world rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alone lives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soul enters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to glory or to misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create our souls to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/104.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Man goeth forth ... - Man is now seen to go forth from his dwelling, and he appears on the stage to perform his daily toil, until evening comes, and then again he gives way for the beasts of night. Thus the scene is ever varying - showing how full of animated existence the earth is; how varied are the occupations of its different inhabitants; and how the varieties of being are adapted to its own varied condition in the alternations of day and night. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-23.

Having taken sleep in the night, being comfortably refreshed, and his strength recruited; he rises with the rising sun, and goes forth cheerfully and with intrepidity to his work in the field, or elsewhere, the beasts being fled and gone. <p>And to his labour until the evening; to till the ground, and do other services and labour, either of the head or hand; for man is born and designed for labour, and not for sloth and idleness: in his innocent state he was set to dress the garden and keep it; and, after the fall, his doom was to get his bread by the sweat of his brow; and he is to work while the day lasts, till the evening and night come on, when he betakes himself to sleep and rest again. So the believer, though the work of redemption and salvation is wrought for him, and the work of grace is wrought in him, each by another hand; yet he has work enough to do, which he is created for, and under obligation to perform; and in which he is to continue steadfast and immovable, while the day of life lasts, till the night of death comes, and no man can work; and then he rests from his labours, and his works follow him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{m}</span> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</span><p>(m) That is, when the day springs for the light is as it were a shield to defend man against the tyranny and fierceness of beasts.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/104.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the fourth decastich the poet goes further among the creatures of the field and of the forest. The subject to &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; is &#1502;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1495;. The clause expressing the purpose, which twice begins with an infinitive, is continued in both instances, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, but with a change of subject (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4</a>), in the finite verb. On what is said of wine we may compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>, Sir. 40:20, and more especially Isaiah, who frequently mentions wine as a representative of all the natural sources of joy. The assertion that &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; signifies "before oil  equals  brighter than oil," is an error that is rightly combated by Bttcher in his Proben and two of his "Gleanings," <p>(Note: Proben, i.e., Specimens of Old Testament interpretation, Leipzig 1833, and Aehrenlese (Gleanings), referred to in the preface of these volumes. - Tr.)<p>which imputes to the poet a mention of oil that is contrary to his purpose in this connection wand inappropriate. Corn, wine, and oil are mentioned as the three chief products of the vegetable kingdom (Luther, Calvin, Grotius, Dathe, and Hupfeld), and are assumed under &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>, as is also the case in other instances where distinction would be superfluous, e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22</a>. With oil God makes the countenance shining, or bright and cheerful, not by means of anointing-since it was not the face but the head that was anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17</a>), - but by the fact of its increasing the savouriness and nutritiveness of the food. &#1500;&#1492;&#1510;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500; is chosen with reference to &#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1512;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; does not stand after, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> (where it is &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1470; with Gaja on account of the distinctive), but before the verb, because &#1500;&#1489;&#1489; as that which is inward stands in antithesis to &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as that which is outside. Since the fertilization of the earth by the rain is the chief subject of the predication in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-16.htm">Psalm 104:16</a> is naturally attached to what precedes without arousing critical suspicion. That which satisfies is here the rain itself, and not, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>, that which the rain matures. The "trees of Jahve" are those which before all others proclaim the greatness of their Creator. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; refers to these trees, of which the cedars and then the cypresses (&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, root &#1489;&#1512;, to cut) are mentioned. They are places where small and large birds build their nests and lodge, more particularly the stork, which is called the &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; as being &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (Barbrius, Fab. xiii.), as avis pia (pietaticultrix in Petronius, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6</a>), i.e., on account of its love of family life, on account of which it is also regarded as bringing good fortune to a house.<p>(Note: In the Merg&amp; district, where the stork is not called leklek as it is elsewhere, but charnuk[ on account of its bill like a long horn (Arab. chrn) standing out in front, the women and children call it Arab. 'bu&#770; sa&#8219;d, "bringer of good luck." Like the &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, the long-legged carrion-vulture (Vultur percnopterus) or mountain-stork, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, is called &#1512;&#1495;&#1501; (Arab. rh&#803;m) on account of its &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;.)<p>The care of God for the lodging of His creatures leads the poet from the trees to the heights of the mountains and the hiding-places of the rocks, in a manner that is certainly abrupt and that disturbs the sketch taken from the account of the creation. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; is an apposition. &#1497;&#1506;&#1500; (Arabic wa&#8219;il) is the steinboc, wild-goat, as being an inhabitant of &#1497;&#1506;&#1500; (wa&#8219;l, wa&#8219;la), i.e., the high places of the rocks, as &#1497;&#1506;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>, according to Wetzstein, is the ostrich as being an inhabitant of the wa&#8219;na, i.e., the sterile desert; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1503; is the rock-badger, which dwells in the clefts of the rocks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-26.htm">Proverbs 30:26</a>), and resembles the marmot - South Arabic Arab. tufun, Hyrax Syriacus (distinct from the African). By &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1503; the Jewish tradition understand the coney, after which the Peshto here renders it &#1500;&#1495;&#1490;&#1505;&#1488; (&#1495;&#1490;&#1505;, cuniculus). Both animals, the coney and the rock-badger, may be meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-5.htm">Leviticus 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-7.htm">Deuteronomy 14:7</a>; for the sign of the cloven hoof (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;) is wanting in both. The coney has four toes, and the hyrax has a peculiar formation of hoof, not cloven, but divided into several parts. </body></html>
