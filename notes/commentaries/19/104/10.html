But a poet, especially an Oriental poet, thinks first of the springs and rivers on which fertility and life depend. And such is his sympathy with nature that in disregard of the original record he hastens at once to people his world with creatures to share the Creator’s joy in its beauty and goodness.<p><span class= "bld">Valleys</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the torrent beds, the “wadys” as the Arabs now call them.<p><span class= "bld">Which run.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">they flow between the hills. </span>The LXX. supply the subject “waters.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/104.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/104-10.htm" title="He sends the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills....">Psalm 104:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">He sendeth the springs — </span>“The waters of the sea are not only prevented from destroying the earth, but, by a wonderful machinery, are rendered the means of preserving every living thing which moveth thereon. Partly ascending from the great deep, through the strata of the earth, partly exhaled in vapour, from the surface of the ocean, into the air, and from thence falling in rain, especially on the tops and by the sides of the mountains, they break forth in fresh springs, having left their salts behind them; they trickle through the valleys, between the hills, receiving new supplies as they go; they become large rivers, and, after watering, by their innumerable turnings and windings, immense tracts of country, they return to the place from whence they came.” — Horne.

He has made provision for watering it, and by a most wise, wonderful, and benevolent arrangement, he has formed springs among the valleys and the hills. It is now animated nature which comes before the eye of the psalmist; and all this he traces to the fact that the earth is "watered," and that it is not a waste of rocks and sands. The allusion in this part of the psalm (see the Introduction) is to the earth as covered with vegetation - or, to the third day of the week of creation <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-13</a>, which, in Genesis, is connected with the gathering of the waters into seas. This description continues in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-18.htm">Psalm 104:18</a>. The literal rendering here would be, "sending springs into the valleys." He conducts the waters from the great reservoirs - lakes and seas - in such a way that they form springs in the valleys. The way in which this is done is among the most wonderful and the most benevolent in nature - by that power, derived from heat, by which the waters of the ocean, contrary to the natural law of gravitation, are lifted up in small particles - in vapor - and carried by the clouds where they are needed, and let fall upon the earth, to water the plants, and to form fountains, rivulets, and streams - and borne thus to the highest mountains, to be filtered through the ground to form springs and streams below.<p>Which run among the hills - Margin, "walk." That is, they go between the hills. The streams of water flow along in the natural valleys which have been made for them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/104.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13. Once destructive, these waters are subjected to the service of God's creatures.

The Targum is, <p>"who sendeth fountains into the rivers.'' <p>Either from the waters of the sea, which being drained through the sand, become sweet and drinkable; or from the hills and mountains. This is an instance of divine goodness, that having removed the waters from the earth, and shut them up in the sea, and which, through the saltness of them, not being proper drink for men and beasts, he has been pleased to form and open springs, fountains, wells, and rivers of fresh water in the valleys, for the supply of both. Though this is not to be compared with the wells of salvation, and springs and fountains of grace, which he has opened for his chosen people. God himself is a spring or fountain of living water; his love is a river, whose streams delight the city of God; his covenant a source and spring of all blessings and promises. Christ is the fountain of gardens; his fulness is a supply for all his people: the Spirit of God and his grace are a well of living water, springing up unto eternal life. The word and ordinances are the springs in Zion, <p>which run among the hills, the several congregated churches, to the watering and refreshing of them; just as springs and rivers of water run in the dales and valleys among the hills, by which they are bounded. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

For inasmuch as God began the work of creation with the creation of light, He has covered Himself with this created light itself as with a garment. That which once happened in connection with the creation may, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>, and frequently, be expressed by participles of the present, because the original setting is continued in the preservation of the world; and determinate participles alternate with participles without the article, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24-28</a>, with no other difference than that the former are more predicative and the latter more attributive. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a> the poet comes upon the work of the second day: the creation of the expanse (&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;) which divides between the waters. God has spread this out (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>) like a tent-cloth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>), of such light and of such fine transparent work; &#1504;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492; here rhymes with &#1506;&#1496;&#1492;. In those waters which the "expanse" holds aloft over the earth God lays the beams of His upper chambers (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514;&#1493;, instead of which we find &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>, from &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, ascent, elevation, then an upper story, an upper chamber, which would be more accurately &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; after the Aramaic and Arabic); but not as though the waters were the material for them, they are only the place for them, that is exalted above the earth, and are able to be this because to the Immaterial One even that which is fluid is solid, and that which is dense is transparent. The reservoirs of the upper waters, the clouds, God makes, as the lightning, thunder, and rain indicate, into His chariot (&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;), upon which he rides along in order to make His power felt below upon the earth judicially (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>), or in rescuing and blessing men. &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; (only here) accords in sound with &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> also recalls this primary passage, where the wings of the wind take the place of the cloud-chariot. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a> the lxx (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>) makes the first substantive into an accusative of the object, and the second into an accusative of the predicate: &#x39f;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;. It is usually translated the reverse say: making the winds into His angels, etc. This rendering is possible so far as the language is concerned (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> Chethb, and on the position of the worlds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>), and the plural &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; is explicable in connection with this rendering from the force of the parallelism, and the singular &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; from the fact that this word has no plural. Since, however, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; with two accusatives usually signifies to produce something out of something, so that the second accusative (viz., the accusative of the predicate, which is logically the second, but according to the position of the words may just as well be the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-39.htm">Exodus 25:39</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>, as the second, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-23.htm">Exodus 37:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-18.htm">2 Chronicles 4:18-22</a>) denotes the materia ex qua, it may with equal right at least be interpreted: Who makes His messengers out of the winds, His servants out of the flaming or consuming (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>) fire (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>, masc.). And this may affirm either that God makes use of wind and fire for special missions (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>), or (cf. Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. 325f.) that He gives wind and fire to His angels for the purpose of His operations in the world which are effected through their agency, as the materials of their outward manifestation, and as it were of their self-embodiment, <p>(Note: It is a Talmudic view that God really makes the angels out of fire, B. Chagiga, 14a (cf. Koran, xxxviii. 77): Day by day are the angels of the service created out of the stream of fire (&#1504;&#1492;&#1512; &#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;), and sing their song of praise and perish.)<p>as then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a> wind and cherub are both to be associated together in thought as the vehicle of the divine activity in the world, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> the angel of Jahve represents the energy of the wind. </body></html>
