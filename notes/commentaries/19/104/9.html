The sea was an object of dread. Or if dread passes into reverent wonder, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/104-25.htm" title="So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.">Psalm 104:25-26</a>, it ends there; the Jew never took <span class= "ital">delight </span>in the sea. Hence, the coast has for him only one purpose and suggestion. It is not for enjoyment or recreation, or even for uses of commerce. It is simply the defence set by God against the hostile waters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/104.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-9.htm" title="You have set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.">Psalm 104:9</a>. </span><span class="ital">Thou hast set a bound — </span>Even the sand of the sea-shore, as is expressed <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm" title="Fear you not me? said the LORD: will you not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?">Jeremiah 5:22</a>. Which, though in itself contemptible, and a very poor defence to the earth against that swelling and raging element, yet, by God’s almighty power and gracious providence, is made sufficient for that purpose, as the experience of five thousand years hath taught us. <span class="ital">That they turn not again to cover the earth — </span>Once indeed they did, namely, in Noah’s flood, because God commanded them so to do; but not since, because he prohibits them, having promised not to drown the world again.

These verses rather describe the wonders of the flood than the creation (Ge 7:19, 20; 2Pe 3:5, 6). God's method of arresting the flood and making its waters subside is poetically called a "rebuke" (Ps 76:6; Isa 50:2), and the process of the flood's subsiding by undulations among the hills and valleys is vividly described.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/104.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A bound; </span> even the sand of the sea-shore, as it is expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm" title="Fear you not me? said the LORD: will you not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?">Jeremiah 5:22</a></span>, which, though in itself contemptible, and a very poor defence to the earth against that swelling and raging element, yet by God’s almighty power and gracious providence is made sufficient for that purpose; which is noted as a wonderful work of God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-8.htm" title="Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?">Job 38:8</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The earth, </span> to wit, the whole earth, as it did in the beginning of the creation. This was God’s appointment, and the course of nature settled by him. But when men transgressed their bounds, all the laws of God and men, it is not strange if the waters also transgressed their bounds, and once again overwhelmed the earth in the general deluge. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/104.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou hast set a bound, that they may not pass over,.... The Targum adds, <p>"to the rolling waves of the sea.'' <p>Set doors with bolts and bars, cliffs, rocks, and shores: and, what is more surprising, sand, which is penetrable, flexible, and moveable, is set as a perpetual bound to the raging ocean and its waves, which they cannot pass over: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8</a>. So the Lord has set a bound to the proud waters of afflictions, and says, Thus far shall ye go, and no farther; and to the life of man, which he cannot exceed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>. But he has given man a law, as a rule to walk by, as the boundary of his conversation, and this he transgresses; in which he is less tractable than the raging sea and its waves. That they turn not again to cover the earth; as they did when it was first made, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a> that is, not without the divine leave and power; for they did turn again and cover the earth, at the time of the flood; but never shall more. Some think there is no need to make this exception; since this was written after the flood, and when God had swore that the waters should no more go over the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-9.htm">Isaiah 54:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/104.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/104.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>.

The Deluge is for the time beyond the ken of the poet, who is singing God's  greatness <span class="accented">in nature</span>, and in the <span class="accented">general</span> laws under which he has placed it. <span class="cmt_word">Neither turn again to cover the earth.</span> This law, once Broken by the miracle of the Deluge, was thenceforth made absolute and inviolable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-15.htm">Genesis 9:15</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/104.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first decastich begins the celebration with work of the first and second days. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512; here is not the doxa belonging to God &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Jde 1:25), but the doxa which He has put on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-10.htm">Job 40:10</a>) since He created the world, over against which He stands in kingly glory, or rather in which He is immanent, and which reflects this kingly glory in various gradations, yea, to a certain extent is this glory itself. For inasmuch as God began the work of creation with the creation of light, He has covered Himself with this created light itself as with a garment. That which once happened in connection with the creation may, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>, and frequently, be expressed by participles of the present, because the original setting is continued in the preservation of the world; and determinate participles alternate with participles without the article, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24-28</a>, with no other difference than that the former are more predicative and the latter more attributive. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a> the poet comes upon the work of the second day: the creation of the expanse (&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;) which divides between the waters. God has spread this out (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>) like a tent-cloth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>), of such light and of such fine transparent work; &#1504;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492; here rhymes with &#1506;&#1496;&#1492;. In those waters which the "expanse" holds aloft over the earth God lays the beams of His upper chambers (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514;&#1493;, instead of which we find &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>, from &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, ascent, elevation, then an upper story, an upper chamber, which would be more accurately &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; after the Aramaic and Arabic); but not as though the waters were the material for them, they are only the place for them, that is exalted above the earth, and are able to be this because to the Immaterial One even that which is fluid is solid, and that which is dense is transparent. The reservoirs of the upper waters, the clouds, God makes, as the lightning, thunder, and rain indicate, into His chariot (&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;), upon which he rides along in order to make His power felt below upon the earth judicially (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>), or in rescuing and blessing men. &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; (only here) accords in sound with &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> also recalls this primary passage, where the wings of the wind take the place of the cloud-chariot. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a> the lxx (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>) makes the first substantive into an accusative of the object, and the second into an accusative of the predicate: &#x39f;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;. It is usually translated the reverse say: making the winds into His angels, etc. This rendering is possible so far as the language is concerned (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> Chethb, and on the position of the worlds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>), and the plural &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; is explicable in connection with this rendering from the force of the parallelism, and the singular &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; from the fact that this word has no plural. Since, however, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; with two accusatives usually signifies to produce something out of something, so that the second accusative (viz., the accusative of the predicate, which is logically the second, but according to the position of the words may just as well be the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-39.htm">Exodus 25:39</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>, as the second, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-23.htm">Exodus 37:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-18.htm">2 Chronicles 4:18-22</a>) denotes the materia ex qua, it may with equal right at least be interpreted: Who makes His messengers out of the winds, His servants out of the flaming or consuming (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>) fire (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>, masc.). And this may affirm either that God makes use of wind and fire for special missions (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>), or (cf. Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, i. 325f.) that He gives wind and fire to His angels for the purpose of His operations in the world which are effected through their agency, as the materials of their outward manifestation, and as it were of their self-embodiment, <p>(Note: It is a Talmudic view that God really makes the angels out of fire, B. Chagiga, 14a (cf. Koran, xxxviii. 77): Day by day are the angels of the service created out of the stream of fire (&#1504;&#1492;&#1512; &#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;), and sing their song of praise and perish.)<p>as then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a> wind and cherub are both to be associated together in thought as the vehicle of the divine activity in the world, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> the angel of Jahve represents the energy of the wind. </body></html>
