But here is a needful rule; Sing ye praises with understanding. As those that understand why and for what reasons they praise God, and what is the meaning of the service. It is not an acceptable service, if it is not a reasonable service. We are never to forget the end of Messiah's exaltation, so continually do the prophets dwell upon the conversion of the nations to the gospel of Christ. Why do we vainly fancy that we belong to him, unless the Spirit reign in our hearts by faith? Lord, is it not thy glory and delight to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins, now that thou art exalted as a Prince and a Saviour? Set up thy kingdom in our hearts. Bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. And so sweetly constrain all the powers and faculties of the souls of thy redeemed, into holy love, fear, and delight in thee, that praise with the understanding may rise from every heart, both here and for ever, to Thee, our God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The princes of the people are gathered together - The marginal reading is, "The voluntary of the people are gathered unto the people of the God of Abraham." The word rendered "princes" - &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;  na&#770;d&#305;&#770;yb - means properly, voluntary, ready, prompt; then, generous, liberal; then, those of noble birth, princes, nobles. It is evidently used here in this latter sense. The word "people" here may mean either the people of Israel, or the people of other lands; but in this place it seems evidently to denote the latter. The words "are gathered together" may refer either to a voluntary or an involuntary assembling; meaning either that they came in chains as prisoners of war, subdued by the arms of the people of God, and thus rendering an involuntary tribute to their power and their religion; or that they came in a voluntary manner, and submitted themselves, acknowledging the God of Israel to be the true God. It seems to me that the connection requires that we should understand this in the former sense, as referring to the subjugation of the enemies of of the people of God, and to their being led along as captives, assembled thus from distant parts of the world as proof that the God of Israel reigned.<p>Even the people of the God of Abraham - The word "even" is not in the original. The meaning is, "to" the people of the God of Abraham; that is, they come and mingle with the people of the God of Abraham; or, they come as captives in war "to" that people, and confess in this manner that their God is the true God. The image is that of the assemblage of great numbers of foriegn princes and nobles as furnishing either a voluntary or involuntary acknowledgment of the fact that the God of Abraham was the true God, and that the people of Israel were his people.<p>For the shields of the earth belong unto God - Are of right his. This would seem to have been suggested by the marching in triumph of subdued and vanquished princes and warriors, their shields or weapons of war being borne along in the procession, demonstrating that Jehovah was King among the nations. It was seen in such a march that all those weapons of war "belonged" to him, or that he had a right to dispose of them, and to use them as he pleased.<p>He is greatly exalted - That is, one who can thus subdue nations, and lead along captive princes and warriors, "must" be a Being greatly exalted; a Being that has dominion over the nations of the earth. This completes the imagery in the psalm, and gives occasion for the shouts and the joys of triumph. God had shown that he was a great King over the earth. Princes and armies were subdued to his will. They were led along as captives, and were gathered together to the people of God, as if to acknowledge their own inferiority; and in this solemn manner the nations thus subdued owned Yahweh to be the true God. In a higher sense this will be true when all the earth shall be subdued by the power of truth, and when kings, and princes, and people everywhere shall come and acknowledge God, reigning through the Messiah, to be the King of all nations.

The prophetic eye of the Psalmist sees the willing subjects of the great King assembled to celebrate his glory. Not only the poor and the men of low estate are there, but nobles bow their willing necks to his sway. "All kings shall bow down before him." No people shall be unrepresented; their great men shall be good men, their royal ones regenerate ones. How august will be the parliament where the Lord Jesus shall open the court, and princes shall rise up to do him honour! "Even the people of the God of Abraham." That same God, who was known only to here and there a patriarch like the father of the faithful, shall be adored by a seed as many as the stars of heaven. The covenant promise shall be fulfilled, "In thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." Shiloh shall come, and "to him shall the gathering of the people be." Babel's dispersion shall be obliterated by the gathering arm of the Great Shepherd King.<p>"For the shields of the earth belong unto God." The insignia of pomp, the emblems of rank, the weapons of war, all must pay loyal homage to the King of all. Right honourables must honour Jesus, and majesties must own him to be far more majestic. Those who are earth's protectors, the shields of the commonwealth, derive their might from him, and are his. All principalities and powers must be subject unto Jehovah and his Christ, for "He is greatly exalted." In nature, in power, in character, in glory, there is none to compare with him. Oh, glorious vision of a coming era! Make haste, ye wheels of time! Meanwhile, ye saints, "Be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The princes of the people; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

So this is a prophecy of the conversion of the Gentiles; which also is intimated by the name here used, which is not his old and first name, Abram, but his new name, Abraham, given to him to signify that he should be <span class="ital">the father of many nations</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm" title="Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made you.">Genesis 17:5</a></span>.

The Targum is, "the people that believe in the God of Abraham".

The Massoretic text ot the next line must be rendered with R.V., ‘To be <span class="ital">the people of the God of Abraham’:</span> a bold phrase, reaching the very climax of Messianic hope, and hardly paralleled elsewhere. For though the nations are frequently spoken of as attaching themselves to Israel in the worship of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm" title="And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.">Isaiah 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-6.htm" title="Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and takes hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:6</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-20.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:">Zechariah 8:20</a> ff.; &c, &c), they are not called “the people of God.” This title is reserved for Israel, and only in the N.T. are the promises made to Israel extended to the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.">Romans 9:25</a>).

It is however to be noted that the consonants of the word ‘<span class="ital">am</span>’ ‘people’ are identical with those of ‘<span class="ital">im</span>, ‘with,’ and the LXX read them as the preposition (<span class="ital">with the God of A</span>.).

The psalmist, however, does not in consequence or this particular event call upon them to tremble with fear, but to rejoice; for fear is an involuntary, extorted inward emotion, but joy a perfectly voluntary one. The true and final victory of Jahve consists not in a submission that is brought about by war and bloodshed and in consternation that stupefies the mind, but in a change in the minds and hearts of the peoples, so that they render joyful worship unto Him. In order that He may thus become the God of all peoples, He has first of all become the God of Israel; and Israel longs that this the purpose of its election may be attained. Out of this longing springs the call in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>. The peoples are to show the God of revelation their joy by their gestures and their words; for Jahve is absolutely exalted (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, here it is a predicate, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a> it is an attribute), terrible, and the sphere of His dominion has Israel for its central point, not, however, for its limit, but it extends over the whole earth. Everything must do homage to Him in His own people, whether willingly or by constraint. According to the tenses employed, what is affirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a> appears to be a principle derived from their recent experience, inasmuch as the contemporary fact is not expressed in an historical form, but generalized and idealised. But &#1497;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>, is against this, since the choosing (election) is an act done once for all and not a continued act; we are therefore driven to regard the futures, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>, as a statement of historical facts.

On the contrary, &#1497;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; presupposes that in the event of the day God has shown Himself to be a faithful and powerful Lord [lit. feudal Lord] of the land of Israel; the hostile confederation had thought of nothing less than driving Israel entirely out of its inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-11.htm">2 Chronicles 20:11</a>). The Holy Land is called the pride (&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;) of Jacob, as being the gift of grace of which this, the people of God's love, can boast. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a> &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; has a different meaning (of the sin of pride), and again another sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a> (of the glory of all Israel in accordance with the promise); here it is similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>. &#1488;&#1514; has a conjunctive accent instead of being followed by Makkeph, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a> (these are the only three instances). The strophe which follows supports the view that the poet, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>, has a recent act of God before his mind. </body></html>
