In every prayer a good man lifts up his soul to God; especially when in trouble. We desire mercy from him; we hope he will show us mercy, and we will continue waiting on him till it come. The eyes of a servant are to his master's directing hand, expecting that he will appoint him his work. And also to his supplying hand. Servants look to their master or their mistress for their portion of meat in due season. And to God we must look for daily bread, for grace sufficient; from him we must receive it thankfully. Where can we look for help but to our Master? And, further, to his protecting hand. If the servant is wronged and injured in his work, who should right him, but his master? And to his correcting hand. Whither should sinners turn but to him that smote them? They humble themselves under God's mighty hand. And lastly, to his rewarding hand. Hypocrites look to the world's hand, thence they have their reward; but true Christians look to God as their Master and their Rewarder. God's people find little mercy with men; but this is their comfort, that with the Lord there is mercy. Scorning and contempt have been, are, and are likely to be, the lot of God's people in this world. It is hard to bear; but the servants of God should not complain if they are treated as his beloved Son was. Let us then, when ready to faint under trials, look unto Jesus, and by faith and prayer cast ourselves upon the mercy of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/123.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our soul is exceedingly filled - Thoroughly sated. This verse states the nature and the source of the contempt which they were called to bear.<p>With the scorning of those that are at ease - According to one view of these "Psalms of Degrees" (see the Introduction to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/120-1.htm">Psalm 120:1-7</a>) this would be an instance of an "ascent" in the sense, or of the going up of the thought, where in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-3.htm">Psalm 123:3</a> there was mention made in general of "contempt," and in this verse the thought is carried onward and upward, or there is an additional idea which gives intensity to it. It is the scorn proceeding from those who are at ease; that is, the frivolous, the affluent, the proud. The word scorning means derision, mockery. The idea in the Hebrew is derived from stammering, which the word properly means; and then, mockery, as repeating over the words of another, or imitating the voice of one in derision. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-19.htm">Job 22:19</a>. The phrase "those that are at ease" properly refers to those who are tranquil or quiet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-18.htm">Isaiah 32:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>; and then it is used of those who are living at ease; those who are living in self-indulgence and luxury, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-11.htm">Isaiah 32:11</a>. Here it would seem to refer to those who, in our language, are "in easy circumstances;" the affluent; those who are not compelled to toil: then, the frivolous, the fashionable, those in the upper walks of life. The contempt was aggravated by the fact that it came from that quarter; not from the low, the ignorant, the common, but from those who claimed to be refined, and who were distinguished in the world of gaiety, of rank, and of fashion. This, even for good people (such is human nature), is much more hard to bear than contempt is when it comes from those who are in the lower walks of life. In the latter case, perhaps, we feel that we can meet contempt with contempt; in the former we cannot. We disregard the opinions of those who are beneath us; there are few who are not affected by the opinions entertained of them by those who are above them.<p>And with the contempt of the proud - Those who are lifted up; either in rank, in condition, or in feeling. The essential idea is, that it was the contempt of those to whom mankind look up. Religious people have always had much of this to encounter, and often it is in fact a more severe test of the reality and power of religion than the loss of goods, or than bodily pains and penalties. We can bear much if we have the respect - the praise - of those above us; it is a very certain test of the reality and the power of our religion when we can bear the scorn of the great, the noble, the scientific, the frivolous, and the fashionable. Piety is more frequently checked and obscured by this than it is by persecution. It is more rare that piety shines brightly when the frivolous and the fashionable flown upon it than when princes attempt to crush it by power. The church has performed its duty better in the furnace of persecution than it has in the "happy" scenes of the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/123.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. of those that are at ease&#8212;self-complacently, disregarding God's law, and despising His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/123.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> With the scornful and contemptuous carriage of thine and our enemies, who live in great ease and glory, whilst we, thy people, are overwhelmed with manifold calamities. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/123.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease,.... That are in easy and affluent circumstances; abound in the things of this world, and have more than heart can wish; have no outward trouble, as other men, or as the saints have; nor any uneasiness of mind, on account of sin and their eternal state: they have been at ease from their youth; Satan, that has the possession of them, keeps the goods in peace; and their consciences are seared as with a red hot iron, and they are past feeling; though they are far from having any true solid peace of mind: and such persons are generally scorners of the saints, and load them with their gibes and jeers in a most insolent manner; which makes it very irksome and grievous to bear; <p>and with the contempt of the proud: who are proud of their natural abilities; of their wealth and riches, and of their honours and high places: and such are generally scorners, and deal in proud wrath; and, through their pride, persecute the poor saints with their reproaches, and by other ways; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>.

The reading &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, commended by Ewald, is a recollection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a> that is violently brought in here. The loving ones are comprehended with the beloved one, the children with the mother. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492; forms an alliteration with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;; the emphatic form &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; occurs even in other instances out of pause (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a> the alliteration of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; is again taken up, and both accord with the name of Jerusalem. Ad elegantiam facit, as Venema observes, perpetua vocum ad se invicem et omnium ad nomen Hierosolymae alliteratio. Both together mark the Song of degrees as such. Happiness, cries out the poet to the holy city from afar, be within thy bulwarks, prosperity within thy palaces, i.e., without and within. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, ramparts, circumvallation (from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, to surround, Arabic hawl, round about, equally correct whether written &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1500;), and &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; as the parallel word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-14.htm">Psalm 48:14</a>. The twofold motive of such an earnest wish for peace is love for the brethren and love for the house of God. For the sake of the brethren is he cheerfully resolved to speak peace (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>) concerning (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; with &#1488;&#1500; and &#1500;, to speak peace to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-9.htm">Psalm 85:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>) Jerusalem, for the sake of the house of Jahve will he strive after good (i.e., that which tends to her well-being) to her (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; &#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a>, cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>). For although he is now again far from Jerusalem after the visit that is over, he still remains united in love to the holy city as being the goal of his longing, and to those who dwell there as being his brethren and friends. Jerusalem is and will remain the heart of all Israel as surely as Jahve who has His house there, is the God of all Israel. </body></html>
