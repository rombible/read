In every prayer a good man lifts up his soul to God; especially when in trouble. We desire mercy from him; we hope he will show us mercy, and we will continue waiting on him till it come. The eyes of a servant are to his master's directing hand, expecting that he will appoint him his work. And also to his supplying hand. Servants look to their master or their mistress for their portion of meat in due season. And to God we must look for daily bread, for grace sufficient; from him we must receive it thankfully. Where can we look for help but to our Master? And, further, to his protecting hand. If the servant is wronged and injured in his work, who should right him, but his master? And to his correcting hand. Whither should sinners turn but to him that smote them? They humble themselves under God's mighty hand. And lastly, to his rewarding hand. Hypocrites look to the world's hand, thence they have their reward; but true Christians look to God as their Master and their Rewarder. God's people find little mercy with men; but this is their comfort, that with the Lord there is mercy. Scorning and contempt have been, are, and are likely to be, the lot of God's people in this world. It is hard to bear; but the servants of God should not complain if they are treated as his beloved Son was. Let us then, when ready to faint under trials, look unto Jesus, and by faith and prayer cast ourselves upon the mercy of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/123.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us - The language of earnest pleading, repeating with emphasis the object of the prayer.

Merit is not pleaded; for, though servants, they knew they were unprofitable ones: but mercy is asked; whether by the awakened sinner, under first convictions, or by the backsliding professor, for forgiveness of sins, under a sense of them, or as under the correcting: and chastising hand of God for them: and which is repeated, to show the state of their case, which requires mercy, and in haste; and the eagerness of their spirit, and the earnestness of their suit, their prayer being the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man; <p>for we are exceedingly filled with contempt; by reason of meanness in outward circumstances, the common lot of God's people; and therefore are reckoned the faith of the world, and the offscouring of all things: and on account of their religion, which wicked men make a jest of; reckon an engine of state, to keep people in awe of the civil magistrate; or a piece of priestcraft, to serve the lucrative views of a set of men; or as mere cant and enthusiasm, and a gloomy melancholy business, which none but fools will give into; and particularly on account of peculiar doctrines embraced, which are branded as novel, irrational, and licentious; and ordinances, which entirely depend on the sovereign will of the institutor of them. For these things, and the like, contempt was plentifully poured upon them; they had enough of it, and too much, so much that they could not bear it; it was become intolerable and loathsome, and the more, as it had been a long time continued on them. So Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret the word, rendered "exceedingly", of a long time. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/123.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> exceedingly filled with contempt.</span><p>(b) He declares that when the faithful are so full that they cannot endure the oppression and scorning of the wicked any more, there is always help above, if with hungry desires they call for it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/123.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">Have mercy upon us</span>] Be gracious unto us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for we are exceedingly filled</span> with <span class="ital">contempt</span>] Contumely has been as it were the daily food with which we have been crammed to loathing.

The reading &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, commended by Ewald, is a recollection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a> that is violently brought in here.

Ad elegantiam facit, as Venema observes, perpetua vocum ad se invicem et omnium ad nomen Hierosolymae alliteratio. Both together mark the Song of degrees as such. Happiness, cries out the poet to the holy city from afar, be within thy bulwarks, prosperity within thy palaces, i.e., without and within. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, ramparts, circumvallation (from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, to surround, Arabic hawl, round about, equally correct whether written &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1500;), and &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; as the parallel word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-14.htm">Psalm 48:14</a>. The twofold motive of such an earnest wish for peace is love for the brethren and love for the house of God. For the sake of the brethren is he cheerfully resolved to speak peace (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>) concerning (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; with &#1488;&#1500; and &#1500;, to speak peace to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-9.htm">Psalm 85:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>) Jerusalem, for the sake of the house of Jahve will he strive after good (i.e., that which tends to her well-being) to her (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; &#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a>, cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>). For although he is now again far from Jerusalem after the visit that is over, he still remains united in love to the holy city as being the goal of his longing, and to those who dwell there as being his brethren and friends. Jerusalem is and will remain the heart of all Israel as surely as Jahve who has His house there, is the God of all Israel. </body></html>
