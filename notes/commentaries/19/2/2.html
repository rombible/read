Its distinctive reference to an expected prince of the chosen people, who was to redeem them from their enemies, and fulfil completely all the Divine promises for them, probably dates from this psalm, or more distinctly from this psalm than from any one passage. At least, that the traditional Jewish interpretation had fastened upon it as of this importance is shown by the frequent and emphatic quotation of this psalm in the New Testament. (See New Testament use of these verses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25</a>, and Note in <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm" title="The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,">Psalm 2:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">The kings of the earth — </span>So called by way of contempt, and to show their madness in opposing the God of heaven.

David’s enemies urged and instigated each other in their opposition to him; and the Jewish priests, elders, and council instigated false witnesses to accuse the Messiah, Pilate to condemn him, and the people to clamour for his crucifixion; the people also instigated Pilate to release Barabbas, and crucify Jesus; and the devil instigated them all to perpetrate this impious murder: as he afterward instigated kings and nations to persecute, imprison, torture, and put to death, in a variety of ways, his apostles, evangelists, and other followers. See the apostolic exposition of these verses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25</a>. “Persecution,” says Dr. Horne, “may be carried on by the people, but it is raised and fomented by kings and rulers. After the ascension of Christ, and the effusion of the Spirit, the whole power of the Roman empire was employed in the same cause by those who, from time to time, swayed the sceptre of the world. But still, they who intended to extirpate the faith, and destroy the church, how many and how mighty soever they might be, were found only to ‘imagine a vain thing.’ And equally vain will every imagination be that exalteth itself against the counsels of God for the salvation of his people.” <span class="ital">Against the Lord — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">Jehovah, </span>either directly and professedly, or indirectly and by consequence, because against his counsel and command; <span class="ital">and against his Anointed — </span>Against the king whom he hath chosen and exalted: that is, in fact, against all religion in general, and against the Christian religion in particular. And it is certain, all that are enemies to Christ, whatever they may pretend, are enemies to God himself. Thus our Lord, <span class="ital">They have hated both me and my Father. </span>The great Author of our holy religion is here termed the Lord’s <span class="ital">Anointed, </span>or <span class="ital">Messiah, </span>or <span class="ital">Christ, </span>in allusion to the anointing of David to be king. He is both authorized and qualified to be the church’s head and king; is duly invested with the office, and every way fitted for it, and yet he is opposed by many; nay, is therefore opposed, because his opposers are impatient of God’s authority, envious at this king’s advancement, and have a rooted enmity to the Spirit of holiness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-6 We are here told who would appear as adversaries to Christ. As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies. Christ's throne is set up in his church, that is, in the hearts of all believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The kings of the earth - This verse is designed to give a more specific form to the general statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. In the first verse the psalmist sees a general commotion among the nations as engaged in some plan that he sees must be a vain one; here he describes more particularly the cause of the excitement, and gives a nearer view of what is occurring. He now sees kings and rulers engaged in a specific and definite plot against Yahweh and against His Anointed. The word "kings" here is a general term, which would be applicable to all rulers - as the kingly government was the only one then known, and the nations were under the control of absolute monarchs. A sufficient fulfillment would be found, however, if any rulers were engaged in doing what is here described.<p>Set themselves - Or, take their stand. The latter expression would perhaps better convey the sense of the original. It is the idea of taking a stand, or of setting themselves in array, which is denoted by the expression; - they combine; they resolve; they are fixed in their purpose. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm">Exodus 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>. The attitude here is that of firm or determined resistance.<p>And the rulers - A slight addition to the word kings. The sense is, that there was a general combination among all classes of rulers to accomplish what is here specified. It was not confined to any one class.<p>Take counsel together - Consult together. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>, "While they took counsel together against me." The word used here, &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;  yachad, means properly to found, to lay the foundation of, to establish; then, to be founded (Niphal); to support oneself; to lean upon - as, for example, to lean upon the elbow. Thus used, it is employed with reference to persons reclining or leaning upon a couch or cushion, especially as deliberating together, as the Orientals do in the divan or council. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-3.htm">Psalm 83:3</a>. The idea here is that of persons assembled to deliberate on an important matter.<p>Against the Lord - Against Jehovah - the small capitals of "Lord" in our common version indicating that the original word is Yahweh. The meaning is, that they were engaged in deliberating against Yahweh in respect to the matter here referred to - to wit, his purpose to place the "Anointed One," his King (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>), on the hill of Zion. It is not meant that they were in other respects arrayed against him, though it is true in fact that opposition to God in one respect may imply that there is an aversion to him in all respects, and that the same spirit which would lead men to oppose him in any one of his purposes would, if carried out, lead them to oppose him in all things.<p>And against his Anointed -  - &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;  mesh&#305;&#770;ycho&#770; - his Messiah: hence, our word Messiah, or Christ. The word means "Anointed," and the allusion is to the custom of anointing kings and priests with holy oil when setting them apart to office, or consecrating them to their work. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>, note. The word Messiah, or Anointed, is therefore of so general a character in its signification that its mere use would not determine to whom it was to be applied - whether to a king, to a priest, or to the Messiah properly so called. The reference is to be determined by something in the connection. All that the word here necessarily implies is, that there was some one whom Yahweh regarded as his Anointed one, whether king or priest, against whom the rulers of the earth had arrayed themselves. The subsequent part of the psalm Psa 2:6-7 enables us to ascertain that the reference here is to one who was a King, and that he sustained to Yahweh the relation of a Son. The New Testament, and the considerations suggested in the introduction to the psalm (Section 4), enable us to understand that the reference is to the Messiah properly so called - Jesus of Nazareth. This is expressly declared <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25-27</a> to have had its fulfillment in the purposes of Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, in rejecting the Saviour and putting him to death. No one can doubt that all that is here stated in the psalm had a complete fulfillment in their combining to reject him and to put him to death; and we are, therefore, to regard the psalm as particularly referring to this transaction. Their conduct was, however, an illustration of the common feelings of rulers and people concerning him, and it was proper to represent the nations in general as in commotion in regard to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. The kings and rulers lead on their subjects.<p>set themselves&#8212;take a stand.<p>take counsel&#8212;literally, "sit together," denoting their deliberation.<p>anointed&#8212;Hebrew, "Messiah"; Greek, "Christ" (Joh 1:41). Anointing, as an emblem of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, was conferred on prophets (Isa 6:1); priests (Ex 30:30); and kings (1Sa 10:1; 16:13; 1Ki 1:39). Hence this title well suited Him who holds all these offices, and was generally used by the Jews before His coming, to denote Him (Da 9:26). While the prophet has in view men's opposition generally, he here depicts it in its culminating aspect as seen in the events of Christ's great trial. Pilate and Herod, and the rulers of the Jews (Mt 27:1; Lu 23:1-25), with the furious mob, are vividly portrayed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The kings; </span> either those mentioned <span class="bld">2 Samuel 5 2Sa 8</span>; or rather Herod the Great, and the other Herod, and Pilate, and others with or after them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the earth; </span> so called in way of contempt, and to show their madness in opposing the God of heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Set themselves:</span> the word notes their firm purpose and professed hostility, and the combination of their counsels and forces. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against the Lord; </span> either directly and professedly; or indirectly and by consequence, because against his anointed, and against his counsel and command. <span class="ital">And</span>; or, <span class="ital">that is</span>, as that particle is oft used; the latter clause explaining the former, and showing in what sense they fought against that God whom they pretended to own and worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against his anointed; </span> against such a king whom God hath chosen and exalted, and wonderfully accomplished and set up for his work and service, who therefore will certainly defend him against all his enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The kings of the earth set themselves,....

Arab. chfd f. i. with the primary notion of firmly adhering, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-17.htm">Job 40:17</a>) in &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;, the teaching of Jahve, which is become Israel's &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, rule of life; in this he meditates profoundly by day and night (two acc. with the old accusative terminations am and ah). The perff. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> describe what he all along has never done, the fut. &#1497;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;, what he is always striving to do; &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; of a deep (cf. Arab. hjj, depressum esse), dull sound, as if vibrating between within and without, here signifies the quiet soliloquy (cf. Arab. hjs, mussitando secum loqui) of one who is searching and thinking.<p>With &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;,<p>(Note: By the Sheb stands Metheg (Gaja), as it does wherever a word, with Sheb in the first syllable, has Olewejored, Rebia magnum, or Dech without a conjunctive preceding, in case at least one vowel and no Metheg-except perhaps that standing before Sheb compos. - lies between the Sheb and the tone, e.g., &#1504;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; (with Dech) <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>, &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-15.htm">Psalm 91:15</a> and the like. The intonation of the accent is said in these instances to begin, by anticipation, with the fugitive e&#774;.)<p>in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, the development of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; now begins; it is the praet. consec.: he becomes in consequence of this, he is thereby, like a tree planted beside the water-courses, which yields its fruit at the proper season and its leaf does not fall off. In distinction from &#1504;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, according to Jalkut 614, &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; means firmly planted, so that no winds that may rage around it are able to remove it from its place (&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1502;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;). In &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1497; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, both &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and the plur. serve to give intensity to the figure; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490; (Arab. fal'g, from &#1508;&#1500;&#1490; to divide, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25</a>) means the brook meandering and cleaving its course for itself through the soil and stones; the plur. denotes either one brook regarded from its abundance of water, or even several which from different directions supply the tree with nourishing and refreshing moisture. In the relative clause the whole emphasis does not rest on &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; (Calvin: impii, licet praecoces fructus ostentent, nihil tamen producunt nisi abortivum), but &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; is the first, &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; the second tone-word: the fruit which one expects from it, it yields (equivalent to &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; it produces, elsewhere), and that at its appointed, proper time ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, for &#1506;&#1514; is  equals  &#1506;&#1491;&#1514; or &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;, like &#1512;&#1491;&#1514;, &#1500;&#1491;&#1514;, from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;), without ever disappointing that hope in the course of the recurring seasons. The clause &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500; is the other half of the relative clause: and its foliage does not fall off or wither (&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; like the synon. Arab. dbl, from the root &#1489;&#1500;).<p>The green foliage is an emblem of faith, which converts the water of life of the divine word into sap and strength, and the fruit, an emblem of works, which gradually ripen and scatter their blessings around; a tree that has lost its leaves, does not bring its fruit to maturity. It is only with &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;, where the language becomes unemblematic, that the man who loves the Law of God again becomes the direct subject. The accentuation treats this member of the verse as the third member of the relative clause; one may, however, say of a thriving plant &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, but not &#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;. This Hiph. (from &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, Arab. tslh, to divide, press forward, press through, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>) signifies both causative: to cause anything to go through, or prosper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a>), and transitive: to carry through, and intransitive: to succeed, prosper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5</a>). With the first meaning, Jahve would be the subject; with the third, the project of the righteous; with the middle one, the righteous man himself. This last is the most natural: everything he takes in hand he brings to a successful issue (an expression like <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">2 Chronicles 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-21.htm">2 Chronicles 31:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a>). What a richly flowing brook is to the tree that is planted on its bank, such is the word of God to him who devotes himself to it: it makes him, according to his position and calling, ever fruitful in good and well-timed deeds and keeps him fresh in his inner and outward life, and whatsoever such an one undertakes, he brings to a successful issue, for the might of the word and of the blessing of God is in his actions. </body></html>
