The introducing God as thus laughing at, and deriding his enemies, is in the true spirit of poetry, and with the utmost propriety and dignity. The whole description is grand: Jehovah is he who is seated in the heavens, far beyond the effects of their rage and malice: from thence he sees their secret counsels, confederate armies, and united obstinate endeavours to oppose what he had solemnly decreed.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-6 We are here told who would appear as adversaries to Christ. As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies. Christ's throne is set up in his church, that is, in the hearts of all believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that sitteth in the heavens - God, represented as having his home, his seat, his throne in heaven, and thence administering the affairs of the world. This verse commences the second strophe or stanza of the psalm; and this strophe <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4-6</a> corresponds with the first <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a> in its structure. The former describes the feelings and purposes of those who would cast off the government of God; this describes the feelings and purposes of God in the same order, for in each case the psalmist describes what is done, and then what is said: the nations rage tumultuously <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, and then say <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>, "Let us break their bands." God sits calmly in the heavens, smiling on their vain attempts <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, and then solemnly declares <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5-6</a> that, in spite of all their opposition, he "has set his King upon his holy hill of Zion." There is much sublimity in this description. While men rage and are tumultuous in opposing his plans, he sits calm and undisturbed in his own heaven. Compare the notes at the similar place in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>.<p>Shall laugh - Will smile at their vain attempts; will not be disturbed or agitated by their efforts; will go calmly on in the execution of his purposes. Compare as above <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-13.htm">Psalm 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-8.htm">Psalm 59:8</a>. This is, of course, to be regarded as spoken after the manner of men, and it means that God will go steadily forward in the accomplishment of his purposes. There is included also the idea that he will look with contempt on their vain and futile efforts.<p>The Lord shall have them in derision - The same idea is expressed here in a varied form, as is the custom in parallelism in Hebrew poetry. The Hebrew word &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;  la&#770;&#8219;ag, means properly to stammer; then to speak in a barbarous or foreign tongue; then to mock or deride, by imitating the stammering voice of anyone. Gesenius, Lexicon Here it is spoken of God, and, of course, is not to be understood literally, anymore than when eyes, and hands, and feet are spoken of as pertaining to him. The meaning is, that there is a result in the case, in the Divine Mind, as if he mocked or derided the vain attempts of men; that is, he goes calmly forward in the execution of his own purposes, and he looks upon and regards their efforts as vain, as we do the efforts of others when we mock or deride them. The truth taught in this verse is, that God will carry forward his own plans in spite of all the attempts of men to thwart them. This general truth may lie stated in two forms:<p>(1) He sits undisturbed and unmoved in heaven while men rage against him, and while they combine to cast off his authority.<p>(2) He carries forward his own plans in spite of them. This he does:<p>(a) directly, accomplishing his schemes without regard to their attempts; and<p>(b) by making their purposes tributary to his own, so making them the instruments in carrying out his own plans.

At the rage and tumult of the Heathen; at the vain imaginations of the people; at the opposition of the kings of the earth; at the mad counsel of the rulers, against him and his Messiah; and at their proposal to one another to throw off the yoke and government of them both. This is a periphrasis of God, "who dwells in the heavens", and sits there enthroned; though he is not included and comprehended in them, but is everywhere; and his being there is mentioned in opposition to the kings of the earth, and the people in it; and to show the vast distance there is between them, and how they are as nothing to him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>; and how vain and fruitless their attempts must be against him and his Messiah: and his sitting there still and quiet, serene and undisturbed, is opposed to the running to and fro, and the tumultuous and riotous assembling of the Heathen. Laughing is ascribed unto him, according to the language of men, as the Jewish writers speak (d), by an anthropopathy; in the same sense as he is said to repent and grieve, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>; and expresses his security from all their attempts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-22.htm">Job 5:22</a>; and the contempt he has them in, and the certain punishment of them, and the aggravation of it; who will not only then laugh at them himself, but expose them to the laughter and scorn of others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>; <p>the Lord shall have them in derision; which is a repetition of the same thing in other words; and is made partly to show the certainty of their disappointment and ruin, and partly to explain who is meant by him that sits in the heavens.

With &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; an inference is drawn from this moral characteristic of the ungodly: just on account of their inner worthlessness and instability they do not stand &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;. This is the word for the judgment of just recompense to which God brings each individual man and all without exception with all their words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>), -  His righteous government, which takes cognisance of the whole life of each individual and the history of nations and recompenses according to desert. In this judgment the ungodly cannot stand (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; to continue to stand, like &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a> to keep one's self erect), nor sinners &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;.
