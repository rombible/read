As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies. Christ's throne is set up in his church, that is, in the hearts of all believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why do the heathen rage - "Why do nations make a noise?" Prof. Alexander. The word "heathen" here - &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;  go&#770;yim - means properly "nations," with out respect, so far as the word is concerned, to the character of the nations. It was applied by the Hebrews to the surrounding nations, or to all other people than their own; and as those nations were in fact pagans, or idolators, the word came to have this signification. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-8.htm">Nehemiah 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-30.htm">Ezekiel 23:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-11.htm">Ezekiel 30:11</a>; compare &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;  'a&#770;da&#770;m, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>. The word Gentile among the Hebrews (Greek, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ethnos expressed the same thing. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-32.htm">Matthew 6:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-21.htm">Matthew 12:21</a>, et soepe. The word rendered "rage" - &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;  ra&#770;gash - means to make a noise or tumult, and would be expressive of violent commotion or agitation. It occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures only in this place, though the corresponding Chaldee word - &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;  regash is found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-6.htm">Daniel 6:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-11.htm">Daniel 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-15.htm">Daniel 6:15</a> - rendered in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-6.htm">Daniel 6:6</a>, "assembled together," in the margin "came tumultuously," - and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-11.htm">Daniel 6:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-15.htm">Daniel 6:15</a>, rendered "assembled." The psalmist here sees the nations in violent agitation or commotion, as if under high excitement, engaged in accomplishing some purpose - rushing on to secure something, or to prevent something. The image of a mob, or of a tumultuous unregulated assemblage, would probably convey the idea of the psalmist. The word itself does not enable us to determine how extensive this agitation would be, but it is evidently implied that it would be a somewhat general movement; a movement in which more than one nation or people would participate. The matter in hand was something that affected the nations generally, and which would produce violent agitation among them.<p>And the people - &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  Le'umiym. A word expressing substantially the same idea, that of people, or nations, and referring here to the same thing as the word rendered "heathen" - according to the laws of Hebrew parallelism in poetry. It is the people here that are seen in violent agitation: the conduct of the rulers, as associated with them, is referred to in the next verse.<p>Imagine - Our word "imagine" does not precisely express the idea here. We mean by it, "to form a notion or idea in the mind; to fancy." Webster. The Hebrew word, &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;  ha&#770;ga&#770;h, is the same which, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, is rendered "meditate." See the notes at that verse. It means here that the mind is engaged in deliberating on it; that it plans, devises, or forms a purpose; - in other words, the persons referred to are thinking about some purpose which is here called a vain purpose; they are meditating some project which excites deep thought, but which cannot be effectual.<p>A vain thing - That is, which will prove to be a vain thing, or a thing which they cannot accomplish. It cannot mean that they were engaged in forming plans which they supposed would be vain - for no persons would form such plans; but that they were engaged in designs which the result would show to be unsuccessful. The reference here is to the agitation among the nations in respect to the divine purpose to set up the Messiah as king over the world, and to the opposition which this would create among the nations of the earth. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>. An ample fulfillment of this occurred in the opposition to him when he came in the flesh, and in the resistance everywhere made since his death to his reign upon the earth. Nothing has produced more agitation in the world (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>), and nothing still excites more determined resistance. The truths taught in this verse are:<p>(1) that sinners are opposed - even so much as to produce violent agitation of mind, and a fixed and determined purpose - to the plans and decrees of God, especially with respect to the reign of the Messiah; and<p>(2) that their plans to resist this will be vain and ineffectual; wisely as their schemes may seem to be laid, and determined as they themselves are in regard to their execution, yet they must find them vain.<p>What is implied here of the particular plans against the Messiah, is true of all the purposes of sinners, when they array themselves against the government of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 2<p>Ps 2:1-12. The number and authorship of this Psalm are stated (Ac 4:25; 13:33). Though the warlike events of David's reign may have suggested its imagery, the scenes depicted and the subjects presented can only find a fulfilment in the history and character of Jesus Christ, to which, as above cited and in Heb 1:5; 5:5, the New Testament writers most distinctly testify. In a most animated and highly poetical style, the writer, in "four stanzas of three verses each," sets forth the inveterate and furious, though futile, hostility of men to God and His anointed, God's determination to carry out His purpose, that purpose as stated more fully by His Son, the establishment of the Mediatorial kingdom, and the imminent danger of all who resist, as well as the blessing of all who welcome this mighty and triumphant king.<p>1. Why do the heathen, &c.&#8212;Beholding, in prophetic vision, the peoples and nations, as if in a tumultuous assembly, raging with a fury like the raging of the sea, designing to resist God's government, the writer breaks forth into an exclamation in which are mingled surprise at their folly, and indignation at their rebellion.<p>heathen&#8212;nations generally, not as opposed to Jews.<p>the people&#8212;or, literally, "peoples," or races of men.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/2.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?<p>2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,<p>3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.<p>We have, in these first three verses, a description of the hatred of human nature against the Christ of God. No better comment is needed upon it than the apostolic song in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-28.htm">Acts 4:28</a> : "For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done." The Psalm begins abruptly with an angry interrogation; and well it may: it is surely but little to be wondered at, that the sight of creatures in arms against their God should amaze the psalmist's mind. We see the heathen raging, roaring like the sea, tossed to and fro with restless waves, as the ocean in a storm; and then we mark the people in their hearts imagining a vain thing against God. Where there is much rage there is generally some folly, and in this case there is an excess of it. Note, that the commotion is not caused by the people only, but their leaders foment the rebellion. "The kings of the earth set themselves." In determined malice they arrayed themselves in opposition against God. It was not temporary rage, but deep-seated hate, for they set themselves resolutely to withstand the Prince of Peace. "And the rulers take counsel together." They go about their warfare craftily, not with foolish haste, but deliberately. They use all the skill which art can give. Like Pharaoh, they cry, "Let us deal wisely with them." O that men were half as careful in God's service to serve him wisely, as his enemies are to attack his kingdom craftily. Sinners have their wits about them, and yet saints are dull. But what say they? what is the meaning of this commotion? "Let us break their bands asunder." "Let us be free to commit all manner of abominations. Let us be our own gods. Let us rid ourselves of all restraint." Gathering impudence by the traitorous proposition of rebellion, they add - "let us cast away;" as if it were an easy matter, - "let us fling off 'their cords from us.'" What! O ye kings, do ye think yourselves Samsons? and are the bands of Omnipotence but as green withs before you? Do you dream that you shall snap to pieces and destroy the mandates of God - the decrees of the Most High - as if they were but tow? And do ye say, "Let us cast away their cords from us?" Yes! There are monarchs who have spoken thus, and there are still rebels upon thrones. However mad the resolution to revolt from God, it is one in which man has persevered ever since his creation, and he continues in it to this very day. The glorious reign of Jesus in the latter day will not be consummated, until a terrible struggle has convulsed the nations. His coming will be as a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap, and the day thereof shall burn as an oven. Earth loves not her rightful monarch, but clings to the usurper's sway: the terrible conflicts of the last days will illustrate both the world's love of sin and Jehovah's power to give the kingdom to his only Begotten. To a graceless neck the yoke of Christ is intolerable, but to the saved sinner it is easy and light. We may judge ourselves by this, do we love that yoke, or do we wish to cast it from us? <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The penman of this Psalm was David, as is affirmed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25</a></span>. As for the matter or subject of it, it may seem to have some respect unto David, and to his advancement to and settlement in the throne of Judah and Israel; but the chief design and scope of it, and the primary intention of the Holy Ghost in it, was to describe the Messiah and his kingdom, as is manifest, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Or "the nations"; which some understand of the Jews, who are so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; because of their various tribes; and of their rage against the Messiah there have been many instances; as when they gnashed upon him with their teeth, and at several times took up stones to stone him, and cried out in a most furious and wrathful manner, crucify him, crucify him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28</a>; though it is best to interpret it of the Gentiles, as the apostles seem to do in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>. The Hebrew word translated "rage" is by one Jewish writer (z) explained by  "associate" or "meet together"; and which is often the sense of the word in the Syriac and Chaldee languages, in which it is more used; and another (a) says, that it is expressive of "gathering together, and of a multitude"; it intends a tumultuous gathering together, as is that of a mob, with great confusion and noise (b); and so the Gentiles, the Roman soldiers, gathered together, even multitudes of them, and came out with Judas at the head of them, with swords and staves, to apprehend Christ and bring him to the chief priests and elders, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-47.htm">Matthew 26:47</a>; these assembled together in Pilate's hall, when Christ was condemned to be crucified, and insulted him in a most rude and shocking manner, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-2.htm">Matthew 26:2</a>; and many are the instances of the Gentiles rising in mobs, and appearing in riotous assemblies, making tumults and uproars against the apostles to oppose them, and the spread of the Gospel by them; to which they were sometimes instigated by the unbelieving Jews, and sometimes by their own worldly interest; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>, to which may be added, as instances of this tumult and rage, the violent persecutions both of the Pagan emperors and of the Papists, which last are called Gentiles as well as the other; for this respects the kingdom of Christ, or the Gospel dispensations, from the beginning to the end; <p>and the people imagine a vain thing? by "the people" are meant the people of Israel, who were once God's peculiar people, and who were distinguished by him with peculiar favours above all others, and in whom this prophecy has been remarkably fulfilled; they imagine it and meditated a vain thing when they thought the Messiah would be a temporal King, and set up a kingdom, on earth in great worldly splendour and glory, and rejected Jesus, the true Messiah, because he did not answer to these their carnal imaginations; they meditated a vain thing when they sought to take away the good name and reputation of Christ, by fixing opprobrious names and injurious charges upon him, for Wisdom has been justified of her children, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; and so they did when they meditated his death, with those vain hopes that he should die and his name perish, and should lie down in the grave and never rise more, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-5.htm">Psalm 41:5</a>; for he not only rose from the dead, but his name was more famous after his death than before; they imagined a vain thing when they took so much precaution to prevent the disciples stealing his body out of the sepulchre, and giving out that he was risen from the dead, and more especially when he was risen, to hire the soldiers to tell a lie in order to stifle and discredit the report of it; they meditated vain things when they attempted to oppose the apostles, and hinder the preaching of the Gospel by them, which they often did, as the Acts of the Apostles testify; and it was after one of these attempts that the apostles, in their address to God, made use of this very passage of Scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>; and they still meditate a vain thing in that they imagine Jesus of Nazareth is not the Messiah, and that the Messiah is not yet come; and in that they are expecting and looking for him. Now the Psalmist, or the Holy Ghost by him, asks "why" all this? what should move the Gentiles and the Jews to so much rage, tumult, and opposition against an holy and innocent person, and who went about doing good as he did? what end they could have in it, or serve by it? and how they could expect to succeed? what would all their rage and not, and vain imagination, signify? it is strongly suggested hereby that it would all be in vain and to no purpose, as well as what follows. <p>(z) Aben Ezra in loc.

He "sees Jehovah upon his throne, and Messiah entering upon his universal dominion. The enemies of both on earth rise up against them with frantic tumult, and vainly strive to east off the fetters of their rule." Hence his sudden outburst. "What ails the heathen (<span class="accented">goim</span>)," he says. "that they rage?" or "make an uproar" (Kay), or "assemble tumultuously" (margin of Authorized Version and Revised,Version)? What are they about? What do they design? <span class="cmt_word">And why do the people</span> - rather, <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">peoples</span>, or "the masses" (Kay) - <span class="cmt_word">imagine</span> (or, meditate) <span class="cmt_word">a vain thing?</span> It must be "a vain thing;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a purpose which will come to naught, if it is something opposed to the will of Jehovah and Messiah. The vision shows the psalmist Jew and Gentile banded together against the gospel of Christ. Its scope is not exhausted by the exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-26.htm">Acts 4:26</a>, but extends to the whole struggle between Christianity on the one hand, and Judaism and paganism on the other. "The peoples" still to this day "imagine a vain thing" - imagine that Christianity will succumb to the assaults made upon it - will fade, die away, and disappear. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The exclamatory &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;, as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-34.htm">Proverbs 8:34</a>, has Gaja (Metheg) by the Aleph, and in some Codd. even a second by &#1513;&#1473;, because it is intended to be read ashere&#770; as an exception, on account of the significance of the word (Baer, in Comm. ii. 495).

Therefore: Blessed is he who does not walk in the state of mind which the ungodly cherish, much less that he should associate with the vicious life of sinners, or even delight in the company of those who scoff at religion. The description now continues with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; (imo si, Ges. 155, 2, 9): but (if) his delight is,  equals  (substantival instead of the verbal clause:) he delights (&#1495;&#1508;&#1509; cf. Arab. chfd f. i. with the primary notion of firmly adhering, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-17.htm">Job 40:17</a>) in &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;, the teaching of Jahve, which is become Israel's &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, rule of life; in this he meditates profoundly by day and night (two acc. with the old accusative terminations am and ah). The perff. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> describe what he all along has never done, the fut. &#1497;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;, what he is always striving to do; &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; of a deep (cf. Arab. hjj, depressum esse), dull sound, as if vibrating between within and without, here signifies the quiet soliloquy (cf. Arab. hjs, mussitando secum loqui) of one who is searching and thinking.<p>With &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;,<p>(Note: By the Sheb stands Metheg (Gaja), as it does wherever a word, with Sheb in the first syllable, has Olewejored, Rebia magnum, or Dech without a conjunctive preceding, in case at least one vowel and no Metheg-except perhaps that standing before Sheb compos. - lies between the Sheb and the tone, e.g., &#1504;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1492; (with Dech) <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>, &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-15.htm">Psalm 91:15</a> and the like. The intonation of the accent is said in these instances to begin, by anticipation, with the fugitive e&#774;.)<p>in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, the development of the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; now begins; it is the praet. consec.: he becomes in consequence of this, he is thereby, like a tree planted beside the water-courses, which yields its fruit at the proper season and its leaf does not fall off. In distinction from &#1504;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, according to Jalkut 614, &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; means firmly planted, so that no winds that may rage around it are able to remove it from its place (&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1494;&#1497;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1502;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;). In &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1497; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, both &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and the plur. serve to give intensity to the figure; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490; (Arab. fal'g, from &#1508;&#1500;&#1490; to divide, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25</a>) means the brook meandering and cleaving its course for itself through the soil and stones; the plur. denotes either one brook regarded from its abundance of water, or even several which from different directions supply the tree with nourishing and refreshing moisture. In the relative clause the whole emphasis does not rest on &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; (Calvin: impii, licet praecoces fructus ostentent, nihil tamen producunt nisi abortivum), but &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; is the first, &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; the second tone-word: the fruit which one expects from it, it yields (equivalent to &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; it produces, elsewhere), and that at its appointed, proper time ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, for &#1506;&#1514; is  equals  &#1506;&#1491;&#1514; or &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;, like &#1512;&#1491;&#1514;, &#1500;&#1491;&#1514;, from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;), without ever disappointing that hope in the course of the recurring seasons. The clause &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500; is the other half of the relative clause: and its foliage does not fall off or wither (&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; like the synon. Arab. dbl, from the root &#1489;&#1500;).<p>The green foliage is an emblem of faith, which converts the water of life of the divine word into sap and strength, and the fruit, an emblem of works, which gradually ripen and scatter their blessings around; a tree that has lost its leaves, does not bring its fruit to maturity. It is only with &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;, where the language becomes unemblematic, that the man who loves the Law of God again becomes the direct subject. The accentuation treats this member of the verse as the third member of the relative clause; one may, however, say of a thriving plant &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, but not &#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;. This Hiph. (from &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, Arab. tslh, to divide, press forward, press through, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>) signifies both causative: to cause anything to go through, or prosper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a>), and transitive: to carry through, and intransitive: to succeed, prosper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5</a>). With the first meaning, Jahve would be the subject; with the third, the project of the righteous; with the middle one, the righteous man himself. This last is the most natural: everything he takes in hand he brings to a successful issue (an expression like <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">2 Chronicles 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-21.htm">2 Chronicles 31:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a>). What a richly flowing brook is to the tree that is planted on its bank, such is the word of God to him who devotes himself to it: it makes him, according to his position and calling, ever fruitful in good and well-timed deeds and keeps him fresh in his inner and outward life, and whatsoever such an one undertakes, he brings to a successful issue, for the might of the word and of the blessing of God is in his actions. </body></html>
