In other words, by pouring out his indignation on the adversaries of his anointed king, he shall no less evidently convict and reprove their folly and impiety than if he had actually spoken to them in terrible majesty from his eternal throne. The word <span class="greekheb">יבהלמו</span>, <span class="ital">jebahaleemo, </span>in the next clause, rendered <span class="ital">vex, </span>and in the margin, <span class="ital">trouble them, </span>has a very strong meaning, implying “that God would put them into the <span class="ital">utmost terror and consternation of mind, </span>and deprive them of all power and ability of soul and body, to save themselves from the vengeance which should be executed upon them:” a prediction most awfully verified in the terrible destruction which came upon the murderers of Christ and the persecutors of his church and people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-6 We are here told who would appear as adversaries to Christ. As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies. Christ's throne is set up in his church, that is, in the hearts of all believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then shall he speak unto them - That is, this seeming indifference and unconcern will not last forever. He will not always look calmly on, nor will he suffer them to accomplish their purposes without interposing. When he has shown how he regards their schemes - how impotent they are, how much they are really the objects of derision, considered as an attempt to cast off his authority - he will interpose and declare his own purposes - his determination to establish his king on the hill of Zion. This is implied in the word "then."<p>In his wrath - In anger. His contempt for their plans will be followed by indignation against themselves for forming such plans, and for their efforts to execute them. One of these things is not inconsistent with the other, for the purpose of the rebels may be very weak and futile, and yet their wickedness in forming the plan may be very great. The weakness of the scheme, and the fact that it will be vain, does not change the character of him who has made it; the fact that he is foolish does not prove that he is not wicked. God will treat the scheme and those who form it as they deserve - the one with contempt, the other with his wrath. The word "wrath" here, it is hardly necessary to say, should be interpreted in the same manner as the word "laugh" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, not as denoting a feeling precisely like that which exists in the human mind, subject as man is to unreasonable passion, but as it is proper to apply it to God - the strong conviction (without passion or personal feeling) of the evil of sin, and the expression of his purpose in a manner adapted to show that evil, and to restrain others from its commission. It means that he will speak to them as if he were angry; or that his treatment of them will be such as men experience from others when they are angry.<p>And vex them - The word here rendered "vex" - &#1489;&#1492;&#1500;  ba&#770;hal - means in the original or Qal form, to tremble; and then, in the form used here, the Piel, to cause to tremble, to terrify, to strike with consternation. This might be done either by a threat or by some judgment indicative of displeasure or anger. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-15.htm">Psalm 83:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-44.htm">Daniel 11:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-10.htm">Job 22:10</a>. The idea here is that he would alarm them, or make them quake with fear, by what is specified of his purpose; to wit, by his determination to set his King on his holy hill, and by placing the scepter of the earth in his hands. Their designs, therefore, would be frustrated, and if they did not submit to him they must perish (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9-12</a>).<p>In his sore displeasure - literally, in his "heat" or "burning," that is, in his anger; as we speak of one that is inflamed with anger, or that burns with indignation; or, as we speak of the passions, kindling into a flame. The meaning here is, that God would be displeased with their purposes, and that the expression of his design would be adapted to fill them with the deepest alarm. Of course, all such words are to be interpreted in accordance with what we know to be the nature of God, and not in accordance with the same passions in men. God is opposed to sin, and will express his opposition as if he felt angry, but it will be in the most calm manner, and not as the result of passion. It will be simply because it ought to be so. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Then shall he speak&#8212;His righteous indignation as well as contempt is roused.

At the moment when their power is at its height, and their fury most violent, then shall his Word go forth against them. And what is it that he says? - it is a very galling sentence - "Yet," says he, "despite your malice, despite your tumultuous gatherings, despite the wisdom of your counsels, despite the craft of your lawgivers, 'yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.'" Is not that a grand exclamation! He has already done that which the enemy seeks to prevent. While they are proposing, he has disposed the matter. Jehovah's will is done, and man's will frets and raves in vain. God's Anointed is appointed, and shall not be disappointed. Look back through all the ages of infidelity, hearken to the high and hard things which men have spoken against the Most High, listen to the rolling thunder of earth's volleys against the Majesty of heaven, and then think that God is saying all the while, "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." Yet Jesus reigns, yet he sees of the travail of his soul, and "his unsuffering kingdom yet shall come" when he shall take unto himself his great power, and reign from the river unto the ends of the earth. Even now he reigns in Zion, and our glad lips sound forth the praises of the Prince of Peace. Greater conflicts may here be foretold, but we may be confident that victory will be given to our Lord and King. Glorious triumphs are yet to come; hasten them, we pray thee, O Lord! It is Zion's glory and joy that her King is in her, guarding her from foes, and filling her with good things. Jesus sits upon the throne of grace, and the throne of power in the midst of his church. In him is Zion's best safeguard; let her citizens be glad in him.<p>"Thy walls are strength, and at thy gates<p>A guard of heavenly warriors waits;<p>Nor shall thy deep foundations move,<p>Fixed on his counsels and his love.<p>Thy foes in vain designs engage;<p>Against his throne in vain they rage,<p>Like rising waves, with, angry roar,<p>That dash and die upon the shore." <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> in the midst of all their plots and confidences of success. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall he speak to them in his wrath; </span> he shall severely rebuke them, not so much verbally as really, by dreadful judgments.

Or, "and he shall speak to them"; so Noldius: that is, the Lord that sits in the heavens, and laughs, and has the Heathen, the people, the kings and rulers in derision, shall not only silently despise their furious and concerted opposition to him and his Messiah, but shall at last speak out unto them, not in his word, but in his providences; and not in love, as to his own people, when he chastises them, but in great wrath, inflicting severe and just punishment.

With &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; an inference is drawn from this moral characteristic of the ungodly: just on account of their inner worthlessness and instability they do not stand &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;. This is the word for the judgment of just recompense to which God brings each individual man and all without exception with all their words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>), -  His righteous government, which takes cognisance of the whole life of each individual and the history of nations and recompenses according to desert. In this judgment the ungodly cannot stand (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; to continue to stand, like &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a> to keep one's self erect), nor sinners &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;.
