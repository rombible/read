As this world is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party, and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. But the rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths and precepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldly lusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They would break asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God's commandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as they can. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holy a government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven upon earth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful a kingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, and is Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies.

They who are engaged in this combination or conspiracy regard Yahweh and his Anointed as one, and as having one object - to set up a dominion over the world. Hence, they take counsel against both; and, with the same purpose and design, endeavor to cast off the authority of each. The word "bands" here refers to the restraints imposed by their authority. The figure is probably taken from fastening a yoke on oxen, or the bands or cords which were used in plowing - the bands of the yoke being significant of their subjection to the authority or will of another. The same figure is used by the Saviour in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a> : "Take my yoke upon you." The idea here is, that it was the purpose of Yahweh and his Anointed to establish a dominion over men, and that it was equally the purpose of the kings and rulers here referred to that it should not be done.<p>And cast away their cords from us - The same idea under another form - the cords referring not to that which would bind them as prisoners, but to the ropes or thongs which bound oxen to the plow; and, hence, to that which would bind men to the service of God. The word translated "cords" is a stronger word than that which is rendered bands. It means properly what is twisted or interlaced, and refers to the usual manner in which ropes are made. Perhaps, also, in the words "let us cast away" there is the expression of an idea that it could be easily done: that they had only to will it, and it would be done. Together, the expressions refer to the purpose among men to cast off the government of God, and especially that part of his administration which refers to his purpose to establish a kingdom under the Messiah. It thus indicates a prevalent state of the human mind as being impatient of the restraints and authority of God, and especially of the dominion of his Son, anointed as King.<p>The passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a> proves:<p>(1) that the government of Yahweh, the true God, and the Messiah or Christ, is the same;<p>(2) that opposition to the Messiah, or to Christ, is in fact opposition to the purposes of the true God;<p>(3) that it may be expected that men will oppose that government, and there will be agitation and commotion in endeavoring to throw it off.<p>The passage, considered as referring to the Messiah, had an ample fulfillment<p>(a) in the purposes of the high priests, of Herod, and of Pilate, to put him to death, and in the general rejection of him by his own countrymen;<p>(b) in the general conduct of mankind - in their impatience of the restraints of the law of God, and especially of that law as promulgated by the Saviour, demanding submission and obedience to him; and<p>(c) in the conduct of individual sinners - in the opposition of the human heart to the authority of the Lord Jesus.<p>The passage before us is just as applicable to the world now as it was to the time when the Saviour personally appeared on the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

In the relative clause the whole emphasis does not rest on &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; (Calvin: impii, licet praecoces fructus ostentent, nihil tamen producunt nisi abortivum), but &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; is the first, &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; the second tone-word: the fruit which one expects from it, it yields (equivalent to &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; it produces, elsewhere), and that at its appointed, proper time ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, for &#1506;&#1514; is  equals  &#1506;&#1491;&#1514; or &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;, like &#1512;&#1491;&#1514;, &#1500;&#1491;&#1514;, from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;), without ever disappointing that hope in the course of the recurring seasons. The clause &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500; is the other half of the relative clause: and its foliage does not fall off or wither (&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; like the synon. Arab. dbl, from the root &#1489;&#1500;).<p>The green foliage is an emblem of faith, which converts the water of life of the divine word into sap and strength, and the fruit, an emblem of works, which gradually ripen and scatter their blessings around; a tree that has lost its leaves, does not bring its fruit to maturity. It is only with &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;, where the language becomes unemblematic, that the man who loves the Law of God again becomes the direct subject. The accentuation treats this member of the verse as the third member of the relative clause; one may, however, say of a thriving plant &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, but not &#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;. This Hiph. (from &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;, Arab. tslh, to divide, press forward, press through, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>) signifies both causative: to cause anything to go through, or prosper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a>), and transitive: to carry through, and intransitive: to succeed, prosper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5</a>). With the first meaning, Jahve would be the subject; with the third, the project of the righteous; with the middle one, the righteous man himself. This last is the most natural: everything he takes in hand he brings to a successful issue (an expression like <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">2 Chronicles 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-21.htm">2 Chronicles 31:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a>). What a richly flowing brook is to the tree that is planted on its bank, such is the word of God to him who devotes himself to it: it makes him, according to his position and calling, ever fruitful in good and well-timed deeds and keeps him fresh in his inner and outward life, and whatsoever such an one undertakes, he brings to a successful issue, for the might of the word and of the blessing of God is in his actions. </body></html>
