The jackal is the animal that best answers these requirements.

Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, and must be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, therefore judges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive us from our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from our comfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not render us careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on by persecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back from God. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered unto death, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, ver. 25,26. Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner's pleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one of them shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased, promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, does away every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeem us for thy mercies' sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons - Or rather, "That thou hast crushed us in the place of dragons." The connection is continued from the previous verse: "Our heart is not so turned back, nor have our steps so declined from thy path, that thou shouldst crush us in the place of dragons." That is, we have been guilty of no such apostasy and infidelity as to account for the fact that thou hast dealt with us in this manner, or make it necessary and proper that we should thus be crushed and overthrown The word rendered "dragons" - &#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;  tann&#305;&#770;yn - means either a great fish; a sea monster; a serpent; a dragon; or a crocodile. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>. It may also mean a jackal, a fox, or a wolf. DeWette renders it here, jackals. The idea in the passage is essentially the same, whichever interpretation of the word is adopted. The "place of dragons" would denote the place where such monsters are found, or where they had their abode; that is to say, in desolate places; wastes; deserts; old ruins; depopulated towns. See the notes, as above, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>. The meaning here would be, therefore, that they had been vanquished; that their cities and towns had been reduced to ruins; that their land had been laid waste; that the place where they had been "sore broken" was in fact a fit abode for wild beasts and monsters.<p>And covered us with the shadow of death - Our land has been covered with a dark and dismal shade, as if Death had cast his image or shadow over it. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm">Job 3:5</a>, note; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, note.

Where men, comparable to dragons or their poison and cruelty, dwell; particularly in Rome, and the Roman jurisdiction, both Pagan and Papal, the seat of Satan the great red dragon, and of his wretched brood and offspring, the beast, to whom he has given his power; here the saints and followers of Christ have been sorely afflicted and persecuted, and yet have held fast the name of Christ, and not denied his faith; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>; the wilderness is the habitation of dragons; and this is the name of the place where the church is said to be in the times of the Papacy, and where she is fed and preserved for a time, and times, and half a time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>; <p>and covered us with the shadow of death; as the former phrase denotes the cruelty of the enemies of Christ's church and people, this their dismal afflictions and forlorn state and condition; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; and may have some respect to the darkness of Popery, when it was at the height, and the church of Christ was covered with it, there being very little appearances and breakings forth of Gospel light any where. According to Arama, the "place of dragons" denotes the captivity of Egypt, which is the great dragon; and the "shadow of death", he says, was a name of Egypt in ancient times, as say the Rabbins; and observes that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a> explains this; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/44.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/44.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">Though</span> &c.] Comp. the vigorous paraphrase of P.B.V.; <span class="ital">No, not when thou hast smitten us</span> &c. But it is better to render<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That thou shouldest have crushed us into a haunt of jackals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Psalmist’s argument is that there has been no national apostasy for which their present disasters would be a just punishment. <span class="ital">A haunt of jackals</span> is a proverbial expression for a scene of ruin and desolation, a waste, howling wilderness, tenanted only by wild beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-22.htm" title="And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.">Isaiah 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm" title="And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm" title="And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.">Jeremiah 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-22.htm" title="Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.">Jeremiah 10:22</a>). Some commentators (on the hypothesis of the Maccabaean date) see a reference to the butchery of the Jews who had fled into the wilderness to escape from the persecution of Antiochus (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-27.htm" title="And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me....">1Ma 2:27-38</a>). But more probably the phrase is a condensed expression, meaning ‘crushed us and reduced our country to a desert.’ There is some doubt however about the reading. The Sept. has, ‘humbled us in a place <span class="ital">of affliction</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the shadow of death</span>] The word <span class="ital">tsalmâveth</span> is rendered thus in the Ancient Versions, and the present vocalisation assumes that this is the meaning. But compounds are rare in Hebrew except in proper names, and there are good grounds for supposing that the word is derived from a different root and should be read <span class="ital">tsalmûth</span>, and rendered <span class="ital">deep gloom</span>. It is however not improbable that the pronunciation of the word was altered at an early date in accordance with a popular etymology.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in the place of jackals</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in wild and desolate regions, where jackals abound (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>).

A distinction is made between the neighbouring nations, or those countries lying immediately round about Israel (&#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as in the exactly similar passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/79-4.htm">Psalm 79:4</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-7.htm">Psalm 80:7</a>, which closely resembles it), and the nations of the earth that dwell farther away from Israel. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is here a jesting, taunting proverb, and one that holds Israel up as an example of a nation undergoing chastisement (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>). The shaking of the head is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>, a gesture of malicious astonishment. In &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>) we have both the permanent aspect or look and the perpetual consciousness. Instead of "shame covers my face," the expression is "the shame of my face covers me," i.e., it has overwhelmed my entire inward and outward being (cf. concerning the radical notions of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-11.htm">Psalm 6:11</a>, and &#1495;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>).
