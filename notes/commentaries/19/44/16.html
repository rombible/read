At such times the people of God will be ready to fear that he has cast them off, and that his name and truth will be dishonoured. But they should look above the instruments of their trouble, to God, well knowing that their worst enemies have no power against them, but what is permitted from above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the voice of him ... - That is, Because I hear the voice of him that reproaches and blasphemes. The word rendered blasphemeth, means properly to use cutting words; then, to reproach or revile. It may be applied either to people or to God. In the former case, it means reproach or reviling; in the latter, blasphemy in the usual sense of that term, denoting reproachful words concerning God. The word may be used here in both these senses, as it is evident that not only were the people the subject of reproach, but that God was also.<p>By reason of the enemy - That is, the foreign enemies, or those who had invaded the land.<p>And avenger - Of him who had come to take vengeance. Here the word refers to the foreign enemies of the nation, and to the spirit by which they were actuated; their purposes to avenge themselves of what they regarded as wrongs, or take vengeance on a nation which they had long hated.

The reproaches of the heathen were most commonly "blasphemies," since they consisted very mainly of contemptuous expressions against the God of Israel (see the comment on ver. 13; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3, 23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By</span> <span class="cmt_word">reason of the enemy and avenger.</span> The persons by whom the blasphemous reproaches were uttered - Israel's enemies bent on avenging former losses and defeats. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 44:10-13) Just as &#1488;&#1507; signifies imo vero (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>) when it comes after an antecedent clause that is expressly or virtually a negative, it may mean "nevertheless, ho'moos," when it opposes a contrastive to an affirmative assertion, as is very frequently the case with &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; or &#1493;&#1490;&#1501;. True, it does not mean this in itself, but in virtue of its logical relation: we praise Thee, we celebrate Thy name unceasingly - also ( equals  nevertheless) Thou hast cast off. From this point the Psalm comes into closest connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39</a>, on a still more extended scale, however, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-12</a>, which dates from the time of the Syro-Ammonitish war, in which Psalm Psa 44:10 recurs almost word for word. The &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; are not exactly standing armies (an objection which has been raised against the Maccabean explanation), they are the hosts of the people that are drafted into battle, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>, the hosts that went forth out of Egypt. Instead of leading these to victory as their victorious Captain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-24.htm">2 Samuel 5:24</a>), God leaves them to themselves and allows them to be smitten by the enemy. The enemy spoil &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, i.e., just as they like, without meeting with any resistance, to their hearts' content. And whilst He gives over (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, and the first &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) one portion of the people as "sheep appointed for food," another becomes a diaspora or dispersion among the heathen, viz., by being sold to them as slaves, and that &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, "for not-riches," i.e., for a very low price, a mere nothing. We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a> in what way this is intended. The form of the litotes is continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-13.htm">Psalm 44:13</a>: Thou didst not go high in the matter of their purchase-money; the rendering of Maurer is correct: in statuendis pretiis eorum. The &#1489; is in this instance not the Beth of the price as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-13.htm">Psalm 44:13</a>, but, as in the phrase &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, the Beth of the sphere and thereby indirectly of the object. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; in the sense of the Aramaic &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a>, and the derivatives &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;), to make a profit, to practise usury (Hupfeld), produces a though that is unworthy of God; vid., on the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>. At the heads of the strophe stands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a>) a perfect with an aorist following: &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1510;&#1488; is consequently a negative &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;. And <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-18.htm">Psalm 44:18</a>, which sums up the whole, shows that all the rest is also intended to be retrospective. </body></html>
