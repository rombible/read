The many victories Israel obtained, were not by their own strength or merit, but by God's favour and free grace. The less praise this allows us, the more comfort it affords, that we may see all as coming from the favour of God. He fought for Israel, else they had fought in vain. This is applicable to the planting of the Christian church in the world, which was not by any human policy or power. Christ, by his Spirit, went forth conquering and to conquer; and he that planted a church for himself in the world, will support it by the same power and goodness. They trusted and triumphed in and through him. Let him that glories, glory in the Lord. But if they have the comfort of his name, let them give unto him the glory due unto it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou art my King, O God - literally, "Thou art He, my King, O God;" that is, Thou art the same: the same King, and the same God, who didst interpose in the time of the fathers, and thou art he whom I recognize as King, as the Sovereign Ruler of thy people. The psalmist here uses the singular number, "my King," as expressive of his own feelings, though he doubtless means also to speak in the name of the people. It would seem not improbable from this, that the author of the psalm was the reigning monarch in the time of the troubles referred to. If not, it was evidently one who personated him, and who meant to represent his feelings. The language shows the strong confidence of the author of the psalm in God, and perhaps also is designed to express his personal responsibility at the time, and his consciousness that his only refuge in conducting the troubled affairs of the nation was God.<p>Command deliverances for Jacob - As if all was under His command, and He had only to give direction, and salvation would come. The word "Jacob" here is used to denote the descendants of Jacob, or the people of God.

Selah.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a><p>"Thou art my King, O God." Knowing right well thy power and grace my heart is glad to own thee for her sovereign prince. Who among the mighty are so illustrious as thou art? To whom, then, should I yield my homage or turn for aid? God of my fathers in the olden time, thou art my soul's monarch and liege Lord. "Command deliverances for Jacob." To whom should a people look but to their king? He it is who, by virtue of his office, fights their battles for them. In the case of our King, how easy it is for him to scatter all our foes! O Lord, the King of kings, with what ease canst thou rescue thy people; a word of thine can do it, give but the command and thy persecuted people shall be free. Jacob's long life was crowded with trials and deliverances, and his descendants are here called by his name, as if to typify the similarity of their experience to that of their great forefather. He who would win the blessings of Israel must share the sorrows of Jacob. This verse contains a personal declaration and an intercessory prayer; those can pray best who make most sure of their personal interest in God, and those who have the fullest assurance that the Lord is their God should be the foremost to plead for the rest of the tried family of the faithful.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a><p>"Through thee will we push down our enemies." The fight was very close, bows were of no avail, and swords failed to be of service, it came to daggers drawing, and hand to hand wrestling, pushing and tugging. Jacob's God was renewing in the seed of Jacob their father's wrestling. And how fared it with faith then? Could she stand foot to foot with her foe and hold her own? Yea, verily, she came forth victorious from the encounter, for she is great at a close push, and overthrows all her adversaries, the Lord being her helper.<p>"Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us." The Lord's name served instead of weapons, and enabled those who used it to leap on their foes and crush them with jubilant valour. In union and communion with God, saints work wonders; if God be for us, who can be against us? Mark well that all the conquests of these believers are said to be "through thee," "through thy name:" never let us forget this, lest going a warfare at our own charges, we fail most ignominiously. Let us not, however, fall into the equally dangerous sin of distrust, for the Lord can make the weakest of us equal to any emergency. Though today we are timid and defenceless as sheep, he can by his power make us strong as the firstling of his bullock, and cause us to push as with the horns of unicorns, until those who rose up against us shall be so crushed and battered as never to rise again. Those who of themselves can scarcely keep their feet, but like little babes totter and fall, are by divine assistance made to overthrow their foes, and set their feet upon their necks. Read Christian's fight with Apollyon, and see how<p>"The man so bravely played the man<p>He made the fiend to fly."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6</a><p>"For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me." Thy people Israel, under thy guidance, shouldered out the heathen, and gained their land, not by skill of weapons or prowess of arms, but by thy power alone; therefore will we renounce for ever all reliance upon outward confidences, of which other men make such boast, and we will cast ourselves upon the omnipotence of our God. Bows having been newly introduced by king Saul, were regarded as very formidable weapons in the early history of Israel, but they are here laid aside together with the all-conquering sword, in order that there may be room for faith in the living God. This verse, in the first person singular, may serve as the confession of faith of every believer renouncing his own righteousness and strength, and looking alone to the Lord Jesus. O for grace to stand to this self-renunciation, for, alas! our proud nature is all too apt to fix its trust on the puffed-up and supposititious power of the creature. Arm of flesh, how dare I trust thee? How dare I bring upon myself the curse of those who rely upon a man?<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/44.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My King; </span> Jacob’s or Israel’s King, in a peculiar manner.

The second prayer runs: vindica me a gente impia; &#1502;&#1503; standing for contra in consequence of a constr. praegnans. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491; is here equivalent to one practising no &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; towards men, that is to say, one totally wanting in that &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, by which God's &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; is to be imitated and repaid by man in his conduct towards his fellow-men. There is some uncertainty whether by &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; one chief enemy, the leader of all the rest, is intended to be mentioned side by side with the unloving nation, or whether the special manner of his enemies is thus merely individualised. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; means roguish, mischievous conduct, utterly devoid of all sense of right. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a> the poet establishes his petition by a twofold Why. He loves God and longs after Him, but in the mirror of his present condition he seems to himself like one cast off by Him. This contradiction between his own consciousness and the inference which he is obliged to draw from his afflicted state cannot remain unsolved. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, God of my fortress, is equivalent to who is my fortress. Instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1498; we here have the form &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, of the slow deliberate gait of one who is lost in his own thoughts and feelings. The sting of his pain is his distance from the sanctuary of his God. In connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a> one is reminded of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>, quite as much as of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>. "Light and truth" is equivalent to mercy and truth. What is intended is the light of mercy or loving-kindness which is coupled with the truth of fidelity to the promises; the light, in which the will or purpose of love, which is God's most especial nature, becomes outwardly manifest. The poet wishes to be guided by these two angels of God; he desires that he may be brought (according tot he Chethb of the Babylonian text &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, "let come upon me;" but the &#1488;&#1500; which follows does not suit this form) to the place where his God dwells and reveals Himself. "Tabernacles" is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, an amplificative designation of the tent, magnificent in itself and raised to special honour by Him who dwells therein. </body></html>
