The many complete victories which Israel obtained over the Canaanites, under the command of Joshua, were not to be attributed to themselves; nor could they claim the glory of them. They were neither owing to their own merit nor their own light, but to God’s favour and power engaged for them; without which all their own efforts and endeavours would have been fruitless.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/44.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>44:1-8 Former experiences of God's power and goodness are strong supports to faith, and powerful pleas in prayer under present calamities. The many victories Israel obtained, were not by their own strength or merit, but by God's favour and free grace. The less praise this allows us, the more comfort it affords, that we may see all as coming from the favour of God. He fought for Israel, else they had fought in vain. This is applicable to the planting of the Christian church in the world, which was not by any human policy or power. Christ, by his Spirit, went forth conquering and to conquer; and he that planted a church for himself in the world, will support it by the same power and goodness. They trusted and triumphed in and through him. Let him that glories, glory in the Lord. But if they have the comfort of his name, let them give unto him the glory due unto it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand - The word rendered "heathen" means simply nations without necessarily conveying the idea of paganism, as that word is now understood. It means the nations, to wit, of the land of Canaan, or the Canaanites; and as these nations were in fact idolaters, or strangers to the true religion, the word came in time to have that idea attached to it. It is in that sense that we use the term now, though the word nations would accurately express the meaning of the original. The word rendered "drive out" - &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;  ya&#770;rash - means properly to take, seize, or take possession of; and then, in the form here used (Hiphil), it means to cause to possess; to give possession of; and then, to take possession of, to drive out of a possession, to dispossess, to disinherit. The meaning here is, he dispossessed them of their country; he disinherited them. This, the psalmist says, God had done "by his hand;" that is, it was by his own power.<p>And plantedst them - That is, planted his people - the children of Israel. He put them in the place of those whom he had disinherited or dispossessed. The word is properly applicable to a tree, but it is also used with reference to a nation, and means that he assigned them a fixed and permanent residence. Thus we say in English, "to plant a colony." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-15.htm">Amos 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a>.<p>How thou didst afflict the people - That is, the people of the land of Canaan; the nations that dwelt there. The word means to bring evil or calamity upon anyone.<p>And cast them out - The word used here may be taken in the sense of sending out or expelling, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-7.htm">1 Kings 9:7</a> - and then it would be applicable to the Canaanites, as meaning that God had expelled or driven them out - as it is understood by our translators; or it may be used to denote the sending out of shoots or branches by a tree or vine, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-11.htm">Psalm 80:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6-7</a> - and then it would refer here to the Israelites, and would mean that God caused them to increase; multiplied them; spread them over the land, as a vine spreads, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-11</a>. The parallelism here clearly demands the latter interpretation. So it is understood by Luther, DeWette, Tholuck, and Prof. Alexander. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. plantedst them&#8212;that is, "our fathers," who are also, from the parallel construction of the last clause, to be regarded as the object of "cast them out," which means&#8212;literally, "send" them out, or, "extend them." Heathen and people denote the nations who were driven out to make room for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/44.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The heathen; </span> the Canaanites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Plantedst them, </span> to wit, our fathers, easily understood both from the matter, and from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-1.htm" title="We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the times of old.">Psalm 44:1</a></span>, where they are expressed; the pronoun being referred unto the remoter antecedent, as it is <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-12.htm" title="And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.">Genesis 10:12</a> 19:13 <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm" title="The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.">Psalm 18:5</a></span>, and oft elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cast them out:</span> so <span class="ital">them</span> must be <span class="ital">the people</span>, or heathens. But because the comparing of this branch of the verse with the former, <span class="ital">plantedst them</span>, to which this answers, and with the following <span class="ital">they</span>, makes it more than probable that this <span class="ital">them</span> belongs to the fathers, this is to be otherwise rendered; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Thus, <span class="ital">send them out</span>, to wit, free or manumitted out of Egypt, of which this same verb is used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm" title="And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.">Exodus 5:1</a> 12:33</span>. And then the foregoing <span class="ital">people</span> are the Egyptians, not the Canaanites; which yet seems not to agree with the foregoing and following passages both which speak of the Canaanites only; nor with the order of the words in this verse, it being improper to mention their coming out of Egypt, after their being planted in Canaan. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Thus, <span class="ital">make them send or shoot forth</span>, to wit, <span class="ital">branches</span>, as it is more fully expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-11.htm" title="She sent out her boughs to the sea, and her branches to the river.">Psalm 80:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-6.htm" title="And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.">Ezekiel 17:6</a></span>, where this verb is used.

The metaphor of <span class="ital">planting</span> is frequently applied to the establishment of Israel in Canaan (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm" title="You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.">Exodus 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,">2 Samuel 7:10</a>), and it is continued in the next line, where the rendering cause them to spread abroad is commended by the usage of the word and by the parallelism. Israel is compared to a tree which struck root and spread its branches far and wide.

The second prayer runs: vindica me a gente impia; &#1502;&#1503; standing for contra in consequence of a constr. praegnans. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491; is here equivalent to one practising no &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; towards men, that is to say, one totally wanting in that &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, by which God's &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; is to be imitated and repaid by man in his conduct towards his fellow-men. There is some uncertainty whether by &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; one chief enemy, the leader of all the rest, is intended to be mentioned side by side with the unloving nation, or whether the special manner of his enemies is thus merely individualised. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; means roguish, mischievous conduct, utterly devoid of all sense of right. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a> the poet establishes his petition by a twofold Why. He loves God and longs after Him, but in the mirror of his present condition he seems to himself like one cast off by Him. This contradiction between his own consciousness and the inference which he is obliged to draw from his afflicted state cannot remain unsolved. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, God of my fortress, is equivalent to who is my fortress. Instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1498; we here have the form &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, of the slow deliberate gait of one who is lost in his own thoughts and feelings. The sting of his pain is his distance from the sanctuary of his God. In connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a> one is reminded of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>, quite as much as of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>. "Light and truth" is equivalent to mercy and truth. What is intended is the light of mercy or loving-kindness which is coupled with the truth of fidelity to the promises; the light, in which the will or purpose of love, which is God's most especial nature, becomes outwardly manifest. The poet wishes to be guided by these two angels of God; he desires that he may be brought (according tot he Chethb of the Babylonian text &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, "let come upon me;" but the &#1488;&#1500; which follows does not suit this form) to the place where his God dwells and reveals Himself. "Tabernacles" is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, an amplificative designation of the tent, magnificent in itself and raised to special honour by Him who dwells therein. </body></html>
