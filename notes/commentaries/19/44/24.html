Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, and must be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, therefore judges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive us from our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from our comfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not render us careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on by persecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back from God. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered unto death, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, ver. 25,26. Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner's pleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one of them shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased, promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, does away every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeem us for thy mercies' sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore hidest thou thy face? - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-1.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>. Why dost thou turn away from us, and refuse to aid us, and leave us to these unpitied sufferings?<p>And forgettest our affliction and our oppression - Our trials, and the wrongs that are committed against us. These are earnest appeals. They are the pleadings of the oppressed and the wronged. The language is such as man would use in addressing his fellow-men; and, when applied to God, it must be understood as such language. As used in the Psalms, it denotes earnestness, but not irreverence; it is solemn petition, not dictation; it is affectionate pleading, not complaint. It indicates depth of suffering and distress, and is the strongest language which could be employed to denote entire helplessness and dependence. At the same time, it is language which implies that the cause for which they suffered was the cause of God, and that they might properly call on him to interfere in behalf of his own friends. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-26. This style of addressing God, as indifferent, is frequent (Ps 3:7; 9:19; 13:1, &c.). However low their condition, God is appealed to, on the ground, and for the honor, of His mercy.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/44.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hidest thou thy face, </span> i.e. dost not regard our miseries, nor affordest us any pity or help. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Forgettest our affliction and our oppression, </span> when we have not forgotten thee.

Not that the Lord does really forget either the persons of his people, which he cannot, since they are engraven on the palms of his hands, and a book of remembrance is written for them: nor the afflictions of his people; he knows their souls in adversity; he chooses them in the furnace of affliction; he makes all afflictions work together for good, and delivers out of them. But because deliverance is not immediately wrought, and they sometimes continue long under their afflictions and oppressions, they seem to be forgotten by him, as during the ten persecutions and the long reign of antichrist. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/44.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/44.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">hidest thou thy face</span>] In anger or indifference, instead of shewing the light of Thy countenance in gracious help to Thy people (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm" title="For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, because you had a favor to them.">Psalm 44:3</a></span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm" title="Turn us again, O God, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved.">Psalm 80:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our affliction and our oppression</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-7.htm" title="And when we cried to the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labor, and our oppression:">Deuteronomy 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm" title="And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-9.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.">Exodus 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm" title="And Jehoahaz sought the LORD, and the LORD listened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.">2 Kings 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-26.htm" title="For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.">2 Kings 14:26</a>.

This is therefore not one of the many instances in which the &#1500;&#1488; of one clause also has influence over the clause that follows (Ges. 152, 3). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-20.htm">Psalm 44:20</a>, has the sense of quod: we have not revolted against Thee, that Thou shouldest on that account have done to us the thing which is now befallen us.
