The many victories Israel obtained, were not by their own strength or merit, but by God's favour and free grace. The less praise this allows us, the more comfort it affords, that we may see all as coming from the favour of God. He fought for Israel, else they had fought in vain. This is applicable to the planting of the Christian church in the world, which was not by any human policy or power. Christ, by his Spirit, went forth conquering and to conquer; and he that planted a church for himself in the world, will support it by the same power and goodness. They trusted and triumphed in and through him. Let him that glories, glory in the Lord. But if they have the comfort of his name, let them give unto him the glory due unto it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Through thee - By thy help.

The Chaldee paraphrase renders it, "through the Word": the essential Word of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the church's King and God, and has wrought out complete deliverance and salvation for his people; and he is the horn of salvation, by which, though weak in themselves, they push down their enemies, which are many and mighty, and they are more than conquerors over them: the metaphor is taken from creatures pushing with their horns those that oppose them, and in defence of themselves; and there seems to be an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <p>through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us; in the name of the Lord the saints set up their banners, and in his name they come forth and fight with their spiritual enemies, that rise up against them, as sin, Satan, and wicked men; and in the name, and through the power of the Lord, they tread them down as mire in the streets; and before long Satan will be wholly bruised under them; and the antichristian party shall be trodden down by them, and be as ashes under the soles of their feet; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/44.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{h}</span> Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</span><p>(h) Because they and their forefathers made both one Church, they apply that to themselves which before they attributed to their fathers.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/44.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">push down</span>) Perhaps a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm" title="His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; but metaphors from horned animals are common.

The cohortatives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a> are, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-14.htm">Psalm 39:14</a> and frequently, an apodosis to the petition. The poet knows no joy like that which proceeds from God, and the joy which proceeds from Him he accounts as the very highest; hence he calls God &#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;, and therefore he knows no higher aim for his longing than again to be where the fountainhead of this exultant joy is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-5.htm">Hosea 9:5</a>), and where it flows forth in streams (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>). Removed back thither, he will give thanks to Him with the cithern (Beth instrum.). He calls Him &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, an expression which, in the Elohim-Psalms, is equivalent to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; in the Jahve-Psalms. The hope expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a> casts its rays into the prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/43-5.htm">Psalm 43:5</a>, the spirit having taken courage in God, holds this picture drawn by hope before the distressed soul, that she may therewith comfort herself. Instead of wthmy, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>, the expression here used, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-12.htm">Psalm 42:12</a>, is &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;. Variations like these are not opposed to a unity of authorship. </body></html>
