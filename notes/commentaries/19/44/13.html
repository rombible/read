At such times the people of God will be ready to fear that he has cast them off, and that his name and truth will be dishonoured. But they should look above the instruments of their trouble, to God, well knowing that their worst enemies have no power against them, but what is permitted from above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-8.htm">Psalm 39:8</a>. The word neighbors here refers to surrounding people or nations. They were reproached, scorned, and derided as forsaken by God, and given up to their foes. They no longer commanded the admiration of mankind as a prosperous, favored, happy people. Surrounding nations treated them with contempt as inspiring no fear, and as having nothing to entitle them to respect. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14.

May He therefore, by virtue of His duty as king which He has voluntarily taken upon Himself, and of the kingly authority and power indwelling in Him, command the salvation of Jacob, full and entire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-51.htm">Psalm 18:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-7.htm">Psalm 53:7</a>). &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>. Jacob is used for Israel just as Elohim is used instead of Jahve. If Elohim, Jacob's King, now turns graciously to His people, they will again be victorious and invincible, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6</a> affirms. &#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1495; with reference to &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; as a figure and emblem of strength, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-25.htm">Psalm 89:25</a> and frequently; &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; equivalent to &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. But only in the strength of God (&#1489;&#1468;&#1498; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>); for not in my bow do I trust, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-7.htm">Psalm 44:7</a>. This teaching Israel has gathered from the history of the former times; there is no bidding defiance with the bow and sword and all the carnal weapons of attack, but Thou, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-8.htm">Psalm 44:8</a>. This "Thou" in &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is the emphatic word; the preterites describe facts of experience belonging to history. It is not Israel's own might that gives them the supremacy, but God's gracious might in Israel's weakness. Elohim is, therefore, Israel's glory or pride: "In Elohim do we praise," i.e., we glory or make our boast in Him; cf. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a>. The music here joins in after the manner of a hymn. The Psalm here soars aloft to the more joyous height of praise, from which it now falls abruptly into bitter complaint. </body></html>
