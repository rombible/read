Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, and must be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, therefore judges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive us from our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from our comfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not render us careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on by persecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back from God. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered unto death, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, ver. 25,26. Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner's pleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one of them shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased, promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, does away every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeem us for thy mercies' sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/44.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For our soul is bowed down to the dust - That is, We are overborne with calamity, so that we sink to the earth.

This is therefore not one of the many instances in which the &#1500;&#1488; of one clause also has influence over the clause that follows (Ges. 152, 3). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-20.htm">Psalm 44:20</a>, has the sense of quod: we have not revolted against Thee, that Thou shouldest on that account have done to us the thing which is now befallen us. Concerning &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>. A "place of jackals" is, like a habitation of dragons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>), the most lonesome and terrible wilderness; the place chosen was, according to this, an inhospitable &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, far removed from the dwellings of men. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; is construed with &#1506;&#1500; of the person covered, and with &#1489;&#1468; of that with which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>) he is covered: Thou coveredst us over with deepest darkness (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>). &#1488;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-21.htm">Psalm 44:21</a>, is not that of asseveration (verily we have not forgotten), but, as the interrogatory apodosis <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-22.htm">Psalm 44:22</a> shows, conditional: if we have ( equals  should have) forgotten. This would not remain hidden from Him who knoweth the heart, for the secrets of men's hearts are known to Him.
