Literally, "all the day my shame is before me." That is, the evidences of disgrace, defeat, and disaster; render everywhere around him, and he could not conceal them from himself. The psalmist here is represented as the head of the people, and expresses the sense of disgrace which the sovereign era people would feel in a time of national calamity; identifying himself with the people, he speaks of the national disgrace as his own.<p>And the shame of my face - The shame that is manifested on the countenance when we blush.<p>Hath covered me - That is, I am suffused with the evidence of my shame; or, as we sometimes say, "he blushed all over." The blush, however - that special rush of blood manifesting itself through the skin - which constitutes the evidence of shame, is confined to the face and the neck; an arrangement which none can explain, except on the supposition that there is a God; that he is a moral governor; and that, as it was designed that the body should be covered or clothed, he meant that the evidence of guilt should manifest itself on the parts of the person which are most exposed to view, or where others could see it. The idea here is, that he could not conceal the proofs of his shame and disgrace; he was compelled to exhibit them to all around. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/44.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. shame of &#8230; face&#8212;blushes in disgrace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/44.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Before me; </span> before the eyes of my mind and body too.

True, it does not mean this in itself, but in virtue of its logical relation: we praise Thee, we celebrate Thy name unceasingly - also ( equals  nevertheless) Thou hast cast off. From this point the Psalm comes into closest connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39</a>, on a still more extended scale, however, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-12</a>, which dates from the time of the Syro-Ammonitish war, in which Psalm Psa 44:10 recurs almost word for word. The &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; are not exactly standing armies (an objection which has been raised against the Maccabean explanation), they are the hosts of the people that are drafted into battle, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>, the hosts that went forth out of Egypt. Instead of leading these to victory as their victorious Captain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-24.htm">2 Samuel 5:24</a>), God leaves them to themselves and allows them to be smitten by the enemy. The enemy spoil &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, i.e., just as they like, without meeting with any resistance, to their hearts' content. And whilst He gives over (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, and the first &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) one portion of the people as "sheep appointed for food," another becomes a diaspora or dispersion among the heathen, viz., by being sold to them as slaves, and that &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, "for not-riches," i.e., for a very low price, a mere nothing. We see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a> in what way this is intended. The form of the litotes is continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-13.htm">Psalm 44:13</a>: Thou didst not go high in the matter of their purchase-money; the rendering of Maurer is correct: in statuendis pretiis eorum. The &#1489; is in this instance not the Beth of the price as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-13.htm">Psalm 44:13</a>, but, as in the phrase &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, the Beth of the sphere and thereby indirectly of the object. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; in the sense of the Aramaic &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a>, and the derivatives &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;), to make a profit, to practise usury (Hupfeld), produces a though that is unworthy of God; vid., on the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>. At the heads of the strophe stands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a>) a perfect with an aorist following: &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1510;&#1488; is consequently a negative &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;. And <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-18.htm">Psalm 44:18</a>, which sums up the whole, shows that all the rest is also intended to be retrospective. </body></html>
