The bank of a river, like the seashore, is a favourite place of sojourn of those whom deep grief drives forth from the bustle of men into solitude. The boundary line of the river gives to solitude a safe back; the monotonous splashing of the waves keeps up the dull, melancholy alternation of thoughts and feelings; and at the same time the sight of the cool, fresh water exercises a soothing influence upon the consuming fever within the heart. The rivers of Babylon are here those of the Babylonian empire: not merely the Euphrates with its canals, and the Tigris, but also the Chaboras (Chebar) and Eulaeos ('Ulai), on whose lonesome banks Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>) and Daniel (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>) beheld divine visions. The &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is important: there, in a strange land, as captives under the dominion of the power of the world. And &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; is purposely chosen instead of &#1493;: with the sitting down in the solitude of the river's banks weeping immediately came on; when the natural scenery around contrasted so strongly with that of their native land, the remembrance of Zion only forced itself upon them all the more powerfully, and the pain at the isolation from their home would have all the freer course where no hostilely observant eyes were present to suppress it. The willow (&#1510;&#1508;&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;) and viburnum, those trees which are associated with flowing water in hot low-lying districts, are indigenous in the richly watered lowlands of Babylonia. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; (&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;), if one and the same with Arab. grb, is not the willow, least of all the weeping-willow, which is called s&#803;afsa&#770;f mustah&#305;&#770; in Arabic, "the bending-down willow," but the viburnum with dentate leaves, described by Wetzstein on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>. The Talmud even distinguishes between tsaph-tsapha and &#8219;araba, but without our being able to obtain any sure botanic picture from it. The &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, whose branches belong to the constituents of the lulab of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>), is understood of the crack-willow [Salix fragilis], and even in the passage before us is surely not distinguished with such botanical precision but that the gharab and willow together with the weeping-willow (Salix Babylonica) might be comprehended under the word &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;. On these trees of the country abounding in streams the exiles hung their citherns. The time to take delight in music was past, for &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, Sir. 22:6. Joyous songs, as the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; designates them, were ill suited to their situation.<p>In order to understand the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-4.htm">Psalm 137:4</a> must be taken together. They hung up their citherns; for though their lords called upon them to sing in order that they might divert themselves with their national songs, they did not feel themselves in the mind for singing songs as they once resounded at the divine services of their native land. The lxx, Targum, and Syriac take &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; as a synonym of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, synonymous with &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, and so, in fact, that it signifies not, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, the spoiled and captive one, but the spoiler and he who takes other prisoners. But there is no Aramaic &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;. It might more readily be referred back to a Poel &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; ( equals  &#1492;&#1514;&#1500;), to disappoint, deride (Hitzig); but the usage of the language does not favour this, and a stronger meaning for the word would be welcome. Either &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, like &#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a>, signifies the raving one, i.e., a bloodthirsty man or a tyrant, or from &#1497;&#1500;&#1500;, ejulare, one who causes the cry of woe or a tormentor, - a signification which commends itself in view of the words &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, which are likewise formed with the preformative &#1514;. According to the sense the word ranks itself with an Hiph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;, with &#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495;, in a mainly abstract signification (Dietrich, Abhandlungen, S. 160f.). The &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; beside &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; is used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm">Psalm 105:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, viz., partitively, dividing up the genitival notion of the species: words of songs as being parts or fragments of the national treasury of song, similar to &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; a little further on, on which Rosenmller correctly says: sacrum aliquod carmen ex veteribus illis suis Sionicis. With the expression "song of Zion" alternates in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-4.htm">Psalm 137:4</a> "song of Jahve," which, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-27.htm">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7</a>, denotes sacred or liturgical songs, that is to say, songs belonging to Psalm poesy (including the Cantica).<p>Before <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-4.htm">Psalm 137:4</a> we have to imagine that they answered the request of the Babylonians at that time in the language that follows, or thought thus within themselves when they withdrew themselves from them. The meaning of the interrogatory exclamation is not that the singing of sacred songs in a foreign land (&#1495;&#1493;&#1510;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;) is contrary to the law, for the Psalms continued to be sung even during the Exile, and were also enriched by new ones. But the shir had an end during the Exile, in so far as that it was obliged to retire from publicity into the quiet of the family worship and of the houses of prayer, in order that that which is holy might not be profaned; and since it was not, as at home, accompanied by the trumpets of the priests and the music of the Levites, it became more recitative than singing properly so called, and therefore could not afford any idea of the singing of their native land in connection with the worship of God on Zion. From the striking contrast between the present and the former times the people of the Exile had in fact to come to the knowledge of their sins, in order that they might get back by the way of penitence and earnest longing to that which they had lost Penitence and home-sickness were at that time inseparable; for all those in whom the remembrance of Zion was lost gave themselves over to heathenism and were excluded from the redemption. The poet, translated into the situation of the exiles, and arming himself against the temptation to apostasy and the danger of denying God, therefore says: If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; has been taken as an address to Jahve: obliviscaris dexterae meae (e.g., Wolfgang Dachstein in his song "An Wasserflssen Babylon"), but it is far from natural that Jerusalem and Jahve should be addressed in one clause. Others take &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; as the subject and &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; transitively: obliviscatur dextera mea, scil. artem psallendi (Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, Pagninus, Grotius, Hengstenberg, and others); but this ellipsis is arbitrary, and the interpolation of &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; after &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (von Ortenberg, following Olshausen) produces an inelegant cadence. Others again assign a passive sense to &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495;: oblivioni detur (lxx, Italic, Vulgate, and Luther), or a half-passive sense, in oblivione sit (Jerome); but the thought: let my right hand be forgotten, is awkward and tame. Obliviscatur me (Syriac, Saadia, and the Psalterium Romanum) comes nearer to the true meaning. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495; is to be taken reflexively: obliviscatur sui ipsius, let it forget itself, or its service (Amyraldus, Schultens, Ewald, and Hitzig), which is equivalent to let it refuse or fail, become lame, become benumbed, much the same as we say of the arms of legs that they "go to sleep," and just as the Arabic nasiya signifies both to forget and to become lame (cf. Gesenius, Thesaurus, p. 921b). La Harpe correctly renders: O Jerusalem! si je t'oublie jamais, que ma main oublie aussi le mouvement! Thus there is a correspondence between <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-6.htm">Psalm 137:6</a> : My tongue shall cleave to my palate if I do not remember thee, if I do not raise Jerusalem above the sum of my joy. &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; has the affixed Chirek, with which these later Psalms are so fond of adorning themselves. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is apparently used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a> : supra summam (the totality) laetitiae meae, as Coccejus explains, h.e. supra omnem laetitiam meam. But why not then more simply &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, above the totality? &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; here signifies not &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, but &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;: if I do not place Jerusalem upon the summit of my joy, i.e., my highest joy; therefore, if I do not cause Jerusalem to be my very highest joy. His spiritual joy over the city of God is to soar above all earthly joys. </body></html>
