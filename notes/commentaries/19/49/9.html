A man may have wealth, and may have his heart enlarged in love, thankfulness, and obedience, and may do good with it. Therefore it is not men's having riches that proves them to be worldly, but their setting their hearts upon them as the best things. Worldly men have only some floating thoughts of the things of God, while their fixed thoughts, their inward thoughts, are about the world; that lies nearest the heart. But with all their wealth they cannot save the life of the dearest friend they have. This looks further, to the eternal redemption to be wrought out by the Messiah. The redemption of the soul shall cost very dear; but, being once wrought, it shall never need to be repeated. And he, the Redeemer, shall rise again before he sees corruption, and then shall live for evermore, Re 1:18. This likewise shows the folly of worldly people, who sell their souls for that which will never buy them. With all their wealth they cannot secure themselves from the stroke of death. Yet one generation after another applaud their maxims; and the character of a fool, as drawn by heavenly Wisdom itself, Lu 12:16-21, continues to be followed even among professed Christians. Death will ask the proud sinner, Where is thy wealth, thy pomp? And in the morning of the resurrection, when all that sleep in the dust shall awake, the upright shall be advanced to the highest honour, when the wicked shall be filled with everlasting shame and contempt, Da 12:2. Let us now judge of things as they will appear in that day. The beauty of holiness is that alone which the grave cannot touch, or damage.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That he should still live for ever - That his brother whom he could not redeem - or that he himself - should not die, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>.

Or the meaning is, he cannot so redeem his brother, or give to God a ransom for him, that he should live a corporeal life for ever, and never die; since all men die, wise men and fools, rich and poor; and much less that he should live and enjoy an "eternal life", as the Targum; a life of happiness and bliss hereafter, which is not to be obtained by gold and silver, but is the pure gift of God; <p>and not see corruption; the grave, the pit of corruption, the house appointed for all living: or "the judgment of hell", according to the Chaldee paraphrase. <p>(w) "etiamsi vivat", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/49.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/49.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>.

Very similarly do the elder (in the reign of Jehoshaphat) and the younger Micha (Micah) introduce their prophecies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>); and Elihu in the Book of Job his didactic discourses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34-2.htm">Psalm 34:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>). It is an universal theme which the poet intends to take up, hence he calls upon all peoples and all the inhabitants of the &#1495;&#1500;&#1491;. Such is the word first of all for this temporal life, which glides by unnoticed, them for the present transitory world itself (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>). It is his intention to declare to the rich the utter nothingness or vanity of their false ground of hope, and to the poor the superiority of their true ground of hope; hence he wishes to have as hearers both &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, children of the common people, who are men and have otherwise nothing distinctive about them, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, children of men, i.e., of rank and distinction (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>) - rich and poor, as he adds to make his meaning more clear. For his mouth will, or shall, utter &#1492;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, not: all sorts of wise teachings, but: weighty wisdom. Just in like manner &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; signifies profound insight or understanding; cf. plurals like &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-11.htm">Isaiah 27:11</a>, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-12.htm">Psalm 42:12</a> and frequently, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-21.htm">Jeremiah 22:21</a>. The parallel word &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in the passage before us, and the plural predicate in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-7.htm">Proverbs 24:7</a>, show that &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>, is not to be regarded, with Hitzig, Olshausen, and others, as another form of the singular &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;.

What he intends to discourse is, however, not the creation of his own brain, but what he has received. A &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, a saying embodying the wisdom of practical life, as God teaches men it, presents itself to his mind demanding to be heard; and to this he inclines his ear in order that, from being a diligent scholar of the wisdom from above, he may become a useful teacher of men, inasmuch as he opens up, i.e., unravels, the divine Mashal, which in the depth and fulness of its contents is a &#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, i.e., an involved riddle (from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, cogn. &#1488;&#1490;&#1491;, &#1506;&#1511;&#1491;), and plays the cithern thereby (&#1489; of the accompaniment). The opening of the riddle does not consist in the solving of it, but in the setting of it forth. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, to open  equals  to propound, deliver of a discourse, comes from the phrase &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;-&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-26.htm">Proverbs 31:26</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-130.htm">Psalm 119:130</a>, where &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, an opening, is equivalent to an unlocking, a revelation. </body></html>
