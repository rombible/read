God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Such were the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/118.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is on my side - Margin, as in Hebrew," for me."

Or "for me" (s); he was on the side of David, hence all his prosperity and victories, the wonderful things done by him, his exaltation to the throne, and the establishment of it; and so he was on the side of Christ, he was near unto him, at his right hand, to guide, direct, and assist him as man; and he is likewise on the side of his people, to fight their battles for them, to support them under all their afflictions, to supply all their wants, to deliver them from all evil, to carry on the work of grace in their souls, and to bring them to glory, The Targum is, <p>"the Word of the Lord is for my help.'' <p>I will not fear: what can man do unto me?

Nor have the saints any reason to fear what man can do unto them, when grace is in exercise; for what is man to God, who is but flesh, and that flesh grass? Nor can he do anything without a divine permission; is often frustrated in his attempt; and what he is suffered to do is overruled for good; and the utmost he can do is to kill the body; he cannot destroy the soul, or hinder the happiness of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-4.htm">Psalm 56:4</a>. <p>(s) "pro me", Musculus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/118.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD <i>is</i> on my side; I will not fear: what can <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> man do unto me?</span><p>(c) Being exalted to this estate, he assured himself to have man ever to be his enemy.

In its very brevity it is one of the grandest witnesses of the might with which, in the midst of the Old Testament, the world-wide mission of the religion of revelation struck against or undermined the national limitation. It is stamped by the apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-11.htm">Romans 15:11</a> as a locus classicus for the fore-ordained (gnadenrathschlussmssig) participation of the heathen in the promised salvation of Israel.<p>Even this shortest Psalm has its peculiarities in point of language. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (Aramaic &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;, Arabic umam) is otherwise alien to Old Testament Hebrew.

The call is confirmed from the might of the mercy or loving-kindness of Jahve, which proves itself mighty over Israel, i.e., by its intensity and fulness superabundantly covering (&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-11.htm">Psalm 103:11</a>; cf. &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-14.htm">1 Timothy 1:14</a>) human sin and infirmity; and from His truth, by virtue of which history on into eternity ends in a verifying of His promises.
