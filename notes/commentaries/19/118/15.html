Indeed, it is not worth while to live for any other purpose than to declare the works of God, for his honour, and the encouragement of others to serve and trust in him. Such as these were the triumphs of the Son of David; in the assurance he had of the success of his undertaking, and that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hands.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/118.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>118:1-18 The account the psalmist here gives of his troubles is very applicable to Christ: many hated him without a cause; nay, the Lord himself chastened him sorely, bruised him, and put him to grief, that by his stripes we might be healed. God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him.

Luther renders this beautifully; "They sing with joy for victory in the houses of the righteous."<p>Is in the tabernacles of the righteous - The tents of the righteous; their dwellings. That is,<p>(a) it is a fact that the voice of joy and rejoicing is there;<p>(b) it is appropriate that it should be so, or that a righteous family should be happy - the dwelling-place of praise;<p>(c) God will add to the happiness of the righteous, or will make their habitation happy, peaceful, blessed.<p>There is nothing that diffuses so much happiness through a family as religion; there is no joy like that when a member of a family is converted; there is no place on earth more happy than that where a family bows before God with the feeling that all are children of God and heirs of salvation.<p>The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly - Hebrew "Doeth strength."

In all the dwellings of good men, throughout the land of Israel, was heard nothing but the voice of joy, on account of David's accession to the throne; the deliverance of him from a persecuting Saul, and of them from his real administration; and the victories David obtained over all his enemies: for, "when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice", <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>. And still much more occasion is there of joy, in the dwelling places of the saints, though but cottages, and in the churches of God, the tabernacles of the most High, on account of the spiritual and eternal salvation Christ is the author of which joy is inwardly felt in the heart, and outwardly expressed by one saint to another; and in vocal prayer to God, and in singing his praises; which may be done in the houses of the saints, as well as in the house of God. What this voice, or the righteous with their voice, expressed in each of their dwelling houses, is as follows; for the word "saying" may be supplied, and the words connected thus: <p>saying, the right hand of the Lord doth valiantly; or "acts powerfully" (b); in helping and assisting David, in protecting and defending him, in raising him to the throne, and in giving him rest from all his enemies; and so in supporting the Messiah, his antitype, as man and Mediator, in his work and under his sufferings; in raising him from the dead, and exalting: him at his right hand; and which was done with his right hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>. Jarchi refers this joy here expressed to future times, the times of the Messiah: and in an ancient (c) writing of the Jews the right hand of the Lord, three times mentioned in this verse and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-16.htm">Psalm 118:16</a>, is interpreted of the Messiah, the sort of David. <p>(b)  "agit strenue", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Cocceius.

It has its advocates even in the Talmud (B.

The Jewish people had experienced this helpful succour of Jahve in opposition to the persecutions of the Samaritans and the satraps during the building of the Temple; and had at the same time learned what is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7-8</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>), that trust in Jahve (for which &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489; is the proper word) proves true, and trust in men, on the contrary, and especially in princes, is deceptive; for under Pseudo-Smerdis the work, begun under Cyrus, and represented as open to suspicion even in the reign of Cambyses, was interdicted. But in the reign of Darius it again became free: Jahve showed that He disposes events and the hearts of men in favour of His people, so that out of this has grown up in the minds of His people the confident expectation of a world-subduing supremacy expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>.<p>The clauses <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>, expressed in the perfect form, are intended more hypothetically than as describing facts.

And in general, as Redslob has demonstrated, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has not originally a relative, but a positive (determining) signification, &#1499; being just as much a demonstrative sound as &#1491;, &#1494;, &#1513;&#1473;, and &#1514; (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;'&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, ecce, hic, illic, with the Doric &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). The notion of compassing round about is heightened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a> by the juxtaposition of two forms of the same verb (Ges. 67, rem. 10), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a>, and frequently.

The Pual points to the punishing power that comes upon them: they are extinguished (exstinguuntur) like a fire of thorns, the crackling flame of which expires as quickly as it has blazed up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a> the language of Israel is addressed to the hostile worldly power, as the antithesis shows. It thrust, yea thrust (inf. intens.)

It is not the part. Pil. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>), since the rejection of the participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not elsewhere with Pilel (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The word yields a simpler sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; rome&#772;ma&#772;&#769;h is only the fuller form for rama&#772;&#769;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (cf. ra&#772;&#769;mah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). It is not its own strength that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true, most severely chastened it (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the suffix anni as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with the emphatic Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>), but still with moderation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>.). He has not suffered Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation, that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the Temple. </body></html>
