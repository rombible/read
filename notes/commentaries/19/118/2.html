God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Such were the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/118.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let Israel now say ... - The Hebrew people; the people of God.

After invoking others to unite in praise, the writer celebrates God's protecting and delivering care towards him, and then represents himself and the people of God as entering the sanctuary and uniting in solemn praise, with prayer for a continued blessing. Whether composed by David on his accession to power, or by some later writer in memory of the restoration from Babylon, its tone is joyful and trusting, and, in describing the fortune and destiny of the Jewish Church and its visible head, it is typically prophetical of the Christian Church and her greater and invisible Head.<p>1-4.

Instead of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; the poet, who is fond of such embellishments, chooses the pathetic form &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;, and consequently, instead of the genitival construct state (&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;), the construction with the Lamed of "belonging to." It ought properly to be "soul" or "blood," as in the primary passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-14.htm">Psalm 72:14</a>. But the observation of Grotius: quae pretiosa sunt, non facile largimur, applies also to the expression "death." The death of His saints is no trifling matter with God; He does not lightly suffer it to come about; He does not suffer His own to be torn away from Him by death.<p>(Note: The Apostolic Constitutions (vi. 30) commend the singing of these and other words of the Psalms at the funerals of those who have departed in the faith (cf. Augusti, Denkwrdigkeiten, ix. 563). In the reign of the Emperor Decius, Babylas Bishop of Antioch, full of blessed hope, met death singing these words.)<p>After this the poet goes on beseechingly: a&#772;nna&#769;h Adonaj. The prayer itself is not contained in &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497; - for he is already rescued, and the perfect as a precative is limited to such utterances spoken in the tone of an exclamation as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-16.htm">Job 21:16</a> - but remains unexpressed; it lies wrapped up as it were in this heartfelt a&#772;nna&#769;h: Oh remain still so gracious to me as Thou hast already proved Thyself to me. The poet rejoices in and is proud of the fact that he may call himself the servant of God. With &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;&#1498; he is mindful of his pious mother (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-16.htm">Psalm 86:16</a>). The Hebrew does not form a feminine, &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;; Arab. amata signifies a maid, who is not, as such, also Arab. &#8219;abdat, a slave. The dative of the object, &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497; (from &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; for the more usual &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), is used with &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514; instead of the accusative after the Aramaic manner, but it does also occur in the older Hebrew (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>). The purpose of publicly giving thanks to the Gracious One is now more full-toned here at the close. Since such emphasis is laid on the Temple and the congregation, what is meant is literal thank-offerings in payment of vows. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1499;&#1497; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-9.htm">Psalm 135:9</a>) we have in the suffix the ancient and Aramaic i((cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-7.htm">Psalm 116:7</a>) for the third time. With &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; the poet clings to Jahve, with &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; to the congregation, and with &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1499;&#1497; to the holy city. The one thought that fills his whole soul, and in which the song which breathes forth his soul dies away, is Hallelujah. </body></html>
