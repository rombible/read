His humiliation; he is the Stone which the builders refused: they would go on in their building without him. This proved the ruin of those who thus made light of him. Rejecters of Christ are rejected of God. 2. His exaltation; he is the chief Cornerstone in the foundation. He is the chief Top-stone, in whom the building is completed, who must, in all things, have the pre-eminence. Christ's name is Wonderful; and the redemption he wrought out is the most amazing of all God's wondrous works. We will rejoice and be glad in the Lord's day; not only that such a day is appointed, but in the occasion of it, Christ's becoming the Head. Sabbath days ought to be rejoicing days, then they are to us as the days of heaven. Let this Saviour be my Saviour, my Ruler. Let my soul prosper and be in health, in that peace and righteousness which his government brings. Let me have victory over the lusts that war against my soul; and let Divine grace subdue my heart. The duty which the Lord has made, brings light with it, true light. The duty this privilege calls for, is here set forth; the sacrifices we are to offer to God in gratitude for redeeming love, are ourselves; not to be slain upon the altar, but living sacrifices, to be bound to the altar; spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise, in which our hearts must be engaged. The psalmist praises God, and calls upon all about him to give thanks to God for the glad tidings of great joy to all people, that there is a Redeemer, even Christ the Lord. In him the covenant of grace is made sure and everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/118.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the day which the Lord hath made - As if it were a new day, made for this very occasion; a day which the writer of the psalm did not expect to see, and which seemed therefore to have been created out of the ordinary course, and added to the other days. He was in danger of death; his days were likely to be cut off and ended, so that he should see no more. But God had spared him, and added this joyous day to his life; and it was meet that for this he should be praised. It was so full of joy, so unexpected, so bright, so cheerful, that it appeared to be a new day coming fresh from the hand of the Almighty, unlike the other days of the year. So the Sabbath - the day that commemorates the resurrection of the Redeemer - is God's day. He claims it. He seems to have made it anew for man. Amidst the other days of the week - in a world where the ordinary days are filled up with so much of earth, so much toil, trouble, care, vexation, vanity, wickedness - it seems like one of the days that God made when he first made the world; before sin and sorrow entered; when all was calm, serene, happy. The Sabbath is so calm, so bright, so cheerful, so benign in its influence; it is so full of pleasant and holy associations and reminiscences, that it seems to be a day fresh from the hand of God, unlike the other days of the week, and made especially, as if by a new act of creation, for the good of mankind. So when a man is raised up from sickness - from the borders of the grave - it seems to be a new life given to him. Each day, week, month, year that he may live, is so much added to his life, as if it were created anew for this very purpose. He should, therefore, regard it not as his own, but as so much given to him by the special mercy and providence of God - as if added on to his life. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>.<p>We will rejoice and be glad in it - The psalmist, and all who united with him in his thanksgivings. So the Christian Sabbath. It is a day of joy - all joy, and no sorrow. It is a day to be happy in; a day of rest; a day, when the cares and toils of life are suspended; a day, when we are no longer harassed with those things which vex us in the worldliness of the week; a day, when we think of God, of redemption, of hope, of heaven. The Sabbath should be a day of joy, and not of gloom; it would be the happiest of all days to weary and jaded people everywhere, if they observed it aright. In a world of toil and sorrow, it is among the richest of God's blessings to people; it strengthens, refreshes, and cheers the heart of burdened and sorrowful man here; it lifts the soul to joyous contemplation of that eternal Sabbath where wearisome toll and sorrow shall be no more. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/118.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, Israel too then begins as one man to praise the ever-gracious goodness of God. &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, the Jod of which might easily become inaudible after &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, has an emphatic Dagesh as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-18.htm">Psalm 118:18</a>, and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; has the orthophonic stroke beside &#1510;&#1512; (the so-called &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;), which points to the correct tone-syllable of the word that has Dech&#1502;.<p>(Note: Vid., Baer's Thorath Emeth, p. 7 note, and p. 21, end of note 1.)<p>Instead of &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; it is here pointed &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, which also occurs in other instances not only with distinctive, but also (though not uniformly) with conjunctive accents.<p>(Note: Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a> considers the pointing &#1511;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; to be occasioned by Dech, and in fact &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; in the passage before us has Tarcha, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a> Munach; but in the passage before us, if we read &#1489;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as one word according to the Masora, &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is rather to be accented with Mugrash; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a> the reading &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is found side by side with &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (e.g., in Bibl.

Nevertheless &#1510;&#1512;&#1508;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, and &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-19.htm">Job 30:19</a> (according to Kimchi's Michlol, 30a), beside Mercha, show that the pointing beside conjunctive as beside disjunctive accents wavers between a&amp; and a4, although a4 is properly only justified beside disjunctive accents, and &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; also really only occurs in pause.)<p>The constructions is a pregnant one (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-1.htm">2 Chronicles 32:1</a>): He answered me by removing me to a free space (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-20.htm">Psalm 18:20</a>).

It has its advocates even in the Talmud (B.

In that passage it is still more clear than in the passage before us that by the Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; Jahve is not meant to be designated as unus e multis, but as a helper who outweighs the greatest multitude of helpers. The Jewish people had experienced this helpful succour of Jahve in opposition to the persecutions of the Samaritans and the satraps during the building of the Temple; and had at the same time learned what is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7-8</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>), that trust in Jahve (for which &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489; is the proper word) proves true, and trust in men, on the contrary, and especially in princes, is deceptive; for under Pseudo-Smerdis the work, begun under Cyrus, and represented as open to suspicion even in the reign of Cambyses, was interdicted. But in the reign of Darius it again became free: Jahve showed that He disposes events and the hearts of men in favour of His people, so that out of this has grown up in the minds of His people the confident expectation of a world-subduing supremacy expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>.<p>The clauses <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>, expressed in the perfect form, are intended more hypothetically than as describing facts.

The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is that which states the ground or reason, and then becomes directly confirmatory and assuring (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-4.htm">Psalm 128:4</a>), which here, after the "in the name of Jahve" that precedes it, is applied and placed just as in the oath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>. And in general, as Redslob has demonstrated, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has not originally a relative, but a positive (determining) signification, &#1499; being just as much a demonstrative sound as &#1491;, &#1494;, &#1513;&#1473;, and &#1514; (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;'&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, ecce, hic, illic, with the Doric &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). The notion of compassing round about is heightened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a> by the juxtaposition of two forms of the same verb (Ges. 67, rem. 10), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a>, and frequently.

The Pual points to the punishing power that comes upon them: they are extinguished (exstinguuntur) like a fire of thorns, the crackling flame of which expires as quickly as it has blazed up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a> the language of Israel is addressed to the hostile worldly power, as the antithesis shows. It thrust, yea thrust (inf. intens.) Israel, that it might fall (&#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;; with reference to the pointing, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-15.htm">Psalm 40:15</a>); but Jahve's help would not suffer it to come to that pass. Therefore the song at the Red Sea is revived in the heart and mouth of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>) is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (in MSS also written &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;) is a collateral form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (Ew. 255, a), and here signifies the lofty self-consciousness which is united with the possession of power: pride and its expression an exclamation of joy. Concerning &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>.

It is not the part. Pil. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>), since the rejection of the participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not elsewhere with Pilel (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The word yields a simpler sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; rome&#772;ma&#772;&#769;h is only the fuller form for rama&#772;&#769;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (cf. ra&#772;&#769;mah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). It is not its own strength that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true, most severely chastened it (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the suffix anni as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with the emphatic Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>), but still with moderation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>.). He has not suffered Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation, that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the Temple. </body></html>
