God is sometimes the strength of his people, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, though they want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Such were the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/118.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is my strength and song - He is the source of strength to me; and he is the subject of my praise.

It being in the name of the Lord the enemies of the psalmist were destroyed; and having obtained help of him when sore thrust at, he gives him all the glory, and ascribes nothing to himself. It was the Lord that strengthened him, helped him, and gave him the victory. The Lord is the author and giver of strength, natural and spiritual; he is the "strength" of the hearts and lives of his people, and of their salvation; and therefore is their "song", the matter of it: they sing of his nature and perfections, of his works of providence and grace, of his righteousness and salvation, as follows: <p>and is become my salvation; the author of temporal, spiritual, and eternal salvation; which the psalmist saw his interest in, and was assured of, and therefore sung praise on that account; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/118.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> song, and is become my salvation.</span><p>(f) In that he was delivered, it came not from himself, not from the power of man, but only from God's favour, therefore he will praise him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/118.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, Israel too then begins as one man to praise the ever-gracious goodness of God. &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, the Jod of which might easily become inaudible after &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, has an emphatic Dagesh as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-18.htm">Psalm 118:18</a>, and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; has the orthophonic stroke beside &#1510;&#1512; (the so-called &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;), which points to the correct tone-syllable of the word that has Dech&#1502;.<p>(Note: Vid., Baer's Thorath Emeth, p. 7 note, and p. 21, end of note 1.)<p>Instead of &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; it is here pointed &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, which also occurs in other instances not only with distinctive, but also (though not uniformly) with conjunctive accents.<p>(Note: Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a> considers the pointing &#1511;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; to be occasioned by Dech, and in fact &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; in the passage before us has Tarcha, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a> Munach; but in the passage before us, if we read &#1489;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as one word according to the Masora, &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is rather to be accented with Mugrash; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a> the reading &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is found side by side with &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (e.g., in Bibl. Bomberg. 1521). Nevertheless &#1510;&#1512;&#1508;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, and &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-19.htm">Job 30:19</a> (according to Kimchi's Michlol, 30a), beside Mercha, show that the pointing beside conjunctive as beside disjunctive accents wavers between a&amp; and a4, although a4 is properly only justified beside disjunctive accents, and &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; also really only occurs in pause.)<p>The constructions is a pregnant one (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-1.htm">2 Chronicles 32:1</a>): He answered me by removing me to a free space (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-20.htm">Psalm 18:20</a>). Both lines end with &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;; nevertheless the reading &#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; is attested by the Masora (vid., Baer's Psalterium, pp. 132f.), instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;. It has its advocates even in the Talmud (B. Pesachim 117a), and signifies a boundless extent, &#1497;&#1492; expressing the highest degree of comparison, like &#1502;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>, the deepest darkness.

The Targum and Jerome, however, render it as we do; it is highly improbable that in one and the same verse the divine name should not be intended to be used in the same force of meaning. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-10.htm">Psalm 56:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm">Psalm 56:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>) echoes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-6.htm">Psalm 118:6</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a> <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1-7</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-6.htm">Psalm 54:6</a>) is in the mind of the later poet. In that passage it is still more clear than in the passage before us that by the Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; Jahve is not meant to be designated as unus e multis, but as a helper who outweighs the greatest multitude of helpers. The Jewish people had experienced this helpful succour of Jahve in opposition to the persecutions of the Samaritans and the satraps during the building of the Temple; and had at the same time learned what is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7-8</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>), that trust in Jahve (for which &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489; is the proper word) proves true, and trust in men, on the contrary, and especially in princes, is deceptive; for under Pseudo-Smerdis the work, begun under Cyrus, and represented as open to suspicion even in the reign of Cambyses, was interdicted. But in the reign of Darius it again became free: Jahve showed that He disposes events and the hearts of men in favour of His people, so that out of this has grown up in the minds of His people the confident expectation of a world-subduing supremacy expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>.<p>The clauses <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>, expressed in the perfect form, are intended more hypothetically than as describing facts. The perfect is here set out in relief as a hypothetical tense by the following future. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; signifies, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, the heathen of every kind. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (in the Aramaic and Arabic with )&#1494; are both bees and wasps, which make themselves especially troublesome in harvest time. The suffix of &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; (from &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, to hew down, cut in pieces) is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-17.htm">Exodus 2:17</a>, and also beside a conjunctive accent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>. Yet the reading &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, like &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-17.htm">Habakkuk 2:17</a>, is here the better supported (vid., Gesenius, Lehrgebude, S. 177), and it has been adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is that which states the ground or reason, and then becomes directly confirmatory and assuring (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-4.htm">Psalm 128:4</a>), which here, after the "in the name of Jahve" that precedes it, is applied and placed just as in the oath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>. And in general, as Redslob has demonstrated, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has not originally a relative, but a positive (determining) signification, &#1499; being just as much a demonstrative sound as &#1491;, &#1494;, &#1513;&#1473;, and &#1514; (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;'&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, ecce, hic, illic, with the Doric &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). The notion of compassing round about is heightened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a> by the juxtaposition of two forms of the same verb (Ges. 67, rem. 10), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a>, and frequently. The figure of the bees is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>. The perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>) describes their destruction, which takes place instantly and unexpectedly. The Pual points to the punishing power that comes upon them: they are extinguished (exstinguuntur) like a fire of thorns, the crackling flame of which expires as quickly as it has blazed up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a> the language of Israel is addressed to the hostile worldly power, as the antithesis shows. It thrust, yea thrust (inf. intens.) Israel, that it might fall (&#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;; with reference to the pointing, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-15.htm">Psalm 40:15</a>); but Jahve's help would not suffer it to come to that pass. Therefore the song at the Red Sea is revived in the heart and mouth of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>) is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (in MSS also written &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;) is a collateral form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (Ew. 255, a), and here signifies the lofty self-consciousness which is united with the possession of power: pride and its expression an exclamation of joy. Concerning &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>. As at that time, the cry of exultation and of salvation (i.e., of deliverance and of victory) is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of Jahve - they sing - &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>), practises valour, proves itself energetic, gains (maintains) the victory. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is Milra, and therefore an adjective: victoriosa (Ew. 120 d), from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;. It is not the part. Pil. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>), since the rejection of the participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not elsewhere with Pilel (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The word yields a simpler sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; rome&#772;ma&#772;&#769;h is only the fuller form for rama&#772;&#769;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (cf. ra&#772;&#769;mah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). It is not its own strength that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true, most severely chastened it (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the suffix anni as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with the emphatic Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>), but still with moderation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>.). He has not suffered Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation, that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the Temple. </body></html>
