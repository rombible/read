If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.">1 Samuel 26:19</a>,) as the builders of a house do a stone, which they judge unfit to be employed in it: am now become king over Judah and Israel, and a type of that glorious king, who shall hereafter be in like manner rejected,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-14.htm" title="But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.">Luke 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-17.htm" title="And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?">Luke 20:17</a>,) and then exalted by God, to be Lord of all the world, and the foundation of all men’s hopes and happiness.” The reader will observe, the commonwealth of Israel, and the church of God, are here, and elsewhere in the Scriptures, compared to a building, wherein, as the people were the stones, so the princes and rulers were the builders. And as these master-builders, here first referred to, rejected David, as an obscure and rebellious person, that ought not only to be refused as a governor in their state, but crushed and destroyed; so their successors rejected Jesus of Nazareth, as too poor and mean to be acknowledged for their expected Messiah; as an enemy to Moses, a friend to sinners, and a blasphemer against God, and therefore deserving death and everlasting destruction. <span class="ital">The head stone of the corner, </span>means that which joins the walls, and knits the building together; as David had now joined together the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah under his sole government, and as Christ joined together both Jews and Gentiles, as is beautifully set forth <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;...">Ephesians 2:14-22</a>. So that we have here an illustrious prophecy of the humiliation and exaltation of our Lord Jesus, of his sufferings, and the glory that should follow. And although David, in this noted prophecy, first alluded to himself, and his own condition, yet it is not to be doubted but that, having the prophetical Spirit, he foresaw the coming of Christ, and the ill usage he should meet with from the Jews, of which he speaks very particularly Psalms 22. and elsewhere; and that, having his thoughts much taken up with Christ, and the events of his kingdom, he had him principally in his eye, in these and the following words. And therefore this place is justly expounded of Christ in the New Testament, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-10.htm" title="And have you not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:">Mark 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm" title="This is the stone which was set at nothing of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-32.htm" title="Why?

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, Israel too then begins as one man to praise the ever-gracious goodness of God. &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;, the Jod of which might easily become inaudible after &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, has an emphatic Dagesh as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-18.htm">Psalm 118:18</a>, and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; has the orthophonic stroke beside &#1510;&#1512; (the so-called &#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;), which points to the correct tone-syllable of the word that has Dech&#1502;.<p>(Note: Vid., Baer's Thorath Emeth, p. 7 note, and p. 21, end of note 1.)<p>Instead of &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; it is here pointed &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, which also occurs in other instances not only with distinctive, but also (though not uniformly) with conjunctive accents.<p>(Note: Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a> considers the pointing &#1511;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; to be occasioned by Dech, and in fact &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; in the passage before us has Tarcha, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a> Munach; but in the passage before us, if we read &#1489;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; as one word according to the Masora, &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is rather to be accented with Mugrash; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a> the reading &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is found side by side with &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (e.g., in Bibl. Bomberg. 1521). Nevertheless &#1510;&#1512;&#1508;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>, and &#1492;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-19.htm">Job 30:19</a> (according to Kimchi's Michlol, 30a), beside Mercha, show that the pointing beside conjunctive as beside disjunctive accents wavers between a&amp; and a4, although a4 is properly only justified beside disjunctive accents, and &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; also really only occurs in pause.)<p>The constructions is a pregnant one (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-1.htm">2 Chronicles 32:1</a>): He answered me by removing me to a free space (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-20.htm">Psalm 18:20</a>). Both lines end with &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;; nevertheless the reading &#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; is attested by the Masora (vid., Baer's Psalterium, pp. 132f.), instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1468;. It has its advocates even in the Talmud (B. Pesachim 117a), and signifies a boundless extent, &#1497;&#1492; expressing the highest degree of comparison, like &#1502;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>, the deepest darkness.

The Targum and Jerome, however, render it as we do; it is highly improbable that in one and the same verse the divine name should not be intended to be used in the same force of meaning. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-10.htm">Psalm 56:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm">Psalm 56:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a>) echoes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-6.htm">Psalm 118:6</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a> <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1-7</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-6.htm">Psalm 54:6</a>) is in the mind of the later poet. In that passage it is still more clear than in the passage before us that by the Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; Jahve is not meant to be designated as unus e multis, but as a helper who outweighs the greatest multitude of helpers. The Jewish people had experienced this helpful succour of Jahve in opposition to the persecutions of the Samaritans and the satraps during the building of the Temple; and had at the same time learned what is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7-8</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>), that trust in Jahve (for which &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489; is the proper word) proves true, and trust in men, on the contrary, and especially in princes, is deceptive; for under Pseudo-Smerdis the work, begun under Cyrus, and represented as open to suspicion even in the reign of Cambyses, was interdicted. But in the reign of Darius it again became free: Jahve showed that He disposes events and the hearts of men in favour of His people, so that out of this has grown up in the minds of His people the confident expectation of a world-subduing supremacy expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>.<p>The clauses <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>, expressed in the perfect form, are intended more hypothetically than as describing facts. The perfect is here set out in relief as a hypothetical tense by the following future. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; signifies, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, the heathen of every kind. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (in the Aramaic and Arabic with )&#1494; are both bees and wasps, which make themselves especially troublesome in harvest time. The suffix of &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; (from &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, to hew down, cut in pieces) is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-17.htm">Exodus 2:17</a>, and also beside a conjunctive accent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a>. Yet the reading &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, like &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-17.htm">Habakkuk 2:17</a>, is here the better supported (vid., Gesenius, Lehrgebude, S. 177), and it has been adopted by Norzi, Heidenheim, and Baer. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is that which states the ground or reason, and then becomes directly confirmatory and assuring (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-4.htm">Psalm 128:4</a>), which here, after the "in the name of Jahve" that precedes it, is applied and placed just as in the oath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>. And in general, as Redslob has demonstrated, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has not originally a relative, but a positive (determining) signification, &#1499; being just as much a demonstrative sound as &#1491;, &#1494;, &#1513;&#1473;, and &#1514; (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;'&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, ecce, hic, illic, with the Doric &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). The notion of compassing round about is heightened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-11.htm">Psalm 118:11</a> by the juxtaposition of two forms of the same verb (Ges. 67, rem. 10), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a>, and frequently. The figure of the bees is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>. The perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>) describes their destruction, which takes place instantly and unexpectedly. The Pual points to the punishing power that comes upon them: they are extinguished (exstinguuntur) like a fire of thorns, the crackling flame of which expires as quickly as it has blazed up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-13.htm">Psalm 118:13</a> the language of Israel is addressed to the hostile worldly power, as the antithesis shows. It thrust, yea thrust (inf. intens.) Israel, that it might fall (&#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;; with reference to the pointing, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-15.htm">Psalm 40:15</a>); but Jahve's help would not suffer it to come to that pass. Therefore the song at the Red Sea is revived in the heart and mouth of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>) is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>. &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (in MSS also written &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;) is a collateral form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; (Ew. 255, a), and here signifies the lofty self-consciousness which is united with the possession of power: pride and its expression an exclamation of joy. Concerning &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>. As at that time, the cry of exultation and of salvation (i.e., of deliverance and of victory) is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of Jahve - they sing - &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>), practises valour, proves itself energetic, gains (maintains) the victory. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; is Milra, and therefore an adjective: victoriosa (Ew. 120 d), from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;. It is not the part. Pil. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>), since the rejection of the participial Mem occurs in connection with Poal and Pual, but not elsewhere with Pilel (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The word yields a simpler sense, too, as adject. participle Kal; rome&#772;ma&#772;&#769;h is only the fuller form for rama&#772;&#769;h, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (cf. ra&#772;&#769;mah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). It is not its own strength that avails for Israel's exultation of victory, but the energy of the right hand of Jahve. Being come to the brink of the abyss, Israel is become anew sure of its immortality through Him. God has, it is true, most severely chastened it (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; with the suffix anni as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm">Genesis 30:6</a>, and &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; with the emphatic Dagesh, which neither reduplicates nor connects, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>), but still with moderation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>.). He has not suffered Israel to fall a prey to death, but reserved it for its high vocation, that it may see the mighty deeds of God and proclaim them to all the world. Amidst such celebration of Jahve the festive procession of the dedication of the Temple has arrived at the enclosure wall of the Temple. </body></html>
