God saw it all. He was able to save him that was thus persecuted and opposed. And yet he did not interpose. He seemed to pay no attention to it. He appeared to be indifferent to it. The psalmist, therefore, asks "how long" this was to continue. did not doubt that God would, at some thee, interpose and save him; but what was so mysterious to him was the fact that he looked so calmly on - that he saw it all, and that he did not interpose when he could so easily do it. The same question we may now ask, and may constantly ask, in regard to the wickedness in the world - "and no one can answer it." No one can tell why God, when he sees the state of things on earth, is so calm (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>), and apparently so indifferent; why he does not hasten to deliver his people, and to punish the wicked. "Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in thy sight," is all the answer that can be given to this inquiry. Yet it should have occurred to the psalmist, and it should be observed now, that the fact that God seems to be indifferent to the state of things, does riot proves that he is indifferent. There is an eternity to come, in which there will be ample thee to adjust human affairs, and to develop fully the divine character and counsels.<p>Rescue my soul from their destructions - My life from the destruction which they are aiming to accomplish.<p>My darling - Margin, "my only one." See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>. The reference here is to "his own soul" or life. It is the language of tenderness addressed to himself. He had but one soul or life, and that was dear to him, as an only child is dear to its parent.<p>From the lions - Enemies, described as lions; having the fierceness and savage fury of lions. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a> it is, "from the power of the dog." The idea is the same in both places.

The futures in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-12.htm">Psalm 35:12</a> describe that which at present takes place. &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; are &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (lxx). They demand from him a confession of acts and things which lie entirely outside his consciousness and his way of acting (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-5.htm">Psalm 69:5</a>): they would gladly brand him as a perjurer, as an usurper, and as a plunderer. What David complains of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-12.htm">Psalm 35:12</a>, we hear Saul confess in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-18.htm">1 Samuel 24:18</a>; the charge of ingratitude is therefore well-grounded. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is not dependent on &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, in which case one would have looked for &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500; rather than &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;, but a substantival clause: "bereavement is to my soul," its condition is that of being forsaken by all those who formerly showed me marks of affection; all these have, as it were, died off so far as I am concerned. Not only had David been obliged to save his parents by causing them to flee to Moab, but Michal was also torn from him, Jonathan removed, and all those at the court of Saul, who had hitherto sought the favour and friendship of the highly-gifted and highly-honoured son-in-law of the king, were alienated from him. And how sincerely and sympathisingly had he reciprocated their leanings towards himself! By &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>, he contrasts himself with the ungrateful and unfeeling ones. Instead of &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, the expression is &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;; the tendency of poetry for the use of the substantival clause is closely allied to its fondness for well-conceived brevity and pictorial definition. He manifested towards them a love which knew no distinction between the ego and tu, which regarded their sorrow and their guilt as his own, and joined with them in their expiation for it; his head was lowered upon his breast, or he cowered, like Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42</a>), upon the ground with his head hanging down upon his breast even to his knees, so that that which came forth from the inmost depths of his nature returned again as it were in broken accents into his bosom. Riehm's rendering, "at their ungodliness and hostility my prayer for things not executed came back," is contrary to the connection, and makes one look for &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;. Perret-Gentil correctly renders it, Je priai la tte penche sur la poitrine.<p>The Psalmist goes on to say in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>, I went about as for a friend, for a brother to me, i.e., as if the sufferer had been such to me. With &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;, used of the solemn slowness of gait, which corresponds to the sacredness of pain, alternates &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1495; used of the being bowed down very low, in which the heavy weight of pain finds expression. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1501;, not: like the mourning (from &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;, like &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; from &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;) of a mother (Hitzig), but, since a personal &#1488;&#1489;&#1500; is more natural, and next to the mourning for an only child the loss of a mother (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-67.htm">Genesis 24:67</a>) strikes the deepest wound: like one who mourns (&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;,<p>(Note: According to the old Babylonian reading (belonging to a period when Pathach and Segol were as yet not distinguished from one another), &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500; (with the sign of Pathach and the stroke for Raphe below  equals  ); vid., Pinsker, Zur Geschichte des Karaismus, S. 141, and Einleitung, S. 118.)<p>like &#1500;&#1489;&#1503;&#1470;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-12.htm">Genesis 49:12</a>, from &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;, construct state, like &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;) for a mother (the objective genitive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>). &#1511;&#1491;&#1512; signifies the colours, outward appearance, and attire of mourning: with dark clothes, with tearful unwashed face, and with neglected beard. But as for them - how do they act at the present time, when he finds himself in &#1510;&#1500;&#1506; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>), a sideway direction, i.e., likely to fall (from &#1510;&#1500;&#1506;, Arab. d&#803;l&#8219;, to incline towards the side)? They rejoice and gather themselves together, and this assemblage of ungrateful friends rejoicing over another's misfortune, is augmented by the lowest rabble that attach themselves to them. The verb &#1504;&#1499;&#1492; means to smite; Niph. &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-6.htm">Job 30:6</a>, to be driven forth with a whip, after which the lxx renders it &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, Symm. &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and the Targum conterentes me verbis suis; cf. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>. But &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; cannot by itself mean smiters with the tongue. The adjective &#1504;&#1499;&#1492; signifies elsewhere with &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, one who is smitten in the feet, i.e., one who limps or halts, and with &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, but also without any addition, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>, one smitten in spirit, i.e., one deeply troubled or sorrowful. Thus, therefore, &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, may mean smitten, men, i.e., men who are brought low or reduced (Hengstenberg). It might also, after the Arabic nawika, to be injured in mind, anwak, stupid, silly (from the same root &#1504;&#1498;, to prick, smite, wound, cf. ichtalla, to be pierced through  equals  mad), be understood as those mentally deranged, enraged at nothing or without cause. But the former definition of the notion of the word is favoured by the continuation of the idea of the verbal adjective &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; by &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, persons of whom I have hitherto taken no notice because they were far removed from me, i.e., men belonging to the dregs of the people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-18.htm">Job 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>). The addition of &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; certainly makes Olshausen's conjecture that we should read &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; somewhat natural; but the expression then becomes tautological, and there are other instances also in which psalm-poesy goes beyond the ordinary range of words, in order to find language to describe that which is loathsome, in the most glaring way. &#1508;&#1512;&#1506;, to tear, rend in pieces, viz., with abusive and slanderous words (like Arab. qr&#8219; II) also does not occur anywhere else.<p>And what remarkable language we now meet with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-16.htm">Psalm 35:16</a>! &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1490; does not mean scorn or buffoonery, as Bttcher and Hitzig imagine,<p>(Note: The Talmudic &#1506;&#1490;&#1492; (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;), B. Sanhedrin 101b, which is said to mean "a jesting way of speaking," has all the less place here, as the reading wavers between &#1506;&#1490;&#1492; (&#1506;&#1490;&#1488;) and &#1488;&#1490;&#1488;.)<p>but according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12</a>, a cake of a round formation (like the Talmudic &#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;, a circle); &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;, jeering, jesting. Therefore &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1490; means: mockers for a cake, i.e., those who for a delicate morsel, for the sake of dainty fare, make scornful jokes, viz., about me, the persecuted one, vile parasites; German Tellerlecker, Bratenriecher, Greek &#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, &#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, Mediaeval Latin buccellarii. This &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1490;, which even Rashi interprets in substantially the same manner, stands either in a logical co-ordinate relation (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>) or in a logical as well as grammatical subordinate relation to its regens &#1495;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;. In the former case, it would be equivalent to: the profane, viz., the cake-jesters; in the latter, which is the more natural, and quite suitable: the profane ( equals  the profanest, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-24.htm">Ezekiel 7:24</a>) among cake-jesters. The &#1489;&#1468; is not the Beth of companionship or fellowship, to express which &#1506;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>) would have been used, but Beth essentiae or the Beth of characterisation: in the character of the most abject examples of this class of men do they gnash upon him with their teeth. The gerund &#1495;&#1512;&#1511; (of the noise of the teeth being pressed together, like Arab. h&#803;rq, of the crackling of a fire and the grating of a file), which is used according to Ges. 131, 4, b, carries its subject in itself. They gnash upon him with their teeth after the manner of the profanest among those, by whom their neighbour's honour is sold for a delicate morsel. </body></html>
