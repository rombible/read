This is a fruit of the old enmity in the seed of the serpent against the Seed of the woman. David in his afflictions, Christ in his sufferings, the church under persecution, and the Christian in the hour temptation, all beseech the Almighty to appear in their behalf, and to vindicate their cause. We are apt to justify uneasiness at the injuries men do us, by our never having given them cause to use us so ill; but this should make us easy, for then we may the more expect that God will plead our cause. David prayed to God to manifest himself in his trial. Let me have inward comfort under all outward troubles, to support my soul. If God, by his Spirit, witness to our spirits that he is our salvation, we need desire no more to make us happy. If God is our Friend, no matter who is our enemy. By the Spirit of prophecy, David foretells the just judgments of God that would come upon his enemies for their great wickedness. These are predictions, they look forward, and show the doom of the enemies of Christ and his kingdom. We must not desire or pray for the ruin of any enemies, except our lusts and the evil spirits that would compass our destruction. A traveller benighted in a bad road, is an expressive emblem of a sinner walking in the slippery and dangerous ways of temptation. But David having committed his cause to God, did not doubt of his own deliverance. The bones are the strongest parts of the body. The psalmist here proposes to serve and glorify God with all his strength. If such language may be applied to outward salvation, how much more will it apply to heavenly things in Christ Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord - That is, I shall be joyful, or will rejoice. This is said in anticipation of the interposition of God in destroying his enemies, and in delivering him from danger. It is not joy in the destruction of others; it is joy that he himself would be delivered. Our own deliverance from the hand of our enemies may involve the necessity of their being cut off. What we rejoice in, in such a case, is not their ruin, but our own deliverance; and for this it can never be improper to give thanks. The psalmist says that he would rejoice "in the Lord." It would not be in his own skill or valor, but in what God had done to save him.

Not in the destruction of his enemies, but in the God of his salvation; the Targum is, "in the Word of the Lord"; the essential Word of God, the promised Messiah, Saviour, and Redeemer. Christ is the object of a believer's joy; he rejoices in his person, as he is the mighty God, able to save him, and to keep what he has committed to him, and to preserve him from falling; as he is God and man in one person, and so fit to be a Mediator between God and man; and as he is a Prophet to instruct him, a Priest to expiate his sin and make intercession for him, and as a King to rule over, protect, and defend him; and as he stands in the relations of a father, husband, brother, and friend: he rejoices in what he has done and is doing; in that this Word is made flesh, and has obtained eternal redemption, and now appears in the presence of God, as an advocate and intercessor: it follows, <p>it shall rejoice in his salvation; that which Jehovah the Father has determined upon, provided for, and has formed the scheme of; that which Jehovah the Son undertook to accomplish, and now has finished; and that which Jehovah the Spirit had made a discovery and application of unto the psalmist, in answer to his request in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-3.htm">Psalm 35:3</a>. This filled him with so much joy, as it does every believer that has a view of interest in it; seeing hereby the law is fulfilled, justice is satisfied, sin is atoned for, the pardon of it is procured, an everlasting righteousness is brought in, and a solid foundation laid for hope of eternal glory and happiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9, 10</span>.

"Salvation" here is, no doubt, especially, deliverance from the immediate danger, but, perhaps, even here, not only that (see the comment on ver. 3). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The psalmist begins in a martial and anthropomorphical style such as we have not hitherto met with. On the ultima-accentuation of &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>. Both &#1488;&#1514; are signs of the accusative. This is a more natural rendering here, where the psalmist implores God to subjugate his foes, than to regard &#1488;&#1514; as equivalent to &#1506;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a> with ib. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>); and, moreover, for the very same reason the expression in this instance is &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, (in the Kal, which otherwise only lends the part. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-2.htm">Psalm 56:2</a>., to the Niph. &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;) instead of the reciprocal form &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;. It is usually supposed that &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; means properly vorare, and war is consequently conceived of as a devouring of men; but the Arabic offers another primary meaning: to press close and compact (Niph. to one another), consequently &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; means a dense crowd, a dense bustle and tumult (cf. the Homeric &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). The summons to Jahve to arm, and that in a twofold manner, viz., with the &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; for warding off the hostile blow and &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-13.htm">Psalm 5:13</a>) which covers the body like a testudo - by which, inasmuch as it is impossible to hold both shields at the same time, the figure is idealised - is meant to express, that He is to make Himself felt by the foes, in every possible way, to their own confounding, as the unapproachable One. The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; (in the character of help turned towards me) is the so-called Beth essentiae,<p>(Note: The Hebrew Beth essentiae is used much more freely and extensively than the Arabic, which is joined exclusively to the predicate of a simple clause, where in our language the verb is "to be," and as a rule only to the predicate of negative clauses: laisa bi-hak&#305;&#770;mim, he is not wise, or laisa bi-l-hak&#305;&#770;mi, he is not the wise man. The predicate can accordingly be indeterminate or determinate. Moreover, in Hebrew, where this &#1489; is found with the predicate, with the complement of the subject, or even, though only as a solecism (vid., Gesenius' Thesaurus p. 175), with the subject itself, the word to which it is prefixed may be determinate, whether as an attribute determined by itself (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;), by a suffix (as above, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-5.htm">Psalm 146:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>), or even by the article. At all events no syntactic objection can be brought against the interpretations of &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, "in the quality of smoke," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>; cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-33.htm">Psalm 78:33</a>, and of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, "in the character of the soul," <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>.)<p>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a> (tanquam argentum), and frequently. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; has the same meaning as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>, viz., to bring forth, draw forth, to draw or unsheath (a sword); for as a sword is sheathed when not in use, so a spear is kept in the &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; (Odyss. i. 128). Even Parchon understands &#1505;&#1490;&#1512; to mean a weapon; and the word &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, in Herodotus, Xenophon, and Strabo, a northern Asiatic, more especially a Scythian, battle-axe, has been compared here; <p>(Note: Probably one and the same word with the Armenian sakr, to which are assigned the (Italian) meanings mannaja, scure, brando ferro, in Ciakciak's Armenian Lexicon; cf. Lagarde's Gesammelte Abhandlungen, 1866, S. 203.)<p>but the battle-axe was not a Hebrew weapon, and &#1505;&#1490;&#1512;, which, thus defectively written, has the look of an imperative, also gives the best sense when so taken (lxx &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Targ. &#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;), viz., close, i.e., cut off, interclude scil. viam. The word has Dech, because &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1497;, "casting Thyself against my persecutors," belongs to both the preceding summonses. Dachselt rightly directs attention to the similar sequence of the accents in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a>. The Mosaic figure of Jahve as a man of war (&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>.) is worked out here with brilliant colours, under the impulse of a wrathful spirit. But we see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-3.htm">Psalm 35:3</a> what a spiritual meaning, nevertheless, the whole description is intended to convey. In God's intervention, thus manifested in facts, he would gladly hear His consolatory utterance to himself. The burden of his cry is that God's love may break through the present outward appearance of wrath and make itself felt by him. </body></html>
