The LXX. and Vulg. have, “they tempted me, they mocked me with a mocking”; Symmachus, “in hypocrisy, with feigned words”; Chaldee, “with derisive words of flattery.” All these take the word rendered in the Authorised Version, “feasts,” as a cognate of a word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-11.htm" title="For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.">Isaiah 28:11</a>, translated “stammering,” but which means rather, “barbarisms.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-19.htm" title="You shall not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than you can perceive; of a stammering tongue, that you can not understand.">Isaiah 33:19</a>.) The word rendered “hypocritical” more properly means “profane” or “impious.” With these meanings we <span class= "ital">get </span>a very good sense (with evident reference to the malicious attacks of foreigners, or of the anti-national party that affected foreign ways) <span class= "ital">in the manner of profane barbaric barbarisms, </span>or <span class= "ital">with profanity and barbarism.</span><p>As to the rendering “feasts,” it comes from treating the word as the same used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-13.htm" title="And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it to me, and after make for you and for your son.">1Kings 17:13</a>) for a “cake.” “Cake-mockers” are explained to be parasites who hang about the tables of the rich, getting their dinner in return for their buffooneries.

Herein he was a type of Christ. David shows how tenderly he had behaved towards them in afflictions. We ought to mourn for the sins of those who do not mourn for themselves. We shall not lose by the good offices we do to any, how ungrateful soever they may be. Let us learn to possess our souls in patience and meekness like David, or rather after Christ's example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With hypocritical mockers in feasts - The word rendered hypocritical here - &#1495;&#1504;&#1507;  cha&#770;ne&#770;ph - properly means people "profane, impious, abandoned." It refers to such persons as are commonly found in scenes of revelry. The words rendered "mockers at feasts," it is scarcely possible to render literally. The word translated, "mockers," - &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;  la&#770;&#8219;e&#770;g - means properly one who stammers, or who speaks a foreign language; then, a jester, mocker, buffoon. The word rendered "feasts" - &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1490;  ma&#770;&#8219;o&#770;g - means "a cake of bread;" and the whole phrase would denote "cake-jesters;" "table-buffoons" - those, perhaps, who act the part of jesters at the tables of the rich for the sake of good eating. "Gesenius." - The meaning is, that he was exposed to the ribaldry or jesting of that low class of people; that those with whom he had formerly been on friendly terms, and whom he had admitted to his own table, and for whom he had wept in their troubles, now drew around themselves that low and common class of parasites and buffoons for the purpose of ridiculing or deriding him.<p>They gnashed upon me with their teeth - The act of gnashing with the teeth is expressive of anger or wrath. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-42.htm">Matthew 13:42</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-50.htm">Matthew 13:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-51.htm">Matthew 24:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>.

That is, the abjects gathered, themselves together with such; these may design Saul's courtiers, his parasites and flatterers, and who were hypocrites in religion also, and made it their business at Saul's table, and in their banquetings and revellings, to mock at David; and who were "hypocritical mockers of" or "for a piece of bread" (y), as it may be rendered; the same word is used for a pastry, or cake, and for flatterers; and they used at their feasts to throw a pastry baked with honey to parasites (z), for the word signifies a cake, or a piece of bread, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12</a>; and the sense may be, that they mocked at David as wanting a piece of bread, and that he had brought himself to one; or else those, and they that gathered with them especially, mocked at David for the sake of a meal; or for a piece of bread; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-27.htm">Proverbs 28:27</a>; and such sort of men were the enemies of Christ, the Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites to God, flatterers of men, who loved feasts, and the uppermost places there, and whose god was their belly; and who were mockers of Christ, derided his doctrine, and scoffed at his person, especially when he hung upon the cross; <p>they gnashed upon me with their teeth; in indignation and contempt; as Stephen's enemies did on him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54</a>. <p>(y)  "subsannatoribus subcineritii panis", Vatablus; "subsanmantes propter placentam", Piscator; "scoffers for a cake of bread", Ainsworth; hence a "parasite", a "table companion", or "trencher friend", is used for a "flatterer", vid.

The downfall of the power that is opposed to God will be followed by the joy of triumph. The bones of the body, which elsewhere are mentioned as sharing only in the anguish of the soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-3.htm">Psalm 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>), are here made to share (as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>) in the joy, into which the anxiety, that agitated even the marrow of the bones, is changed. The joy which he experiences in his soul shall throb through every member of his body and multiply itself, as it were, into a choir of praiseful voices. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; with a conjunctive accent and without Makkeph, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-7.htm">Proverbs 19:7</a> (not &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;, vid., the Masora in Baer's Psalterium p. 133), is to be read ca&#772;l (with &#1511;&#1502;&#1509; &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, opp. &#1511;&#1502;&#1509; &#1495;&#1496;&#1493;&#1507;) according to Kimchi. According to Lonzano, however, it is to be read col, the conjunctive accent having an equal power with Makkeph; but this view is false, since an accent can never be placed against Kametz chatuph. The exclamation &#1502;&#1497; &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, where, according to the Masora, it is to be pointed &#1502;&#1497; &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498;, as Ben Naphtali also points it in the passage before us. The Dagesh, which is found in the former passage and is wanting here, sharpens and hardens at the same time; it requires that the expression should be emphatically pronounced (without there being any danger in this instance of its being slurred over); it does not serve to denote the closer connection, but to give it especial prominence. &#1495;&#1494;&#1511; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, stronger than he, is equivalent to: strong, whereas the other is weak, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-11.htm">Jeremiah 31:11</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>, &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, righteous, whereas he is ungodly. The repetition of &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; is meant to say: He rescues the &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, who is &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (poor) enough already, from him who would take even the few goods that he possesses. </body></html>
