Literally, "My enemies of falsehood;" that is, who are "falsely" my foes; who have no just cause for being opposed to me. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>. David was conscious that he had done them no wrong, or that he had given no occasion for their conduct toward him, and hence, his prayer is simply a request that justice might be done.<p>Neither let them wink with the eye - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-12.htm">Job 15:12</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a>. The word rendered "wink" means properly to tear or cut asunder; and then, to cut with the teeth, to bite; and hence, the phrase "to bite the lips," as an expression of malice, or mischief-making: <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-30.htm">Proverbs 16:30</a>; and to bite or pinch the eyes, that is, to press the eyelids together in the manner of biting the lips - also a gesture of malice or mischief. So Gesenius, Lexicon. But perhaps the more probable meaning is that of "winking" literally; or giving a significant wink of the eyes as an expression of triumph over anyone. In this sense the term is often used now.<p>That hate me without a cause - To whom I have given no occasion for opposition. In the case under consideration the psalmist regarded himself as entirely innocent in this respect. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. enemies wrongfully&#8212;by false and slanderous imputations.<p>wink with the eye&#8212;an insulting gesture (Pr 6:13).<p>without a cause&#8212;manifests more malice than having a wrong cause.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/35.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.<p>20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.<p>21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.<p>22 This thou hast seen, O Lord: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.<p>23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.<p>24 Judge me, O Lord, my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.<p>25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.<p>26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.<p>27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.<p>28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a><p>He earnestly prays that as they have no cause for their enmity, they may have no cause for triumph either in his folly, sin, or overthrow. "Neither let them wink with the eye that hale me without a cause." The winking of the eye was the low-bred sign of congratulation at the ruin of their victim, and it may also have been one of their scornful gestures as they gazed upon him whom they despised. To cause hatred is the mark of the wicked, to suffer it causelessly is the lot of the righteous. God is the natural Protector of all who are wronged, and he is the enemy of all oppressors.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a><p>"For they speak not peace." They love it not; how can they speak it? They are such troublers themselves that they cannot judge others to be peaceable. Out of the mouth comes what is in the heart. Riotous men charge others with sedition. "They devise deceitful mailers against them that are quiet in the land." David would fain have been an orderly citizen, but they laboured to make him a rebel. He could do nothing aright, all his dealings were misrepresented. This is an old trick of the enemy to brand good men with S.S on their cheeks, as sowers of sedition, though they have ever been a harmless race, like sheep among wolves. When mischief is meant, mischief is soon made. Unscrupulous partisans could even charge Jesus with seeking to overturn Caesar, much more will they thus accuse his household. At this very hour, those who stand up for the crown rights of King Jesus are called enemies of the church, favourers of Popery, friends of Atheists, levellers, red republicans, and it were hard to say what besides.

Complaint finds a voice in vers. 20, 21, and thanksgiving in ver. 28; but with these exceptions, the strophe is one long strain of prayer. The prayer is, first, negative: "Let not mine enemies rejoice" (ver. 19); "Keep not silence" (ver. 22); "Be <span class="accented">not</span> far from me" (ver. 22). But after this it becomes mainly positive: "Stir up thyself, and awake to judgment" (ver. 23); "Judge me, O Lord" (ver. 24); "Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that rejoice at my hurt" (ver. 26); "Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause" (ver. 27); "Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in my prosperity" (ver. 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-19.htm">Psalm 38:19</a>, where David says that those who "hated him wrongfully" were "multiplied").

They demand from him a confession of acts and things which lie entirely outside his consciousness and his way of acting (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-5.htm">Psalm 69:5</a>): they would gladly brand him as a perjurer, as an usurper, and as a plunderer. What David complains of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-12.htm">Psalm 35:12</a>, we hear Saul confess in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-18.htm">1 Samuel 24:18</a>; the charge of ingratitude is therefore well-grounded. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is not dependent on &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, in which case one would have looked for &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500; rather than &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;, but a substantival clause: "bereavement is to my soul," its condition is that of being forsaken by all those who formerly showed me marks of affection; all these have, as it were, died off so far as I am concerned. Not only had David been obliged to save his parents by causing them to flee to Moab, but Michal was also torn from him, Jonathan removed, and all those at the court of Saul, who had hitherto sought the favour and friendship of the highly-gifted and highly-honoured son-in-law of the king, were alienated from him. And how sincerely and sympathisingly had he reciprocated their leanings towards himself! By &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>, he contrasts himself with the ungrateful and unfeeling ones. Instead of &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, the expression is &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;; the tendency of poetry for the use of the substantival clause is closely allied to its fondness for well-conceived brevity and pictorial definition. He manifested towards them a love which knew no distinction between the ego and tu, which regarded their sorrow and their guilt as his own, and joined with them in their expiation for it; his head was lowered upon his breast, or he cowered, like Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42</a>), upon the ground with his head hanging down upon his breast even to his knees, so that that which came forth from the inmost depths of his nature returned again as it were in broken accents into his bosom. Riehm's rendering, "at their ungodliness and hostility my prayer for things not executed came back," is contrary to the connection, and makes one look for &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;. Perret-Gentil correctly renders it, Je priai la tte penche sur la poitrine.<p>The Psalmist goes on to say in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>, I went about as for a friend, for a brother to me, i.e., as if the sufferer had been such to me.

But as for them - how do they act at the present time, when he finds himself in &#1510;&#1500;&#1506; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm">Job 18:12</a>), a sideway direction, i.e., likely to fall (from &#1510;&#1500;&#1506;, Arab. d&#803;l&#8219;, to incline towards the side)? They rejoice and gather themselves together, and this assemblage of ungrateful friends rejoicing over another's misfortune, is augmented by the lowest rabble that attach themselves to them. The verb &#1504;&#1499;&#1492; means to smite; Niph. &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-6.htm">Job 30:6</a>, to be driven forth with a whip, after which the lxx renders it &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, Symm. &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and the Targum conterentes me verbis suis; cf. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>. But &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; cannot by itself mean smiters with the tongue. The adjective &#1504;&#1499;&#1492; signifies elsewhere with &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, one who is smitten in the feet, i.e., one who limps or halts, and with &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, but also without any addition, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>, one smitten in spirit, i.e., one deeply troubled or sorrowful. Thus, therefore, &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, may mean smitten, men, i.e., men who are brought low or reduced (Hengstenberg). It might also, after the Arabic nawika, to be injured in mind, anwak, stupid, silly (from the same root &#1504;&#1498;, to prick, smite, wound, cf. ichtalla, to be pierced through  equals  mad), be understood as those mentally deranged, enraged at nothing or without cause. But the former definition of the notion of the word is favoured by the continuation of the idea of the verbal adjective &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; by &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, persons of whom I have hitherto taken no notice because they were far removed from me, i.e., men belonging to the dregs of the people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-18.htm">Job 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>). The addition of &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; certainly makes Olshausen's conjecture that we should read &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; somewhat natural; but the expression then becomes tautological, and there are other instances also in which psalm-poesy goes beyond the ordinary range of words, in order to find language to describe that which is loathsome, in the most glaring way. &#1508;&#1512;&#1506;, to tear, rend in pieces, viz., with abusive and slanderous words (like Arab. qr&#8219; II) also does not occur anywhere else.<p>And what remarkable language we now meet with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-16.htm">Psalm 35:16</a>! &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1490; does not mean scorn or buffoonery, as Bttcher and Hitzig imagine,<p>(Note: The Talmudic &#1506;&#1490;&#1492; (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;), B.

Therefore &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1490; means: mockers for a cake, i.e., those who for a delicate morsel, for the sake of dainty fare, make scornful jokes, viz., about me, the persecuted one, vile parasites; German Tellerlecker, Bratenriecher, Greek &#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, &#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, Mediaeval Latin buccellarii. This &#1500;&#1506;&#1490;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1490;, which even Rashi interprets in substantially the same manner, stands either in a logical co-ordinate relation (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>) or in a logical as well as grammatical subordinate relation to its regens &#1495;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;. In the former case, it would be equivalent to: the profane, viz., the cake-jesters; in the latter, which is the more natural, and quite suitable: the profane ( equals  the profanest, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-24.htm">Ezekiel 7:24</a>) among cake-jesters. The &#1489;&#1468; is not the Beth of companionship or fellowship, to express which &#1506;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>) would have been used, but Beth essentiae or the Beth of characterisation: in the character of the most abject examples of this class of men do they gnash upon him with their teeth. The gerund &#1495;&#1512;&#1511; (of the noise of the teeth being pressed together, like Arab. h&#803;rq, of the crackling of a fire and the grating of a file), which is used according to Ges. 131, 4, b, carries its subject in itself. They gnash upon him with their teeth after the manner of the profanest among those, by whom their neighbour's honour is sold for a delicate morsel. </body></html>
