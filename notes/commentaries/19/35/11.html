Herein he was a type of Christ. David shows how tenderly he had behaved towards them in afflictions. We ought to mourn for the sins of those who do not mourn for themselves. We shall not lose by the good offices we do to any, how ungrateful soever they may be. Let us learn to possess our souls in patience and meekness like David, or rather after Christ's example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>False witnesses did rise up - Margin, "witnesses of wrong." The Hebrew is, "witnesses of "violence,"" &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;  cha&#770;ma&#770;s. That is, they were persons who, in what they said of me, were guilty of injustice and wrong. Their conduct was injurious to me as an act of "violence" would be.<p>They laid to my charge - Margin, as in Hebrew: "they asked me." The word "asked" here seems to be used in the sense of "demand;" that is, they demanded an "answer" to what was said. The usage appears to have been derived from courts, where the forms of trial may have been in the way of question and answer - the mode of accusation having been in the form of "asking" how a thing was, or whether it was so; and the defense being regarded as an "answer" to such an inquiry. Hence, it is synonymous with our expression of laying to the charge of anyone; or of accusing anyone.<p>Things that I knew not - Of which I had no knowledge; which never came into my mind. What those charges were the psalmist does not specify; but it is not uncommon for a good man to be falsely accused, and we are certain that such things occurred in the life of David. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

This is the old device of the ungodly, and we must not wonder if it be used against us as against our Master. To please Saul, there were always men to be found mean enough to impeach David. "they laid to my charge things that I knew not." He had not even a thought of sedition; he was loyal even to excess; yet they accused him of conspiring against the Lord's anointed. He was not only innocent, but ignorant of the fault alleged. It is well when our hands are so clean that no trace of dirt is upon them.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-12.htm">Psalm 35:12</a><p>"They rewarded me evil for good." This is devilish; but men have learned the lesson well of the old Destroyer, and practise it most perfectly. "To the spoiling of my soul." They robbed him of comfort, and even would have taken his life had it not been for special rescues from the hand of God. The wicked would strip the righteous naked to their very soul: they know no pity. There are only such limits to human malice as God himself may see fit to place.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a><p>"But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth." David had been a man of sympathy; he had mourned when Saul was in ill health, putting on the weeds of sorrow for him as though he were a near and dear friend. His heart went into mourning for his sick master. "I humbled my soul with fasting." He prayed for his enemy, and made the sick man's case his own, pleading and confessing as if his own personal sin had brought on the evil. This showed a noble spirit in David, and greatly aggravated the baseness of those who now so cruelly persecuted him. "And my prayer returned into mine own bosom." Prayer is never lost: if it bless not those for whom intercession is made, it shall bless the intercessors. Clouds do not always descend in showers upon the same spot from which the vapours ascended, but they come down somewhere; and even so do supplications in some place or other yield their showers of mercy. If our dove find no rest for the sole of her foot among our enemies, it shall fly into our bosoms and bring an olive branch of peace in its mouth. How sharp is the contrast all through this Psalm between the righteous and his enemies! We must be earnest to keep the line of demarcation broad and clear.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They accused me to Saul of treachery and designs against his crown and life, and other crimes whereof I was wholly innocent and ignorant. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>False witnesses did rise up,....

The phraseology is that of a court; not that the Psalmist is to be thought of as actually put upon his trial. David was falsely and maliciously accused of treason and conspiracy against the king’s life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Why hear you men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?">1 Samuel 24:9</a>).

It is not probable that witnesses in a court are intended. David's calumniators accused him privately to Saul of "seeking his hurt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm">1 Samuel 24:9</a>), and so stirred Saul up against him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a>).

The clauses respecting the Angel of Jahve, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a>, are circumstantial clauses, viz., clauses defining the manner. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (giving, viz., them, the push that shall cause their downfall, equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; or &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>) is closely connected with the figure in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a>, and &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1501;, with the figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>; consequently it seems as though the original position of these two clauses respecting the Angel of Jahve had been disturbed; just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, the &#1506; strophe and the &#1508; strophe have changed their original places. It is the Angel, who took off Pharaoh's chariot wheels so that they drave them heavily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a>) that is intended here. The fact that this Angel is concerned here, where the point at issue is whether the kingship of the promise shall be destroyed at its very beginning or not, harmonises with the appearing of the &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1492; at all critical junctures in the course of the history of redemption. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, loca passim lubrica, is an intensive form of expression for &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; rof noisserp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a>.

In this latter passage the Angel of Jahve also appears in the midst of the conquerors who are pursuing the smitten foe, incarnate as it were in Deborah. </body></html>
