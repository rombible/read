Herein he was a type of Christ. David shows how tenderly he had behaved towards them in afflictions. We ought to mourn for the sins of those who do not mourn for themselves. We shall not lose by the good offices we do to any, how ungrateful soever they may be. Let us learn to possess our souls in patience and meekness like David, or rather after Christ's example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They rewarded me evil for good - They recompensed, or returned evil instead of good. The manner in which they did it he states in the following verses.<p>To the spoiling of my soul - Margin, "depriving." The Hebrew word means "the being forsaken," or "abandoned." The idea is, that owing to this conduct he was forsaken or abandoned by all in whom he might have put confidence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-14.

For the good David did in killing Goliath, and slaying his ten thousands of the Philistines, and thereby saving his king and country, Saul and his courtiers envied him, and sought to slay him: so our Lord Jesus Christ, for all the good he did to the Jews, by healing their bodies of diseases, and preaching the Gospel to them for the benefit of their souls, was rewarded with reproaches and persecutions, and at last with the shameful death of the cross; and in like manner are his people used; but this is an evil that shall not go unpunished; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a>. It is added, <p>to the spoiling of my soul; or "to the bereaving of it" (t); causing it to be fatherless; that is, to the bereaving it of its joy, peace, and comfort; so fatherless is put for comfortless, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>; or to the taking away of his soul, which being separated from the body, its companion is left alone, as one that is fatherless. <p>(t) "orbitatem", Montanus, Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Gejerus, Michaelis; so Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They rewarded me evil for good <i>to</i> the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> spoiling of my soul.</span><p>(k) To have taken from me all comfort and brought me into despair.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">They rewarded</span> &c.] Better, as R.V., they reward.

Among those who slandered him were persons with whose troubles he had sympathized, and for whom he had prayed with fasting when they were sick. His worst persecutor, Saul, admitted the charge here made. "Thou art more righteous than I," he said; "for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To the spoiling of my soul</span>; or, <span class="accented">the desolating of my soul.</span> The result of his enemies' machinations against him was to make him a fugitive and a wanderer, to separate him from the friend whom he tenderly loved, from his wife, his parents, and the greater part of his acquaintance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Throughout the next two strophes follow terrible imprecations. According to Frst and others the relation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1495;&#1508;&#1512; is like that of erblassen, to turn pale (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>), and err&#1510;then, to turn red, to blush. &#1489;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; has, however, no connection with &#1489;&#1493;&#1509;, nor has &#1495;&#1508;&#1512;, Arab. chfr, chmr, any connection with Arab. hmr, to be red; but, according to its radical notion, &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; means disturbari (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-11.htm">Psalm 6:11</a>), and &#1495;&#1508;&#1512;, obtegere, abscondere (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>). &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;, properly "let them be made to fall back" (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>). On the figure on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-14.htm">Psalm 83:14</a>. The clauses respecting the Angel of Jahve, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a>, are circumstantial clauses, viz., clauses defining the manner. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (giving, viz., them, the push that shall cause their downfall, equivalent to &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; or &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>) is closely connected with the figure in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">Psalm 35:6</a>, and &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1501;, with the figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>; consequently it seems as though the original position of these two clauses respecting the Angel of Jahve had been disturbed; just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, the &#1506; strophe and the &#1508; strophe have changed their original places. It is the Angel, who took off Pharaoh's chariot wheels so that they drave them heavily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a>) that is intended here. The fact that this Angel is concerned here, where the point at issue is whether the kingship of the promise shall be destroyed at its very beginning or not, harmonises with the appearing of the &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1492; at all critical junctures in the course of the history of redemption. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, loca passim lubrica, is an intensive form of expression for &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; rof noisserp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a>. Just as &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; recalls to mind <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>, so &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1501; recalls <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a>. In this latter passage the Angel of Jahve also appears in the midst of the conquerors who are pursuing the smitten foe, incarnate as it were in Deborah. </body></html>
