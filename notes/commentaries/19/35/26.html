David prays, My soul is in danger, Lord, rescue it; it belongs to thee the Father of spirits, therefore claim thine own; it is thine, save it! Lord, be not far from me, as if I were a stranger. He who exalted the once suffering Redeemer, will appear for all his people: the roaring lion shall not destroy their souls, any more than he could that of Christ, their Surety. They trust their souls in his hands, they are one with him by faith, are precious in his sight, and shall be rescued from destruction, that they may give thanks in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let them be ashamed ... - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a>.<p>That magnify themselves against me - Who seek to exalt themselves over me; to make themselves great by humbling and destroying me.
