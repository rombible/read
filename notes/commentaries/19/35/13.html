The context evidently implies something done for the benefit of the whilome friends for whom, in their sickness, the poet had worn sackcloth, and had fasted and adopted all the other signs of mourning. We must therefore set aside (1) the idea of <span class= "ital">fruitless </span>prayer, in spite of the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-13.htm" title="And if the house be worthy, let your peace come on it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.">Matthew 10:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-6.htm" title="And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on it: if not, it shall turn to you again.">Luke 10:6</a>. (2) The notion that the answer to the prayer came back to the psalmist himself, instead of to those for whom it was offered, must also be set aside. And (3) we must reject the notion of secret, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>silent prayer, in spite of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-23.htm" title="A wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.">Proverbs 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-14.htm" title="A gift in secret pacifies anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.">Proverbs 21:14</a>, since all the “outward and visible” signs of mourning are indicated, and the very object was to show sympathy and interest.<p>There remains (1) the literal, <span class= "ital">and my prayer turned upon my bosom, </span>referring to the posture described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm" title="I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourns for his mother.">Psalm 35:14</a>. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm" title="So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,">1Kings 18:42</a>, where, however, there is no express mention of prayer.) The words were, as it were, muttered into his bosom. This is the view of Ewald and Delitzsch, but seems prosaic. (2)The far more probable meaning, <span class= "ital">my prayer came back again and again to my bosom, i.e., </span>was repeated over and over again; just as we say, “the thought recurred to my mind.” (Comp. the common phrase for thoughts coming upon the heart, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, said the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.">Jeremiah 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, etc.) The Hebrew verb has this frequentative sense in one of its conjugations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/35.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm" title="But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.">Psalm 35:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">When they were sick — </span>Or in any other great misery; <span class="ital">my clothing was sackcloth — </span>Which was the habit of mourners. <span class="ital">I humbled — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">I afflicted, my soul with fasting — </span>And with compassion and fervent prayers for them; <span class="ital">and, </span>or <span class="ital">but, my prayer returned into mine own bosom — </span>My fastings and prayers did them no good, neither abated their malice, nor prevailed with God for them, so far as I desired; but returned to me without success, like a gift sent to an uncivil person, who disdainfully rejects it, and returns it to the giver.

Herein he was a type of Christ. David shows how tenderly he had behaved towards them in afflictions. We ought to mourn for the sins of those who do not mourn for themselves. We shall not lose by the good offices we do to any, how ungrateful soever they may be. Let us learn to possess our souls in patience and meekness like David, or rather after Christ's example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But as for me - The psalmist now contrasts their conduct with his own. He refers to the recollections of his past life, and to the acts of kindness which he had shown to them in thees of trouble, as more deeply marking the evils of their own conduct now.<p>When they were sick - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-25.htm">Job 30:25</a>. It would seem from this that the persons referred to, who now treated him with so much ingratitude, were those with whom he had been formerly intimately associated, or whom he had regarded as his personal friends, since it cannot be supposed that this deep sympathy would have been shown for those who were altogether strangers to him.<p>My clothing was sackcloth - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a>. The meaning is, that he showed the deepest sympathy in their distress by putting on the emblems of humiliation or mourning. It was also with reference to prayer in their behalf; and to fasting, that he put on these marks of grief. The idea is, that he did all that was understood to be connected with the deepest humiliation before God, and that would fit the mind for earnest prayer in their behalf. He felt that their restoration to health - that the preservation of their lives - depended on God, and he most earnestly and fervently pleaded in their behalf.<p>I humbled my soul with fasting - Margin, "afflicted;" so the Hebrew properly means. The word "soul" here is equivalent to "self;" I afflicted myself. He subjected himself to the pains of hunger, that he might be better prepared to offer fervent and acceptable prayer. Among the Hebrews fasting and prayer were much more closely connected than they are with Christians. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-21.htm">Matthew 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>.<p>And my prayer returned into mine own bosom - DeWette explains this as meaning, "I prayed with my head sunk on my bosom;" that is, with the head bowed down, so that the prayer which went out of Iris lips seemed to return again to his own bosom - that earnest prayer which one offers when the head is bowed with sorrow. A posture somewhat similar to this is referred to in the case of Elijah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42</a> : "And he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees." The posture of prayer with the head reclining toward the bosom is common among the Muslims, "Reland" de Religione Mohammetica, p. 87. Jarchi explains this as meaning that he sought the same for those who were now his enemies which he would for himself, or that he desired that that should come into his own bosom which he sought for them. Prof. Alexander supposes that this means, according to a traditional interpretation of the Jews, that he desired that the prayer which he offered might redound to his own advantage: "My prayer shall not be lost, it shall return in blessings to the heart which prompted it." There can be no reason to doubt that this is true "in fact;" and that prayer offered for others "does" bring back blessings to those who offer it. But to suppose that this was the "motive" in the case is to suppose that the psalmist was wholly selfish, and would take away the very point of his observation about his prayer - that it was dictated by the sincerest love for them and true sympathy for their sufferings. The most simple interpretation, therefore, is that which supposes that the prayer was offered under such a burden of grief on account of their sufferings, that his head sank on his bosom; or, in other words, that the prayer which was offered was such as is presented when the heart is most burdened and most sad. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. prayer &#8230; bosom&#8212;may denote either the posture&#8212;the head bowed&#8212;(compare 1Ki 18:42)&#8212;or, that the prayer was in secret.

According to Hupfeld, the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; signifies a wild, dreary, confused noise or crash, then devastation and destruction, a transition of meaning which - as follows from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; (cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;) as a name of the desolate steppe, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, a waste, emptiness, and from other indications - is solely brought about by transferring the idea of a desolate confusion of tones to a desolate confusion of things, without any intermediate notion of the crashing in of ruins. But it may be asked whether the reverse is not rather the case, viz., that the signification of a waste, desert, emptiness or void is the primary one, and the meaning that has reference to sound (cf. Arab. hwa&#770;, to gape, be empty; to drive along, fall down headlong, then also: to make a dull sound as of something falling, just like rumor from ruere, fragor (from frangi) the derived one. Both etymology (cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;, whence &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;) and the preponderance of other meanings, favour this latter view. Here the two significations are found side by side, inasmuch as &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; in the first instance means a waste  equals  devastation, desolation, and in the second a waste  equals  a heavy, dull sound, a rumbling (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;). In the Syriac version it is rendered: "into the pit which he has digged let him fall," as though it were &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; in the second instance instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;; and from his Hupfeld, with J. H. Michaelis, Stier, and others, is of opinion, that it must be rendered: "into the destruction which he himself has prepared let him fall." But this quam ipse paravit is not found in the text, and to mould the text accordingly would be a very arbitrary proceeding. </body></html>
