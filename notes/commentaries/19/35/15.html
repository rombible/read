The indignities and outrage which the Lord Jesus endured from the Jews seem to be plainly foretold in these two verses.

Herein he was a type of Christ. David shows how tenderly he had behaved towards them in afflictions. We ought to mourn for the sins of those who do not mourn for themselves. We shall not lose by the good offices we do to any, how ungrateful soever they may be.

That is, when reverses and troubles came upon me; when, in my journey of life, I seemed to stumble.<p>And gathered themselves together - Not to help me, but to oppose me, and to deride me.<p>Yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me - The word rendered "abjects" - &#1504;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;  ne&#772;kiym - has been very variously rendered. The Septuagint renders it: &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  mastiges, "scourges;" so the Vulgate, "flagella." Our translators evidently regarded it as meaning the low, the vile, the outcasts of society; but this idea is not necessarily implied in the Hebrew word. The word used here is derived from a verb - &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;  na&#770;ka&#770;h - which means to smite, to strike, to beat; and it would be correctly rendered in this place, "those smiting," or "beating:" - "the smiters." But probably the allusion is to the "tongue" - to those who, as it were, smite or beat with the tongue; that is, who rail or revile: those who are slanderous. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; Gesenius (Lexicon). Others have supposed that it means "lame;" that is, those who limp or halt - meaning that all classes of persons gathered themselves together. But probably the true idea is that which is expressed above, that he was surrounded by slanderers and revilers.<p>And I knew it not - Hebrew, "I knew not;" that is, I knew nothing of what they accused me of; I was wholly ignorant of the charges brought against me. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>.<p>They did tear me - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>. The idea here is that they "tore" or "rent" with words; or, as we say in English, they "tore him in pieces;" that is, they railed at, or reviled him, tearing his character in pieces.<p>And ceased not - It was not one act only; it was continuous and unceasing. They did it when alone; and they gathered themselves together to do it; they countenanced and encouraged one another. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15, 16.

Or "at my halting" (u), either by means of falling into sin; good men are subject to slips and falls, and that to the dislocating or breaking of their bones, which cause them to go halting all their days; wicked men watch for their halting, as Jeremiah's familiars did for his, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-10.htm">Jeremiah 20:10</a>; and rejoice at it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-16.htm">Psalm 38:16</a>; or by falling into some misfortune or calamity; hence we render it "adversity", and may design some affliction or other, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6</a>, at which wicked men rejoice; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a>; so David's enemies rejoiced at his afflictions; and the enemies of his son and antitype, the Lord Jesus Christ, were glad when Judas offered to betray him to them; more so when they had got him into their hands; and most of all when he was condemned and crucified: and so do the enemies of his people, as the Philistines sported with Samson when he was in his adversity, and as the antichristian party will rejoice and send gifts one to another when the two witnesses are slain; but the saints have a gracious God, who knows their souls in adversity; a sympathizing high priest, who is touched with a feeling of their infirmities; and fellow saints that are afflicted with them in all their afflictions, and bear a part of their burdens; <p>and gathered themselves together; not to pity him, but to insult him; not to help him in his distress, but to add to it; <p>yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me; mean persons, the refuse and scum of the earth; such as Job describes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>; the word may be rendered "smitten" (w), either in spirit, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>; they pretending sorrow of heart for his troubles; or rather smitten in body, in their feet, as Mephibosheth was; yet as lame as they were, and notwithstanding their lameness, they got together to rejoice at David's halting: or it may be best of all to understand it of their being smitten of God and afflicted; and the sense may be, that though the hand of God was upon them, this did not deter them from gathering together to insult David in his afflictions; some render the word "smiters" (x), that is, with their tongues, and so the Targum, "the wicked who smite with their words"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; and such sort of persons were they that gathered together against Christ: it is true indeed that some of them were men of rank and figure, were the princes of this world, as Herod and Pontius Pilate, and the Jewish rulers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>; but the greater part of them were the meaner sort of people; particularly the Roman soldiers that gathered about him, and sported with him in Pilate's hall, and that surrounded him with scoffs when upon the cross; these also were literally "smiters" of him, both with words and with their hands, and are so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>; <p>and I knew it not; David knew his enemies, or he could not have shown so much concern for them, as he did in the preceding verses; but either he knew not of their gathering together against him; until he saw them in great numbers about him; or he was not conscious to himself of any evil he had done them, that should be the reason of it; and this was the case of his son the Messiah, he who they were that gathered about him, even those that blindfolded him, and bid him prophesy who smote him; but he knew no sin he had done why he should be treated in the manner he was; <p>they did tear me, and ceased not; not their own garments, as some supply it, pretending great grief of heart for him; nor their mouth with laughing at him, as others; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-21.htm">Psalm 35:21</a>; but either his character and reputation, with hard sayings and reproachful words, or his flesh with blows; and this they did incessantly; and which was literally true of Christ, whose enemies tore his flesh, by plucking off the hair, by buffeting and scourging him, and by piercing his hands and his feet with nails, when they crucified him; and they ceased not, even after death, to pierce his side with a spear. <p>(u) "in claudicatione mea", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus, Gejerus, Michaelis; so Ainsworth.

The joy which he experiences in his soul shall throb through every member of his body and multiply itself, as it were, into a choir of praiseful voices. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; with a conjunctive accent and without Makkeph, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-7.htm">Proverbs 19:7</a> (not &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;, vid., the Masora in Baer's Psalterium p. 133), is to be read ca&#772;l (with &#1511;&#1502;&#1509; &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, opp. &#1511;&#1502;&#1509; &#1495;&#1496;&#1493;&#1507;) according to Kimchi.

The exclamation &#1502;&#1497; &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, where, according to the Masora, it is to be pointed &#1502;&#1497; &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498;, as Ben Naphtali also points it in the passage before us. The Dagesh, which is found in the former passage and is wanting here, sharpens and hardens at the same time; it requires that the expression should be emphatically pronounced (without there being any danger in this instance of its being slurred over); it does not serve to denote the closer connection, but to give it especial prominence. &#1495;&#1494;&#1511; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, stronger than he, is equivalent to: strong, whereas the other is weak, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-11.htm">Jeremiah 31:11</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>, &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, righteous, whereas he is ungodly.
