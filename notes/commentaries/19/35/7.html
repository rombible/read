This is a fruit of the old enmity in the seed of the serpent against the Seed of the woman. David in his afflictions, Christ in his sufferings, the church under persecution, and the Christian in the hour temptation, all beseech the Almighty to appear in their behalf, and to vindicate their cause. We are apt to justify uneasiness at the injuries men do us, by our never having given them cause to use us so ill; but this should make us easy, for then we may the more expect that God will plead our cause. David prayed to God to manifest himself in his trial. Let me have inward comfort under all outward troubles, to support my soul. If God, by his Spirit, witness to our spirits that he is our salvation, we need desire no more to make us happy. If God is our Friend, no matter who is our enemy. By the Spirit of prophecy, David foretells the just judgments of God that would come upon his enemies for their great wickedness. These are predictions, they look forward, and show the doom of the enemies of Christ and his kingdom. We must not desire or pray for the ruin of any enemies, except our lusts and the evil spirits that would compass our destruction. A traveller benighted in a bad road, is an expressive emblem of a sinner walking in the slippery and dangerous ways of temptation. But David having committed his cause to God, did not doubt of his own deliverance. The bones are the strongest parts of the body. The psalmist here proposes to serve and glorify God with all his strength. If such language may be applied to outward salvation, how much more will it apply to heavenly things in Christ Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>, note. This figure is derived from hunting. The idea is that of digging a pit or hole for a wild beast to fall into, with a net so concealed that the animal could not see it, and that might be suddenly drawn over him so as to secure him. The reference here is to plans that are laid to entrap and ruin others: plots that are concocted so as to secure destruction before one is aware. The psalmist says that, in his case, they had done this without "cause," or without any sufficient reason. He had done them no wrong; he had given them no show of excuse for their conduct.<p>Which without cause they have digged for my soul - For my life. That is, they have digged a pit into which I might fall, and into which they designed that I should fall, though I have never done anything to give them occasion thus to seek my destruction. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8. net in a pit&#8212;or, "pit of their net"&#8212;or, "net-pit," as "holy hill" for "hill of holiness" (Ps 2:6); a figure from hunting (Ps 7:15). Their imprecations on impenitent rebels against God need no vindication; His justice and wrath are for such; His mercy for penitents.

These expressions aggravate their sins, and signify that their persecution of him was not the effect of a midden passion, but of a deep and habitual hatred and malice, and of an evil design, carried on in a constant and continued course with deliberation, and cunning, and deceit, and that against his soul or life; for nothing less would satisfy them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,.... This is said in allusion to the custom of digging pits, and putting nets into them, for the catching of wild beasts; and covering them with straw or dust, or such like things, as Jarchi observes, that they might not be discerned; and which intends the secret and crafty methods taken by David's enemies to ensnare him and destroy him; though he had given them no cause to use him in such a manner; which is an aggravation of their sins, and a reason of the above imprecations, as well as of what follows: and in the same manner, and without any just cause, Christ and his members have been treated by wicked men, and therefore their damnation is just, and will be inevitable: <p>which without cause they have digged for my soul; which is added for further explanation's sake, and to aggravate their sin, and to show the justness of their punishment. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> without cause have they hid for me their net <i>in</i> a pit, <i>which</i> without cause they have digged for my soul.</span><p>(e) Showing that we may not call God to be a revenger but only for his glory, and when our cause is just.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

On the ultima-accentuation of &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>. Both &#1488;&#1514; are signs of the accusative. This is a more natural rendering here, where the psalmist implores God to subjugate his foes, than to regard &#1488;&#1514; as equivalent to &#1506;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a> with ib. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-2.htm">Job 10:2</a>); and, moreover, for the very same reason the expression in this instance is &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, (in the Kal, which otherwise only lends the part. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-2.htm">Psalm 56:2</a>., to the Niph. &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;) instead of the reciprocal form &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;. It is usually supposed that &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; means properly vorare, and war is consequently conceived of as a devouring of men; but the Arabic offers another primary meaning: to press close and compact (Niph. to one another), consequently &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; means a dense crowd, a dense bustle and tumult (cf. the Homeric &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). The summons to Jahve to arm, and that in a twofold manner, viz., with the &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; for warding off the hostile blow and &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-13.htm">Psalm 5:13</a>) which covers the body like a testudo - by which, inasmuch as it is impossible to hold both shields at the same time, the figure is idealised - is meant to express, that He is to make Himself felt by the foes, in every possible way, to their own confounding, as the unapproachable One. The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; (in the character of help turned towards me) is the so-called Beth essentiae,<p>(Note: The Hebrew Beth essentiae is used much more freely and extensively than the Arabic, which is joined exclusively to the predicate of a simple clause, where in our language the verb is "to be," and as a rule only to the predicate of negative clauses: laisa bi-hak&#305;&#770;mim, he is not wise, or laisa bi-l-hak&#305;&#770;mi, he is not the wise man. The predicate can accordingly be indeterminate or determinate. Moreover, in Hebrew, where this &#1489; is found with the predicate, with the complement of the subject, or even, though only as a solecism (vid., Gesenius' Thesaurus p. 175), with the subject itself, the word to which it is prefixed may be determinate, whether as an attribute determined by itself (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;), by a suffix (as above, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-5.htm">Psalm 146:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>), or even by the article. At all events no syntactic objection can be brought against the interpretations of &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, "in the quality of smoke," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>; cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-33.htm">Psalm 78:33</a>, and of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, "in the character of the soul," <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>.)<p>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">Proverbs 3:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a> (tanquam argentum), and frequently. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; has the same meaning as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>, viz., to bring forth, draw forth, to draw or unsheath (a sword); for as a sword is sheathed when not in use, so a spear is kept in the &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; (Odyss. i. 128). Even Parchon understands &#1505;&#1490;&#1512; to mean a weapon; and the word &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, in Herodotus, Xenophon, and Strabo, a northern Asiatic, more especially a Scythian, battle-axe, has been compared here; <p>(Note: Probably one and the same word with the Armenian sakr, to which are assigned the (Italian) meanings mannaja, scure, brando ferro, in Ciakciak's Armenian Lexicon; cf. Lagarde's Gesammelte Abhandlungen, 1866, S. 203.)<p>but the battle-axe was not a Hebrew weapon, and &#1505;&#1490;&#1512;, which, thus defectively written, has the look of an imperative, also gives the best sense when so taken (lxx &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Targ. &#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;), viz., close, i.e., cut off, interclude scil. viam. The word has Dech, because &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1497;, "casting Thyself against my persecutors," belongs to both the preceding summonses. Dachselt rightly directs attention to the similar sequence of the accents in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a>. The Mosaic figure of Jahve as a man of war (&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>.) is worked out here with brilliant colours, under the impulse of a wrathful spirit. But we see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-3.htm">Psalm 35:3</a> what a spiritual meaning, nevertheless, the whole description is intended to convey. In God's intervention, thus manifested in facts, he would gladly hear His consolatory utterance to himself. The burden of his cry is that God's love may break through the present outward appearance of wrath and make itself felt by him. </body></html>
