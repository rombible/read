This is a fruit of the old enmity in the seed of the serpent against the Seed of the woman. David in his afflictions, Christ in his sufferings, the church under persecution, and the Christian in the hour temptation, all beseech the Almighty to appear in their behalf, and to vindicate their cause. We are apt to justify uneasiness at the injuries men do us, by our never having given them cause to use us so ill; but this should make us easy, for then we may the more expect that God will plead our cause. David prayed to God to manifest himself in his trial. Let me have inward comfort under all outward troubles, to support my soul. If God, by his Spirit, witness to our spirits that he is our salvation, we need desire no more to make us happy. If God is our Friend, no matter who is our enemy. By the Spirit of prophecy, David foretells the just judgments of God that would come upon his enemies for their great wickedness. These are predictions, they look forward, and show the doom of the enemies of Christ and his kingdom. We must not desire or pray for the ruin of any enemies, except our lusts and the evil spirits that would compass our destruction. A traveller benighted in a bad road, is an expressive emblem of a sinner walking in the slippery and dangerous ways of temptation. But David having committed his cause to God, did not doubt of his own deliverance. The bones are the strongest parts of the body. The psalmist here proposes to serve and glorify God with all his strength. If such language may be applied to outward salvation, how much more will it apply to heavenly things in Christ Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let them be confounded - That is, Let them, through Thy gracious interposition in my behalf, be so entirely overcome and subdued that they shall be "ashamed" that they ever made the effort to destroy me; let them see so manifestly that God is on my side that they will be covered with confusion for having opposed one who was so entirely the object of the divine protection and care.

That they contain nothing but a prayer to God, that he would accomplish his own threatenings, and execute his own law of retaliation, of <span class="ital">eye for eye, and tooth for tooth</span>, and so bring upon them the evils which they designed against him; which also was of great and good use, both to glorify God’s justice, and to warn and reform other sinners by the terror of their example. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

This petition, and what follows, which seem to be by way of imprecation, are to be considered as prophecies of what would be, and as expressions of faith that so it should be; and are not to be drawn into examples, and to be imitated by private persons; nor are they contrary to those evangelical rules, which require men to love their enemies, and pray for them; to give place to wrath, and not meditate vengeance, nor take it: and so it was with David's enemies. Saul, who hunted after his soul or life, to take it away, was filled with shame and confusion, when David, having cut off the skirt of his garment, held it up to him; by which he was convinced that his life was in his hands, and he did not take it away, though he was seeking after his: and so it will fare with the enemies of Christ, the Jews; who sought to take away his life and did take it away, when they shall see him come in the clouds of heaven, whom they have pierced; and in like manner will it be with the enemies of all his people, whom nothing will content but their lives, when they shall see the lambs they have worried and butchered on Christ's right hand, and they on the left; and to the sheep said, Come, ye blessed; and to them, Go, ye cursed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>; <p>let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt; as Saul did David's, even when he made the most specious show of affection and respect unto him, as well as when he more openly persecuted him; and more than once was he turned back with shame, and departed home; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-22.htm">1 Samuel 24:22</a>. The Jews, that came to apprehend Christ, together with the Roman soldiers, and who had devised and intended his hurt, went backward, and fell to the ground with shame and confusion, when, having asked them who they sought, and they had replied, told them he was the person; and how often has it been, that when wicked men have devised, deceitful matters against the members of Christ, that their counsel has been carried headlong, they have not been able to perform their enterprises; a hook has been put into their nose, and a bridle in their jaws, and they have been turned back the way they came, with shame and disgrace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

The prepositions &#1488;&#1500; and &#1489;&#1468;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, are a well considered interchange of expression: the former, of gracious inclination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>), the latter, of hostile intention or determining, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-8.htm">Job 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>, after the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>. The evil doers are overwhelmed by the power of destruction that proceeds from the countenance of Jahve, which is opposed to them, until there is not the slightest trace of their earthly existence left. The subjects to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> are not, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-17.htm">Psalm 107:17-19</a>, the &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506; (evil doers), since the indispensable characteristic of penitence is in this instance wanting, but the &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (the righteous). Probably the &#1508; strophe stood originally before the &#1506; strophe, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2.htm">Lamentations 2-4</a> the &#1508; precedes the &#1506; (Hitzig). In connection with the present sequence of the thoughts, the structure of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a> is just like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a> : Clamant et Dominus audit  equals  si qui (quicunque) clamant. What is meant is the cry out of the depth of a soul that despairs of itself. Such crying meets with a hearing with God, and in its realisation, an answer that bears its own credentials. "The broken in heart" are those in whom the egotistical, i.e., self-loving life, which encircles its own personality, is broken at the very root; "the crushed or contrite (&#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;, with a changeable a&#772;, after the form &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;) in spirit" are those whom grievous experiences, leading to penitence, of the false eminence to which their proud self-consciousness has raised them, have subdued and thoroughly humbled. To all such Jahve is nigh, He preserves them from despair, He is ready to raise up in them a new life upon the ruins of the old and to cover or conceal their infinitive deficiency; and, they, on their part, being capable of receiving, and desirous of, salvation, He makes them partakers of His salvation. It is true these afflictions come upon the righteous, but Jahve rescues him out of them all, &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1503; (the same enallage generis as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-19.htm">Ruth 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>). He is under the most special providence, "He keepeth all his bones, not one of them (ne unum quidem) is broken" - a pictorial exemplification of the thought that God does not suffer the righteous to come to the extremity, that He does not suffer him to be severed from His almighty protecting love, nor to become the sport of the oppressors. Nevertheless we call to mind the literal fulfilment which these words of the psalmist received in the Crucified One; for the Old Testament prophecy, which is quoted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-33.htm">John 19:33-37</a>, may be just as well referred to our Psalm as to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>. Not only the Paschal lamb, but in a comparative sense even every affliction of the righteous, is a type. Not only is the essence of the symbolism of the worship of the sanctuary realised in Jesus Christ, not only is the history of Israel and of David repeated in Him, not only does human suffering attain in connection with Him its utmost intensity, but all the promises given to the righteous are fulfilled in Him &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;; because He is the righteous One in the most absolute sense, the Holy One of God in a sense altogether unique (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>). - The righteous is always preserved from extreme peril, whereas evil (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;) slays (&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514; stronger than &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;) the ungodly: evil, which he loved and cherished, becomes the executioner's power, beneath which he falls. And they that hate the righteous must pay the penalty. Of the meanings to incur guilt, to feel one's self guilty, and to undergo punishment as being guilty, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-13.htm">1 Samuel 14:13</a>) has the last in this instance. </body></html>
