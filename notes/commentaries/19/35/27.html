David prays, My soul is in danger, Lord, rescue it; it belongs to thee the Father of spirits, therefore claim thine own; it is thine, save it! Lord, be not far from me, as if I were a stranger. He who exalted the once suffering Redeemer, will appear for all his people: the roaring lion shall not destroy their souls, any more than he could that of Christ, their Surety. They trust their souls in his hands, they are one with him by faith, are precious in his sight, and shall be rescued from destruction, that they may give thanks in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let them shout for joy - That is, Let me be delivered; let my friends see that God is on my side, and that they have occasion to rejoice in his merciful interposition in my behalf.<p>That favor my righteous cause - Margin, as in Hebrew, "my righteousness."

The cause of David was a righteous cause, he having done no iniquity, or anything criminal against Saul his enemy, who persecuted him; and there were some that favoured his cause, as Jonathan, Saul's son, and a few others of rank and figure; but the greatest part were mean and despicable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>; and so the cause of Christ and of his people, which is one, is a righteous cause, which no one need to be ashamed of, and is worth suffering for; though those that favour it are for the most part the poor and base and weak things of the world: but when this cause prospers they rejoice and are glad, as they do at the happiness of every particular saint; for if one member is honoured, all the rest rejoice with it; <p>yea, let them say continually, the Lord be magnified; let them continually ascribe greatness, give honour and glory, to him, <p>which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant; meaning either himself, who was a servant of the Lord, not only by creation, but by grace; and who had his times both of temporal and spiritual prosperity; which were owing to the good will and pleasure of God, and to the delight and complacency he had in him, being a man after his own heart, raised up to fulfil his will; and since this prosperity did not arise from any desert of his, he would have all the glory of it given to God: or else he intends the Messiah, his antitype, who, as Mediator, is the servant of the Lord; of his choosing, calling, and sending; whose commands he diligently and faithfully obeyed; from whom he had his work, and also his reward: his prosperity lies in the work of redemption succeeding in his hands; in his exaltation at the right hand of God; and in the spread of his Gospel in the world, and the efficacy of it to the conviction of sinners; and in the establishment and increase of his kingdom and interest; on which account the Lord's name is to be magnified and glorified, who delights in him as his servant, and in his prosperity; and the rather this is to be done, since the saints have an interest in him as a Prince and a Saviour: or anyone of the servants of the Lord may be understood; or however it is applicable to anyone of them, who, through the power of divine grace upon them, are made willing to serve the Lord with reverence and godly fear; who are his Hephzibah, in whom is all his delight and pleasure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>; who rejoices over them to do them good: and hence flows all the spiritual prosperity they enjoy, on account of which glory is to be given to God by them and all the saints that know it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let them shout for joy, and be glad, <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the <span class="cverse3">{y}</span> prosperity of his servant.</span><p>(x) That at least favour my right, though they are not able to help me.<p>(y) He exhorts the Church to praise God for the deliverance of his servants, and for the destruction of his adversaries.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>.

This they will do, partly, out of sympathy; partly because their own interests are bound up with those of their leader. Had Saul captured David when he "hunted him upon the mountains," the fate of David's followers would have been death or exile. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the peace of his servant.</span> God desires that David's present troubles should cease, and that he should enjoy a time of rest and tranquillity. This was granted him, to some extent, at Ziklag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-4.htm">1 Samuel 27:4-7</a>), but more fully when he came into his kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>I the third part, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a> the description of the godlessness of his enemies is renewed; but the soul of the praying psalmist has become more tranquil, and accordingly the language also is more clear and moves on with its accustomed calmness. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; and &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; are genitives, having an attributive sense (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-23.htm">2 Samuel 22:23</a>). The verb &#1511;&#1512;&#1509; signifies both to pinch  equals  nip, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm">Job 33:6</a> (cf. the Arabic karada, to cut off), and to pinch together, compress  equals  to wink, generally used of the eyes, but also of the lips, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-30.htm">Proverbs 16:30</a>, and always as an insidiously malicious gesture. &#1488;&#1500; rules over both members of the verse as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>, and frequently. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a> is the word for whatever proceeds from good intentions and aims at the promotion or restoration of a harmonious relationship. &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (from &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, cf. &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-3.htm">Zephaniah 2:3</a>, &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-4.htm">Psalm 83:4</a>) are those who quietly and unostentatiously walk in the ways of God. Against such they devise mischievous, lying slanders and accusations. And with wide-opened mouth, i.e., haughty scorn, they cry, as they carouse in sight of the misfortune of those they have persecuted: now we have that which we have longed to see. &#1492;&#1488;&#1495; (composed of &#1492;&#1492;&#1468; and &#1488;&#1495;) is a cry of joy, and more especially of malignant joy at another's hurt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-3.htm">Ezekiel 25:3</a>). </body></html>
