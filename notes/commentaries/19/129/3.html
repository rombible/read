But Dr. J. G. Wettstein, in his excursus at the end of Delitzsch’s Commentary, explains the <span class= "ital">ma’an </span>to be the strip of ground which the ploughman takes in hand at one time, and round which consequently at the end of each furrow the plough turns. Delitzsch’s “furrow-strip,” therefore, more exactly reproduces the word, though here doubtless it is used with a poetic freedom and may be translated <span class= "ital">furrow. </span>The double image, suggesting the lash given to a slave, and at the same time the actual and terrible imprints of oppression left on the country as well as the race, is as striking as poetry ever produced. It, in fact, combines two separate prophetic figures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm" title="From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.">Isaiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm" title="But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict you; which have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and you have laid your body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.">Isaiah 51:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/129.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/129-3.htm" title="The plowers plowed on my back: they made long their furrows....">Psalm 129:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">The ploughers ploughed upon my back </span>— They not only threw me down and trod me under foot, but cruelly wounded, mangled, and tormented me, and had no more pity upon me than the plough-man hath upon the earth which he cuts at his pleasure.

The direct allusion would seem to be to stripes inflicted on the back, as if a plow had been made to pass over it; and the meaning is, that they had been subjected to sufferings as slaves or criminals were when the lash cut deep into the flesh. Probably the immediate thing in the mind of the psalmist was the hard bondage of the children of Israel in Egypt, when they were subjected to all the evils of servitude.<p>They made long their furrows - On my back. The word used here, and rendered "made long" - &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;  'a&#770;rak, means to make long, to prolong, to extend in a right line, and it may be used either in the sense of making long as to extent or space, or making long in regard to time, prolonging. The latter would seem to be the meaning here, as it is difficult to see in what sense it could be said that stripes inflicted on the back could be made long. They might, however, be continued and repeated; the sufferings might be prolonged sufferings as well as deep. It was a work of long-continued oppression and wrong. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/129.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

"Sinners", as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions, render it; such that plough iniquity, and sow wickedness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; which may be understood of their carrying Israel captive, when they put yokes and bonds upon their necks, as upon oxen when they plough, as Arama interprets it; or it may design the destruction of their high places, signified by the back, such as the temple, the royal palace, and houses of their nobles, burnt with fire; yea, it was predicted that Zion should be ploughed as a field, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; and the Jews say that Turnus Rufus, the Roman general, as they call him, did plough up Jerusalem. The Syriac version is, "they whipped" their whips or scourges; with which many of the Israelites were scourged in the times of the Maccabees, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36</a>. And the Messiah himself, who gave his back to the smiters, and was buffeted and scourged by them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>; and many of his apostles and followers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17</a>.

Plowers have plowed <span class="ital">upon my dock</span>] A bold metaphor for cruel maltreatment. Israel is imagined as thrown prostrate upon its face, while the remorseless foe drives the plough up and down over it, brutally lacerating its back. Cp. the similar figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm" title="But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict you; which have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and you have laid your body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.">Isaiah 51:23</a>. The use of the metaphor may have been facilitated by the common identification of the people with the land, and it may be intended to suggest the thought of the slave’s back torn and furrowed by the lash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm" title="I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.">Isaiah 50:6</a>). We are reminded also of <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>, and of the story that a plough was driven over the site of the Temple by Terentius Rufus after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus, and again by Hadrian after the suppression of Bar Cocheba’s revolt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they made long their furrows</span>] According to Delitzsch, the word means more exactly <span class="ital">the strip of land which is ploughed at one time</span>, but the meaning will be the same: they did their cruel work thoroughly and spared nothing.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/129.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The plowers plowed upon my back</span>. A strong metaphor, which does not elsewhere occur. The idea is perhaps taken from the cruel treatment of captives in those days, who, in certain cases, were "put under saws and harrows of iron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>), or, as it is elsewhere expressed, "threshed with threshing instruments of iron" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They made long their furrows</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

To support one's self by one's own labour is a duty which even a Paul did not wish to avoid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>), and so it is a great good fortune (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1498; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-71.htm">Psalm 119:71</a>) to eat the produce of the labour of one's own hands (lxx , &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, or according to an original reading, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;);<p>(Note: The fact that the &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; of the lxx here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-20.htm">Proverbs 31:20</a>, is intended to refer to the hands is noted by Theodoret and also by Didymus (in Rosenmuller): &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (i.e., per synecdochen partis pro toto), &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;.)<p>For he who can make himself useful to others and still is also independent of them, he eats the bread of blessing which God gives, which is sweeter than the bread of charity which men give. In close connection with this is the prosperity of a house that is at peace and contented within itself, of an amiable and tranquil and hopeful (rich in hope) family life. "Thy wife (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, found only here, for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;) is as a fruit-producing vine." &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, with the Jod of the root retained, like &#1489;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-16.htm">Lamentations 1:16</a>. The figure of the vine is admirably suited to the wife, who is a shoot or sprig of the husband, and stands in need of the man's support as the vine needs a stick or the wall of a house (pergula). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; does not belong to the figure, as Kimchi is of opinion, who thinks of a vine starting out of the room and climbing up in the open air outside. What is meant is the angle, corner, or nook (&#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, in relation to things and artificial, equivalent to the natural &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;), i.e., the background, the privacy of the house, where the housewife, who is not to be seen much out of doors, leads a quiet life, entirely devoted to the happiness of her husband and her family. The children springing from such a nobel vine, planted around the family table, are like olive shoots or cuttings; cf. in Euripides, Medea, 1098: &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, and Herc.
