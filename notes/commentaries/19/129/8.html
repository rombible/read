No wise man will pray the Lord to bless these mowers or reapers. And when we remember how Jesus arose and reigns; how his people have been supported, like the burning but unconsumed bush, we shall not fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/129.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord,... - As in a harvest-field, where persons passing by express their joy and gratitude that their neighbors are reaping an abundant harvest. The phrase "The blessing of the Lord be upon you," was expressive of good wishes; of pious congratulation; of a hope of success and prosperity; as when we say, "God be with you;" or, "God bless you." The meaning here is, that such language would never be used in reference to the grass or grain growing on the house-top, since it would never justify a wish of that kind: it would be ridiculous and absurd to apply such language to anyone who should be found gathering up that dry; and withered, and worthless grass. So the psalmist prays that it may be in regard to all who hate Zion <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/129-5.htm">Psalm 129:5</a>, that they may have no such prosperity as would be represented by a growth of luxuriant and abundant grain; no such prosperity as would be denoted by the reaper and the binder of sheaves gathering in such a harvest; no such prosperity as would be indicated by the cheerful greeting and congratulation of neighors who express their gratification and their joy at the rich and abundant harvest which has crowned the labors of their friend, by the prayer that God would bless him.<p>We bless you in the name of the Lord - Still the language of pious joy and gratification addressed by his neighbors to him who was reaping his harvest. All this is simply language drawn from common life, uttering a prayer that the enemies of Zion might be "confounded and turned back" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-5.htm">Psalm 129:5</a>; a prayer that they might not be successful in their endeavors to destroy the Church. Such a prayer cannot but be regarded as proper and right. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/129.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

As was usual with passengers, when they went by where mowers, and reapers, and binders, were at work in the field in harvest time; who used to wish the presence and blessing of God with them, and upon their labours; and who returned the salutation, as may be seen in Boaz and his reapers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>; <p>we bless you in the name of the Lord; which is either a continuation of the blessing of the passengers, or the answer of the reapers to them; so the Targum, <p>"nor do they answer them, "we bless you",'' &amp;c. <p>The sense is, that those wicked men would have no blessing on them, from God nor men; that no God speed would be wished them; but that they were like the earth, that is covered with briers and thorns; which is nigh unto cursing, and its end to be burned. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/129.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD <i>be</i> upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.</span><p>(d) That is, the wicked will perish, and none will pass for them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/129.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">The blessing of Jehovah be upon you</span> is the friendly greeting of the passers-by to the reapers at their work: <span class="ital">we bless you in the name of Jehovah</span> may be simply an emphatic repetition of the greeting (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-26.htm" title="Blessed be he that comes in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.">Psalm 118:26</a>): or it may be, as the Targ. takes it, inserting <span class="ital">and they do not answer them</span>, the reapers’ reply.
