And so in the next verse, instead of <span class="ital">Let them be, </span>read, <span class="ital">They shall be as grass upon the house tops — </span>Which there were flat, and therefore more capable of grass, or green corn, growing between the stones than ours are; <span class="ital">which withereth, </span>&c. — Which, having no deep root, never comes to maturity. And so all their designs shall be abortive. Thus the enemies of God’s church wither of themselves, and stay not till they are rooted out by the judgments of God. <span class="ital">Neither do they which go by — </span>According to the ancient and laudable custom of saluting and praying for the prosperity of harvest labours; <span class="ital">say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you, </span>&c. — Which was a usual salutation given by passengers to reapers, as we see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-4.htm" title="And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless you.">Ruth 2:4</a>. If, in a similar way, we acknowledge God’s providence, testify our good-will to our neighbours, and commend their industry, our kind wishes will be accepted as pious ejaculations, if they come from devout and upright hearts. But religious expressions, being sacred things, must never be made use of in light and ludicrous actions. Mowing the grass on the house-top would be a jest, and therefore those that have a reverence for the name of God will not prostitute to such an action those forms of salutation which savour of devotion; for holy things must not be jested with. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/129.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>129:5-8 While God's people shall flourish as the loaded palm-tree, or the green and fruitful olive, their enemies shall wither as the grass upon the house-tops, which in eastern countries are flat, and what grows there never ripens; so it is with the designs of God's enemies. No wise man will pray the Lord to bless these mowers or reapers. And when we remember how Jesus arose and reigns; how his people have been supported, like the burning but unconsumed bush, we shall not fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/129.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let them all be confounded and turned back ... - This might be rendered in the indicative, "they are ashamed," but the connection seems to require the rendering in our version. It is a prayer that God would now interpose as he had done in former times, and that he would cause all the haters of Zion to be put to shame as formerly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/129.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

Or "ashamed": as all the enemies of God's people will be sooner or later, either in this world, or however when Christ shall come in the clouds of heaven; or let them be disappointed of their views, aims, and ends, when they will be confounded, as disappointed persons are; <p>and turned back; from pursuing their designs and accomplishing them; as the Assyrian monarch was, who had a hook put into his nose, and a bridle in his lips, and was turned back by the way he came, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a>; <p>that hate Zion; the inhabitants of Zion, who are called out of the world, and separated from the men of it, and therefore hated by them; the King of Zion, the Messiah, whom they will not have to reign over them; the doctrines of the Gospel, the word that comes out of Zion, to which they are utter enemies; and the laws and ordinances of Zion, the discipline of God's house, which they cannot bear to be under and submit unto. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/129.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/129.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. Put to shame and turned backward<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Shall be all that hate Zion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is difficult to decide whether these words are a prayer, as most Versions and commentators render them; or an expression of faith, that Israel’s enemies will be foiled and repulsed in the present crisis as they were in the past. On the whole the latter explanation seems best. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-10.htm" title="Let all my enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.">Psalm 6:10</a>. <span class="ital">The haters of Zion</span> were such as Sanballat and Tobiah, who “were grieved exceedingly” when Nehemiah came “to seek the welfare of the children of Israel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm" title="When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.">Nehemiah 2:10</a>), and all who joined them in endeavouring to prevent the restoration of Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5–8</span>.

The main verbs are in the future tense, but may be taken as expressive either of a wish or of a confident expectation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/128.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Pointing back to this charming picture of family life, the poet goes on to say: behold, for thus  equals  behold, thus is the man actually blessed who fears Jahve. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; confirms the reality of the matter of fact to which the &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; points. The promissory future in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/128-5.htm">Psalm 128:5</a> is followed by imperatives which call upon the God-fearing man at once to do that which, in accordance with the promises, stands before him as certain. &#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-3.htm">Psalm 134:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; gives a designed indefiniteness to the first member of the combination. Every blessing the individual enjoys comes from the God of salvation, who has taken up His abode in Zion, and is perfected in participation in the prosperity of the holy city and of the whole church, of which it is the centre. A New Testament song would here open up the prospect of the heavenly Jerusalem. But the character of limitation to this present world that is stamped upon the Old Testament does not admit of this. The promise refers only to a present participation in the well-being of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-15.htm">Zechariah 8:15</a>) and to long life prolonged in one's children's children; and in this sense calls down intercessorily peace upon Israel in all its members, and in all places and all ages. </body></html>
