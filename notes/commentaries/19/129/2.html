But the church has been always graciously delivered. Christ has built his church upon a rock. And the Lord has many ways of disabling wicked men from doing the mischief they design against his church. The Lord is righteous in not suffering Israel to be ruined; he has promised to preserve a people to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/129.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Many a time ... - This repetition is designed to fix the thoughts on the fact, and to impress it on the mind. The mind dwells on the fact as important in its bearing on the present occasion or emergency. The idea is, that it is no new thing to be thus afflicted. It has often occurred. It is a matter of long and almost constant experience. Our enemies have often attempted to destroy us, but in vain. What we experience now we have often experienced, and when thus tried we have been as often delivered, and have nothing now therefore to fear. We are not to regard it as a strange thing that we are now afflicted; and we are not to be discouraged or disheartened as if our enemies could overcome us, for they have often tried it in vain. He who has protected us heretofore can protect us still. He who defended us before can defend us now, and the past furnishes an assurance that be will defend us if it is best that we should be protected. It does much to support us in affliction if we can recall to mind the consolations which we had in former trials, and can avail ourselves of the result of past experience in supporting us now.<p>Yet they have not prevailed against me - They have never been able to overcome us. We were safe then in the divine hands; we shall be safe in the same hands now. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/129.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. prevailed&#8212;literally, "been able," that is, to accomplish their purpose against me (Ps 13:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/129.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/129.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth,....

To support one's self by one's own labour is a duty which even a Paul did not wish to avoid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>), and so it is a great good fortune (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1498; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-71.htm">Psalm 119:71</a>) to eat the produce of the labour of one's own hands (lxx , &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, or according to an original reading, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;);<p>(Note: The fact that the &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; of the lxx here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-20.htm">Proverbs 31:20</a>, is intended to refer to the hands is noted by Theodoret and also by Didymus (in Rosenmuller): &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (i.e., per synecdochen partis pro toto), &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;.)<p>For he who can make himself useful to others and still is also independent of them, he eats the bread of blessing which God gives, which is sweeter than the bread of charity which men give. In close connection with this is the prosperity of a house that is at peace and contented within itself, of an amiable and tranquil and hopeful (rich in hope) family life. "Thy wife (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, found only here, for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;) is as a fruit-producing vine." &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, with the Jod of the root retained, like &#1489;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-16.htm">Lamentations 1:16</a>. The figure of the vine is admirably suited to the wife, who is a shoot or sprig of the husband, and stands in need of the man's support as the vine needs a stick or the wall of a house (pergula). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1498; does not belong to the figure, as Kimchi is of opinion, who thinks of a vine starting out of the room and climbing up in the open air outside. What is meant is the angle, corner, or nook (&#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, in relation to things and artificial, equivalent to the natural &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;), i.e., the background, the privacy of the house, where the housewife, who is not to be seen much out of doors, leads a quiet life, entirely devoted to the happiness of her husband and her family. The children springing from such a nobel vine, planted around the family table, are like olive shoots or cuttings; cf. in Euripides, Medea, 1098: &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, and Herc. Fur. 839: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. thus fresh as young layered small olive-trees and thus promising are they. </body></html>
