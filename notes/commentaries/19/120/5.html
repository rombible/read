It appears again in the prophet <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:">Ezekiel 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm" title="Therefore, you son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:">Ezekiel 39:1</a>. The only reason for suspecting the accuracy of this identification is the remoteness from <span class= "ital">Kedar, </span>who were a nomad tribe of Arabia. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,">Genesis 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-5.htm" title="I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.">Song of Solomon 1:5</a>.) But in the absence of any other indication of the motive for the mention of these tribes here, this very remoteness affords a sufficiently plausible one; or they may be types of savage life, selected the one from the north, and the other from the south, as poetry dictated. It is quite possible that the circumstances amid which the poet wrote made it necessary for him to veil in this way his allusion to powerful tribes, from whose violence the nation was suffering. At all events, the two concluding verses leave no doubt that some troubled state of affairs, in which the choice of courses was not easy, and affecting the whole nation. not an individual, is here presented.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/120.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm" title="Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!">Psalm 120:5</a>. </span><span class="ital">Wo is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar — Mesech </span>and <span class="ital">Kedar </span>are two sorts of people often mentioned in Scripture, and reckoned among the barbarous nations.

It is like living in Mesech or in Kedar.<p>That I sojourn - The word used here does not denote a permanent abode, but it usually refers to a temporary lodging, as when one is a traveler, a pilgrim, a stranger, and is under a necessity of passing a night in a strange land on his way to the place of his destination. The trouble or discomfort here referred to is not that which would result from having his home there, or abiding there permanently, but of feeling that he was a stranger, and would be exposed to all the evils and inconveniences of a stranger among such a people. A man who resided in a place permanently might be subject to fewer inconveniences than if he were merely a temporary lodger among strangers.<p>In Mesech - The Septuagint and Vulgate render this, "that my sojourning is protracted." The Hebrew word - &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;  meshek - means, properly "drawing," as of seed "scattered regularly along the furrows" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-6.htm">Psalm 126:6</a>; and then possession, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>. The people of Meshech or the Moschi, were a barbarous race inhabiting the Moschian regions between Iberia, Armenia, and Colchis. Meshech was a son of Japheth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-5.htm">1 Chronicles 1:5</a>. The name is connected commonly with "Tubal," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a> : "Tubal and Meshech they were thy merchants." <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a> : "I am against ... the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal," Herodotus (iii. 94; vii. 78) connects them with the Tibarenes. The idea here is, that they were a barbarous, savage, uncivilized people. They dwelt outside of Palestine, beyond what were regarded as the borders of civilization; and the word seems to have had a signification similar to the names Goths, Vandals, Turks, Tartars, Cossacks, in later times. It is not known that they were particularly remarkable for slander or calumny; but the meaning is that they were barbarous and savage - and to dwell among slanderers and revilers seemed to the psalmist to be like dwelling among a people who were strangers to all the rules and principles of civilized society.<p>That I dwell in the tents of Kedar - The word Kedar means properly dark skin, a darkskinned man. Kedar was a son of Ishmael <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>, and hence, the name was given to an Arabian tribe descended from him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>. The idea here also is, that to dwell among slanderers was like dwelling among barbarians and savages. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/120.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

But their nurses are not here to be understood properly, (for we do not read that either David or the Israelites in the Babylonish captivity dwelt in their lands,) but only metaphorically, as the ungodly Israelites are called Sodom and Gomorrah, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm" title="Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:10</a></span>, and Amorites and Hittithes, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD to Jerusalem; Your birth and your nativity is of the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and your mother an Hittite.">Ezekiel 16:3</a>,45</span>, and as in common speech among us, men of an evil character are called Turks or Jews. And so he explains himself in the next verse by this description of them, him or them that hated peace, although David sought peace with them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-7.htm" title="I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.">Psalm 120:7</a></span>. And so he speaks either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of the Philistines, among whom he sojourned for a time. But he did not seek peace with them, but sought their ruin, as the event showed; nor did they wage war against him, whilst he lived peaceably among them. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The courtiers and soldiers of Saul, and the generality of the Israelites, who, to curry favour with Saul, sought David’s ruin, and that many times by treachery and pretences of friendship; of which he oft complains in this book; whom as he elsewhere calls <span class="ital">heathen</span>, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-5.htm" title="You have rebuked the heathen, you have destroyed the wicked, you have put out their name for ever and ever.">Psalm 9:5</a> 59:5</span>, it is not strange if he compares them here to the savage Arabians. And amongst such persons David was oft forced to sojourn in Saul’s time, and with them he sought peace by all ways possible; but they hated peace, and the more he pursued peace, the more eagerly did they prosecute the war, as it here follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/120.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech,.... Meshech was a son of Japheth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>; whose posterity are thought by some to be the Muscovites (z) and Scythians, a barbarous sort of people: Mesech is frequently mentioned with Tubal and his brother, and with Gog and Magog, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2</a>; the Targum here calls them Asiatics. Rather the Cappadocians, according to Josephus (a); and Strabo (b) makes mention of a city of theirs, called Mazaca: and the rather, since they are mentioned with the Kedarenes, or Arabian Scenites, and were nearer to the land of Judea than the former; <p>that I dwell in the tents of Kedar; Kedar was a son of Ishmael, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>; whose posterity were Arabians, as the Targum here renders it; and Suidas (c) says, they dwelt not far from Babylon, when he wrote; they lived a pastoral life, and dwelt in tents: Pliny (d) makes mention of Arabs, called Cedrei; and also of Scenite Arabs, from the tents they dwelt in, which they could remove from place to place for the sake of pasturage. And among these David dwelt, when in the wilderness of Paran, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1</a>; though some think David never dwelt among any of those people, but among such who were like unto them for ignorance, idolatry, and barbarity. Some render the words, "woe is me, that I sojourn so long, dwelling as in the tents of Kedar" (e); as when he was among the Philistines and Moabites; nay, even he may compare his own people to those, many of whom it was as disagreeable dwelling with as with these: and we find Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, speaking of them in their times in like manner, and making the same complaints, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>. And very grieving and distressing it is to good men to have their abode among wicked men; as well as it is infectious and dangerous: to hear their profane and blasphemous talk, to see their wicked and filthy actions, and to observe their abominable conversation, is very vexatious, and gives great uneasiness, as it did to righteous Lot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a>.

May God answer this his supplication as He has heard his praise, and interest Himself on behalf of His servant, the sheep that is exposed to great danger. The petitions "give me understanding" and "deliver me" go hand-in-hand, because the poet is one who is persecuted for the sake of his faith, and is just as much in need of the fortifying of his faith as of deliverance from the outward restraint that is put upon him. &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a shrill audible prayer; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, a fervent and urgent prayer. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, prop. to answer, signifies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-172.htm">Psalm 119:172</a> to begin, strike up, attune (as does &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; also sometimes). According to the rule in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a> the poet bases his petition for help upon the purpose of thankful praise of God and of His word. Knowing how to value rightly what he possesses, he is warranted in further supplicating and hoping for the good that he does not as yet possess. The "salvation" for which he longs (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-40.htm">Psalm 119:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-20.htm">Psalm 119:20</a>) is redemption from the evil world, in which the life of his own soul is imperilled. May then God's judgments (defective plural, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-149.htm">Psalm 119:149</a>, which the Syriac only takes a singular) succour him (&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;). God's hand, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-173.htm">Psalm 119:173</a>, and God's word afford him succour; the two are involved in one another, the word is the medium of His hand. After this relationship of the poet to God's word, which is attested a hundredfold in the Psalm, it may seem strange that he can say of himself &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;; and perhaps the accentuation is correct when it does not allow itself to be determined by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, but interprets: If I have gone astray - seek Thou like a lost sheep Thy servant. &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; is a sheep that is lost (cf. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as an appellation of the dispersion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>) and in imminent danger of total destruction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-38.htm">Leviticus 26:38</a>). In connection with that interpretation which is followed by the interpunction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a> is also more easily connected with what precedes: his going astray is no apostasy; his home, to which he longs to return when he has been betrayed into by-ways, is beside the Lord. </body></html>
