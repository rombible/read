See here the character of a good man; he is for living peaceably with all men. And let us follow David as he prefigured Christ; in our distress let us cry unto the Lord, and he will hear us. Let us follow after peace and holiness, striving to overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/120.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace - This trouble is no new thing. It has been long continued, and has become intolerable. Who this was that thus gave him trouble is, of course, now unknown. It is only necessary to remark that there can scarcely be any source of trouble more bitter than that of sustaining such relations to others either in business, or in office, or by family-ties - whether by marriage or by blood - in school, in college, or in corporate bodies - as to expose us always to a quarrel: to be compelled to have constant contact with people of sour, perverse, crooked tempers, who are satisfied with nothing; who are suspicious or envious; who pervert our motives and our conduct; who misrepresent our words; who demand more than is due to them; who refuse to perform what may reasonably be expected of them; and who make use of every opportunity to involve us in difficulties with others. There are many trials in human life, but there are few which are more galling, or more hard to bear than this. The literal rendering of the passage would be, "Long for her has my soul dwelt," etc. That is, long (or too long) for her good - for the welfare of my soul. It has been an injury to me; to my piety, to my comfort, to my salvation. it has vexed me, tried me, hindered me in my progress in the divine life. Nothing would have a greater tendency of this kind than to be compelled to live in the manner indicated above. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/120.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. While those who surrounded him were maliciously hostile, he was disposed to peace. This Psalm may well begin such a series as this, as a contrast to the promised joys of God's worship.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/120.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/120.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. The God of peace, against whom their carnal minds are enmity itself; Christ, the Prince of peace, the Man, the Peace, who has made peace by the blood of his cross, whom the world hates; the sons of peace, the quiet in the land, against whom the wicked devise evil things; the Gospel of peace, which the natural man abhors as foolishness; the way of peace, pardon, and salvation by Christ, which carnal men know not, and do not approve of; and the ordinances of the Gospel, which are paths of peace. In short, some are of such restless, quarrelsome, and contentious spirits, that they hate peace with any; are like the troubled sea, that cannot rest; and cannot sleep, unless they do mischief to their fellow creatures: it is very uncomfortable living, especially living long with such. The Targum is, <p>"my soul hath long dwelt with Edom, hating peace;'' <p>that is, with the Romans or Christians, who are intended; for the Jews understand this psalm of their present captivity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/120.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/120.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

May God answer this his supplication as He has heard his praise, and interest Himself on behalf of His servant, the sheep that is exposed to great danger. The petitions "give me understanding" and "deliver me" go hand-in-hand, because the poet is one who is persecuted for the sake of his faith, and is just as much in need of the fortifying of his faith as of deliverance from the outward restraint that is put upon him. &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a shrill audible prayer; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, a fervent and urgent prayer. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, prop. to answer, signifies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-172.htm">Psalm 119:172</a> to begin, strike up, attune (as does &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; also sometimes). According to the rule in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a> the poet bases his petition for help upon the purpose of thankful praise of God and of His word. Knowing how to value rightly what he possesses, he is warranted in further supplicating and hoping for the good that he does not as yet possess. The "salvation" for which he longs (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-40.htm">Psalm 119:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-20.htm">Psalm 119:20</a>) is redemption from the evil world, in which the life of his own soul is imperilled. May then God's judgments (defective plural, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-149.htm">Psalm 119:149</a>, which the Syriac only takes a singular) succour him (&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;, not &#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;). God's hand, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-173.htm">Psalm 119:173</a>, and God's word afford him succour; the two are involved in one another, the word is the medium of His hand. After this relationship of the poet to God's word, which is attested a hundredfold in the Psalm, it may seem strange that he can say of himself &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;; and perhaps the accentuation is correct when it does not allow itself to be determined by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, but interprets: If I have gone astray - seek Thou like a lost sheep Thy servant. &#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; is a sheep that is lost (cf. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as an appellation of the dispersion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>) and in imminent danger of total destruction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-38.htm">Leviticus 26:38</a>). In connection with that interpretation which is followed by the interpunction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a> is also more easily connected with what precedes: his going astray is no apostasy; his home, to which he longs to return when he has been betrayed into by-ways, is beside the Lord. </body></html>
