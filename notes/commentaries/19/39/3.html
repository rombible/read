Like the modern poet, the Hebrew bard had felt<p>“Twere better not to breathe or speak<p>Than cry for strength, remaining weak,<p>And seem to find, but still to seek.”<p>“But thought is too much for him, and he breaks into speech, not, however, fretfully, still less with bitter invective against others.

Watchfulness in the habit, is the bridle upon the head; watchfulness in acts, is the hand upon the bridle. When not able to separate from wicked men, we should remember they will watch our words, and turn them, if they can, to our disadvantage. Sometimes it may be necessary to keep silence, even from good words; but in general we are wrong when backward to engage in edifying discourse. Impatience is a sin that has its cause within ourselves, and that is, musing; and its ill effects upon ourselves, and that is no less than burning. In our greatest health and prosperity, every man is altogether vanity, he cannot live long; he may die soon. This is an undoubted truth, but we are very unwilling to believe it. Therefore let us pray that God would enlighten our minds by his Holy Spirit, and fill our hearts with his grace, that we may be ready for death every day and hour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My heart was hot within me - My mind became more and more excited; my feelings more and more intense.

The friction of inward thoughts produced an intense mental heat. The door of his heart was shut, and with the fire of sorrow burning within, the chamber of his soul soon grew unbearable with heat. Silence is an awful thing for a sufferer, it is the surest method to produce madness. Mourner, tell your sorrow; do it first and most fully to God, but even to pour it out before some wise and godly friend is far from being wasted breath. "While I was musing the fire burned." As he thought upon the ease of the wicked and his own daily affliction, he could not unravel the mystery of providence, and therefore he became greatly agitated. While his heart was musing it was fusing, for the subject was confusing. It became harder every moment to be quiet; his volcanic soul was tossed with an inward ocean of fire, and heaved to and fro with a mental earthquake; an eruption was imminent, the burning lava must pour forth in a fiery stream. "Then spake I with my tongue." The original is grandly laconic. "I spake." The muzzled tongue burst all its bonds. The gag was hurled away. Misery, like murder, will out. You can silence praise, but anguish is clamorous. Resolve or no resolve, heed or no heed, sin or no sin, the impetuous torrent forced for itself a channel and swept away every restraint.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-4.htm">Psalm 39:4</a><p>"Lord." It is well that the vent of his soul was Godward and not towards man. Oh! if my swelling heart must speak, Lord let it speak with thee; even if there be too much of natural heat in what I say, thou wilt be more patient with me than man, and upon thy purity it can cast not stain; whereas if I speak to my fellows, they may harshly rebuke me or else learn evil from my petulance. "Make me to know my end." Did he mean the same as Elias in his agony, "Let me die, I am no better than my fathers?" Perhaps so. At any rate, he rashly and petulantly desired to know the end of his wretched life, that he might begin to reckon the days till death should put a finis to his woe. Impatience would pry between the folded leaves. As if there were no other comfort to be had, unbelief would fain hide itself in the grave and sleep itself into oblivion. David was neither the first nor the last who had spoken unadvisedly in prayer. Yet, there is a better meaning: the Psalmist would know more of the shortness of life, that he might better bear its transient ills, and herein we may safely kneel with him, uttering the same petition. That there is no end to its misery is the hell of hell; that there is an end to life's sorrow is the hope of all who have a hope beyond the grave. God is the best teacher of the divine philosophy which looks for an expected end. They who see death through the Lord's glass, see a fair sight, which makes them forget the evil of life in foreseeing the end of life. "And the measure of my days." David would fain be assured that his days would be soon over and his trials with them; he would be taught anew that life is measured out to us by wisdom, and is not a matter of chance. As the trader measures his cloth by inches, and ells, and yards, so with scrupulous accuracy is life measured out to man. "That I may know how frail I am," or when I shall cease to be. Alas! poor human nature, dear as life is, man quarrels with God at such a rate that he would sooner cease to be than bear the Lord's appointment. Such pettishness in a saint! Let us wait till we are in a like position, and we shall do no better. The ship on the stocks wonders that the barque springs a leak, but when it has tried the high seas, it marvels that its timbers hold together in such storms. David's case is not recorded for our imitation, but for our learning.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a><p>"Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth." Upon consideration, the Psalmist finds little room to bewail the length of life, but rather to bemoan its shortness. What changeful creatures we are! One moment we cry to be rid of existence, and the next instant beg to have it prolonged! A handbreadth is one of the shortest natural measures, being the breadth of four fingers; such is the brevity of life, by divine appointment; God has made it so, fixing the period in wisdom. The "behold" calls us to attention; to some the thought of life's hastiness will bring the acutest pain, to others the most solemn earnestness. How well should those live who are to live so little! Is my earthly pilgrimage so brief? then let me watch every step of it, that in the little of time there may be much of grace. "And mine age is as nothing before thee." So short as not to amount to an entity. Think of eternity, and an angel is as a new-born babe, the world a fresh blown bubble, the sun a spark just fallen from the fire, and man a nullity. Before the Eternal, all the age of frail man is less than one ticking of a clock. "Verily, every man at his best state is altogether vanity." This is the surest truth, that nothing about man is either sure or true. Take man at his best, he is but a man, and man is a mere breath, unsubstantial as the wind. Man is settled, as the margin has it, and by divine decree it is settled that he shall not be settled. He is constant only in inconstancy. His vanity is his only verity; his best, of which he is vain, is but vain; and this is verily true of every man, that everything about him is every way fleeting. This is sad news for those whose treasures are beneath the moon; those whose glorying is in themselves may well hang the flag half-mast; but those whose best estate is settled upon them in Christ Jesus in the land of unfading flowers, may rejoice that it is no vain thing in which they trust.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a><p>"Surely every man walketh in a vain shew." Life is but a passing pageant. This alone is sure, that nothing is sure. All around us shadows mock us; we walk among them, and too many live for them as if the mocking images were substantial; acting their borrowed parts with zeal fit only to be spent on realities, and lost upon the phantoms of this passing scene. Worldly men walk like travellers in a mirage, deluded, duped, deceived, soon to be filled with disappointment and despair. "Surely they are disquieted in vain." Men fret, and fume, and worry, and all for mere nothing. They are shadows pursuing shadows, while death pursues them. He who toils and contrives, and wearies himself for gold, for fame, for rank, even if he wins his desire, finds at the end his labour lost; for like the treasure of the miser's dream, it all vanishes when the man awakes in the world of reality. Read change, the din of the city streets, and remember that all this noise (for so the word means), this breach of quiet, is made about unsubstantial, fleeting vanities. Broken rest, anxious fear, over-worked brain, failing mind, lunacy, these are steps in the process of disquieting with many, and all to be rich, or, in other words, to load one's self with the thick clay; clay, too, which a man must leave so soon. "He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them." He misses often the result of his ventures, for there are many slips between the cup and the lips. His wheat is sheaved, but an interloping robber bears it away - as often happens with the poor Eastern husbandman; or, the wheat is even stored, but the invader feasts thereon. Many work for others all unknown to them. Especially does this verse refer to those all-gathering muckrakes, who in due time are succeeded by all-scattering forks, which scatter riches as profusely as their sires gathered them parsimoniously. We know not our heirs, for our children die, and strangers fill the old ancestral halls; estates change hands, and entail, though riveted with a thousand bonds, yields to the corroding power of time. Men rise up early and sit up late to build a house, and then the stranger tramps along its passages, laughs in its chambers, and forgetful of its first builder, calls it all his own. Here is one of the evils under the sun for which no remedy can be prescribed. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/39.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Musing, </span> i.e. considering in my own thoughts the great wickedness and successfulness of mine enemies, and other wicked men; and withal mine own and other good mews integrity, attended with great troubles and miseries in this life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The fire burned; </span> my thoughts kindled my passions. <span class="ital">Then spake I with my tongue</span>, to wit, such words as I had purposed not to speak, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm" title="I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.">Psalm 39:1</a></span>; rash and impatient words: either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This construction is indispensable where it is intended to give special prominence to the subject notion or a secondary notion of the clause, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a>. In one instance &#1508;&#1503; is even followed (3) by the perf. and fut. consec., viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>.)<p>but, since in this case one would look for a Waw relat. and a different order of the words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a> is to be regarded as a subject clause: "who, when my foot totters, i.e., when my affliction changes to entire downfall, would magnify themselves against me." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>,   &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; connects what follows with &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1496; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; by way of confirmation: he is &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; &#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;, ready for falling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>), he will, if God does not graciously interpose, assuredly fall headlong. The fourth &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-19.htm">Psalm 38:19</a> is attached confirmatorily to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>: his intense pain or sorrow is ever present to him, for he is obliged to confess his guilt, and this feeling of guilt is just the very sting of his pain. And whilst he in the consciousness of well-deserved punishment is sick unto death, his foes are numerous and withal vigorous and full of life. Instead of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, probably &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-5.htm">Psalm 69:5</a>, is to be read (Houbigant, Hitzig, Kster, Hupfeld, Ewald, and Olshausen). But even the lxx read &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;; and the reading which is so old, although it does not very well suit &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (instead of which one would look for &#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;), is still not without meaning: he looks upon himself, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-9.htm">Psalm 38:9</a>, more as one dead than living; his foes, however, are &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, living, i.e., vigorous. The verb frequently ash this pregnant meaning, and the adjective can also have it. Just as the accentuation of the form &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; varies elsewhere out of pause, &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; here has the tone on the ultima, although it is not perf. consec.<p>(Note: As perf. consec. the following have the accent on the ultima: - &#1493;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>, and &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; perhaps also &#1493;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, and &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (perf. hypoth.), <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-15.htm">Job 32:15</a>.
