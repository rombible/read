If the world be nothing but vanity, may God deliver us from having or seeking our portion in it. When creature-confidences fail, it is our comfort that we have a God to go to, a God to trust in. We may see a good God doing all, and ordering all events concerning us; and a good man, for that reason, says nothing against it. He desires the pardoning of his sin, and the preventing of his shame. We must both watch and pray against sin. When under the correcting hand of the Lord, we must look to God himself for relief, not to any other. Our ways and our doings bring us into trouble, and we are beaten with a rod of our own making. What a poor thing is beauty! and what fools are those that are proud of it, when it will certainly, and may quickly, be consumed! The body of man is as a garment to the soul. In this garment sin has lodged a moth, which wears away, first the beauty, then the strength, and finally the substance of its parts. Whoever has watched the progress of a lingering distemper, or the work of time alone, in the human frame, will feel at once the force of this comparison, and that, surely every man is vanity. Afflictions are sent to stir up prayer. If they have that effect, we may hope that God will hear our prayer. The believer expects weariness and ill treatment on his way to heaven; but he shall not stay here long : walking with God by faith, he goes forward on his journey, not diverted from his course, nor cast down by the difficulties he meets. How blessed it is to sit loose from things here below, that while going home to our Father's house, we may use the world as not abusing it! May we always look for that city, whose Builder and Maker is God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remove thy stroke away from me - And yet this calm submission, as expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>, does not take away the desire that the hand of God may be removed, and that the suffering that is brought upon us may cease. Perfect submission is not inconsistent with the prayer that, if it be the will of God, the calamity may be removed: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>.

It is equivalent here to chastisement, or judgment. It refers to the trial which he was then enduring, whatever it was, which had given occasion to the feelings that he says <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1-2</a> he had felt bound to suppress when in the presence of the wicked, but in reference to which he had learned entirely to acquiesce <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">Psalm 39:9</a>. From that trial itself he now prays that he may be delivered.<p>I am consumed - I am wasting away. I cannot long bear up under it. I must sink down to the grave if it is not removed.

That is, the blow which God brings on anyone when he has, as it were, a "strife" or a "conflict" with him.

The psalmist still considers his affliction as coming from the hand of God, as his stroke upon him, and which lay as a heavy burden on him, and which God only could remove; and to him he applies for the removal of it, who is to be sought unto by his people to do such things for them; nor is such an application any ways contrary to that silence and patience before expressed; <p>I am consumed by the blow of thine hand; meaning either that his flesh was consumed by his affliction, which came from the hand of God, or he should be consumed if he did not remove it: he could not bear up under it, but must sink and die; if he continued to strive and contend with him, his spirit would fail before him, and the soul that he had made; and therefore he entreats he would remember he was but dust, and remove his hand from him; for this is a reason enforcing the preceding petition. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/39.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/39.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">stroke</span>] The same word as that rendered <span class="ital">plague</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm" title="My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.">Psalm 38:11</a>.

Oh that God would then grant him to know his end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>), i.e., the end of his life, which is at the same time the end of his affliction, and the measure of his days, how it is with this (&#1502;&#1492;, interrog. extenuantis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>), in order that he may become fully conscious of his own frailty! Hupfeld corrects the text to &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491;, after the analogy of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-48.htm">Psalm 89:48</a>, because &#1495;&#1491;&#1500; cannot signify "frail." But &#1495;&#1491;&#1500; signifies that which leaves off and ceases, and consequently in this connection, finite and transitory or frail. &#1502;&#1492;, quam, in connection with an adjective, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-3.htm">Psalm 66:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>.

God has, indeed, made the days, i.e., the lifetime, of a man &#1496;&#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, handbreadths, i.e., He has allotted to it only the short extension of a few handbreadths (cf. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, a few days, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>), of which nine make a yard (cf. &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; in Mimnermus, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>); the duration of human life (on &#1495;&#1500;&#1491; vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>) is as a vanishing nothing before God the eternal One. The particle &#1488;&#1498; is originally affirmative, and starting from that sense becomes restrictive; just as &#1512;&#1511; is originally restrictive and then affirmative. Sometimes also, as is commonly the case with &#1488;&#1499;&#1503;, the affirmative signification passes over into the adversative (cf. verum, verum enim vero). In our passage, agreeably to the restrictive sense, it is to be explained thus: nothing but mere nothingness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-14.htm">Psalm 45:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2</a>) is every man &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, standing firmly, i.e., though he stand never so firmly, though he be never so stedfast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-16.htm">Zechariah 11:16</a>). Here the music rises to tones of bitter lament, and the song continues in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a> with the same theme. &#1510;&#1500;&#1501;, belonging to the same root as &#1510;&#1500;, signifies a shadow-outline, an image; the &#1489;&#1468; is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>, Beth essentiae: he walks about consisting only of an unsubstantial shadow. Only &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, breath-like, or after the manner of breath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>), from empty, vain motives and with vain results, do they make a disturbance (pausal fut. energicum, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>); and he who restlessly and noisily exerts himself knows not who will suddenly snatch together, i.e., take altogether greedily to himself, the many things that he heaps up (&#1510;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16</a>); cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a>, and on  - a&#772;m  equals  &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-10.htm">Leviticus 15:10</a> (in connection with which &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-16.htm">Isaiah 42:16</a>, is in the mind of the speaker). </body></html>
