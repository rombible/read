Watchfulness in the habit, is the bridle upon the head; watchfulness in acts, is the hand upon the bridle. When not able to separate from wicked men, we should remember they will watch our words, and turn them, if they can, to our disadvantage. Sometimes it may be necessary to keep silence, even from good words; but in general we are wrong when backward to engage in edifying discourse. Impatience is a sin that has its cause within ourselves, and that is, musing; and its ill effects upon ourselves, and that is no less than burning. In our greatest health and prosperity, every man is altogether vanity, he cannot live long; he may die soon. This is an undoubted truth, but we are very unwilling to believe it. Therefore let us pray that God would enlighten our minds by his Holy Spirit, and fill our hearts with his grace, that we may be ready for death every day and hour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/39.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth - literally, "Lo, handbreadths hast thou given my days." The word rendered "handbreadth" means properly the spread hand; the palm; the hand when the four fingers are expanded. The word is then used to denote anything very short or brief. It is one of the smallest natural measures, as distinguished from the "foot" - that is, the length of the foot; and from the cubit - that is, the length of the arm to the elbow. It is the "shortness" of life, therefore, that is the subject of painful and complaining reflection here. Who has not been in a state of mind to sympathize with the feelings of the psalmist? Who is there that does not often wonder, when he thinks of what he could and would accomplish on earth if his life extended to one thousand years, and when he thinks of the great interests at stake in reference to another world which God has made dependent on so short a life? Who can at all times so calm down his feelings as to give utterance to no expressions of impatience that life is so soon to terminate? Who is there that reflects on the great interests at stake that has not asked the question why God has not given man more time to prepare for eternity?<p>And mine age - Or, my life. The word used here - &#1495;&#1500;&#1491;  cheled - means properly "duration of life," lifetime; and then, life itself; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a>.<p>Is as nothing - That is, it is so short that it seems to be nothing at all.<p>Before thee - As over against thee; that is, in comparison with thee. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>, "All nations "before him" are as nothing;" that is, over against him, or in comparison with him. When the two are placed together, the one seems to be as nothing in the presence of the other. So the life of man, when placed by the side of the life of God, seems to be absolutely nothing.<p>Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity - Margin, "settled." The idea is, that every man is "constituted" vanity. Literally, "All vanity every man is constituted." There seems to be nothing but vanity; and this is the result of a divine constitution or arrangement. The idea expressed in our common version, "at his best state," however true in itself, is not in the original. The thoughts in the original are:<p>(a) that all people are vanity; that is, life is so short, and man accomplishes so little, that it seems to be perfect vanity; and<p>(b) that this is the result of the divine constitution under which man was made.<p>It was the fact that man has been "so made" which gave so much trouble to the mind of the psalmist. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/39.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

These words, with the following clause, are the psalmist's answer to his own inquiries; or rather a correction of his inquiry and impatience, showing how needless it was to ask such questions, and be impatient to die, when it was so clear and certain a case that life was so short; not a yard or ell (forty five inches), but an handbreadth, the breadth of four fingers; or at most a span of time was allowed to man, whose days are few, like the shadow that declineth, and the grass that withers; by which figurative expressions the brevity of human life is described, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>; and this is the measure made, cut out, and appointed by the Lord himself, who has determined the years, months, and days of man's life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>; <p>and mine age is as nothing before thee; in the sight of God, or in comparison of his eternity; not so much as an handbreadth, or to be accounted as an inch, but nothing at, all; yea, less than nothing, and vanity; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>; that is, the age or life of man in this world, as the word (w) used signifies; for otherwise the age or life of man, in the world to come, is of an everlasting duration; but the years of this present life are threescore and ten; ordinarily speaking; an hundred and thirty are by Jacob reckoned but few; and even a thousand years with the Lord are but as one day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>; <p>verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. As vanity may signify sin, emptiness, folly, falsehood, fickleness, and inconstancy; for man is a very sinful creature, empty of all that is good; foolish as to the knowledge of divine things; he is deceiving and deceived, his heart is deceitful and desperately wicked; and he is unstable in all his ways: he is "all vanity" (x), as the words may be rendered; all that he has, or is, or is in him, is vanity; his body, in the health, beauty, and strength of it, is subject to change; and so are his mind, his memory, his judgment and affections, his purposes and promises; and so are his goods and estate, his riches and honours; yea, all the vanity that is in the creatures, that is, in the vegetable and sensitive creatures, yea, that is in the whole, world, is in him; who is a microcosm, a little world himself: and this is true of every man, even in his "best settled" (y) estate; when he stood the most firm, as the word used signifies; it is true of men of high and low degree, of the wise, knowing, and learned, as well as of the illiterate and ignorant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>; even of those that are in the most prosperous circumstances, in the greatest ease and affluence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16</a>; David himself had an experience of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>; yea, this is true of Adam in his best estate, in his estate of innocence; for he was even then subject to change, as the event has shown; and being in honour, he abode not long; and, though upright, became sinful, and came short of the glory of God: indeed, the spiritual estate of believers in Christ is so well settled as that it cannot be altered; nor is it subject to any vanity. <p>Selah.

In one instance &#1508;&#1503; is even followed (3) by the perf. and fut. consec., viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>.)<p>but, since in this case one would look for a Waw relat. and a different order of the words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a> is to be regarded as a subject clause: "who, when my foot totters, i.e., when my affliction changes to entire downfall, would magnify themselves against me." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>,   &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; connects what follows with &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1496; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; by way of confirmation: he is &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; &#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;, ready for falling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>), he will, if God does not graciously interpose, assuredly fall headlong. The fourth &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-19.htm">Psalm 38:19</a> is attached confirmatorily to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>: his intense pain or sorrow is ever present to him, for he is obliged to confess his guilt, and this feeling of guilt is just the very sting of his pain.

Instead of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, probably &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-5.htm">Psalm 69:5</a>, is to be read (Houbigant, Hitzig, Kster, Hupfeld, Ewald, and Olshausen).

Instead of &#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497; (Ges. 61, rem. 2) the Ker is &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1497;, ra&#772;dephi&#770;  (without any Makkeph following), or &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1497;, ra&#772;dophi&#770;; cf. on this pronunciation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a>, and with the Chethb &#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;, the Chethb &#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1508;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a>, also &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>. By the "following of that which is good" David means more particularly that which is brought into exercise in relation to his present foes.<p>(Note: In the Greek and Latin texts, likewise in all the Aethiopic and several Arabic texts, and in the Syriac Psalterium Medilanense, the following addition is found after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-21.htm">Psalm 38:21</a> : Ce aperripsan me ton agapeton osi necron ebdelygmenon, Et projecerunt me dilectum tanquam mortuum abominatum (so the Psalt. Veronense). Theodoret refers it to Absalom's relation to David. The words &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>.)<p>He closes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a> with sighs for help. No lighting up of the darkness of wrath takes place. The fides supplex is not changed into fides triumphans. But the closing words, "O Lord, my salvation" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>), show where the repentance of Cain and that of David differ. True repentance has faith within itself, it despairs of itself, but not of God. </body></html>
