The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. The upright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speak peaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a false tongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and one another in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatest degree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief of God's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness.

That is, they take counsel; they encourage each other; they urge one another forward; they suggest to each other methods by which what they purpose may be done, and by which difficulties may be overcome. This was a part of their "secret counsel" or their consultation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-2.htm">Psalm 64:2</a>.<p>In an evil matter - Margin, as in Hebrew, speech. The reference is to their purpose or plan. They strengthen themselves for doing what they know to be a wrong or wicked thing.<p>They commune - literally, they tell or speak. That is, they tell each other how it may be done, or suggest different methods by which it may be successfully accomplishled. They compare views, that they may select that which will be most likely to be successful. All this indicates plan, consultation, design.<p>Of laying snares privily - Margin, as in Hebrew, to hide snares. This is a figure derived from the method of taking wild beasts.

The reference here is to some secret plan by which they intended that the author of the psalm should be entrapped and ruined.

Who will be aware of their existence? They sought to make the plan so secret that no one could discover it, or even suspect it; to keep it so concealed that he for whom it was intended could not be put on his guard.

By &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; he contrasts with his own person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm">Psalm 59:16</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>., the party of the enemy, before which he has retreated into the desert. It is open to question whether &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; is intended to be referred, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>, to the persecuted one (to destroy my life), or, with Hupfeld, to the persecutors (to their own destruction, they themselves for destruction). If the former reference to the persecuted be adopted, we ought, in order to give prominence to the evidently designed antithesis to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-9.htm">Psalm 63:9</a>, to translate: those, however, who..., shall go down into the depths of the earth (Bttcher, and others); a rendering which is hazardous as regards the syntax, after &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; and in connection with this position of the words. Therefore translate: On the other hand, those, to (their own) ruin do they seek my soul. It is true this ought properly to be expressed by &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;, but the absence of the suffix is less hazardous than the above relative rendering of &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;. What follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10-11</a> is the expansion of &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;. The futures from &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; onwards are to be taken as predictive, not as imprecatory; the former accords better with the quiet, gentle character of the whole song. It shall be with them as with the company of Korah. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is the interior of the earth down into its deepest bottom; this signification also holds good in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>.<p>(Note: In this passage in Isaiah are meant the depths of the earth (lxx &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;), the earth down to its inmost part, with its caverns, abysses, and subterranean passages.

The enallage is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>., and frequently: the singular refers to each individual of the homogeneous multitude, or to this multitude itself as a concrete persona moralis. The king, however, who is now banished from Jerusalem to the habitation of jackals, will, whilst they become a portion (&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;  equals  &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;), i.e., prey, of the jackals (vid., the fulfilment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7</a>.), rejoice in Elohim. Every one who sweareth by Him shall boast himself. Theodoret understands this of swearing &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. Hengstenberg compares the oath &#1495;&#1497; &#1508;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-15.htm">Genesis 42:15</a>. Ewald also (217, f) assumes this explanation to be unquestionable. But the Israelite is to swear by the name of Jahve and by no other, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>. If the king were meant, why was it not rather expressed by &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1500;&#1493;, he who swears allegiance to him? The syntax does not help us to decide to what the &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; refers. Neinrich Moeller (1573) says of the &#1489;&#1493; as referred to the king: peregrinum est et coactum; and A. H. Franke in his Introductio in Psalterium says of it as referred to Elohim: coactum est. So far as the language is concerned, both references are admissible; but as regards the subject-matter, only the latter. The meaning, as everywhere else, is a searing by God. He who, without allowing himself to turn from it, swore by Elohim, the God of Israel, the God of David His anointed, and therefore acknowledged Him as the Being exalted above all things, shall boast himself or "glory," inasmuch as it shall be practically seen how well-founded and wise was this recognition. He shall glory, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped, forcibly closed, viz., those who, together with confidence in the Christ of God, have by falsehood also undermined the reverence which is due to God Himself. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/64-1.htm">Psalm 64:1-10</a> closes very similarly, and hence is placed next in order. </body></html>
