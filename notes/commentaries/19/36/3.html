It is an awful picture of wickedness of a man abandoning himself without check or remorse to the inspiration of his own evil heart. He goes from bad to worse. In a great English tragedy, the murderer, though he has determined to wade farther in blood, yet prays against the horror of nightly temptations:<p>“Merciful powers,<p>Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature<p>Gives way to in repose.<p>But this man “deviseth mischief upon his bed.” When even the worst criminals shudder at their own deeds, whispering to their “deaf pillows” the agonies that creep over them with darkness and silence, this ungodly man of the Hebrew poet’s picture is occupied rather in scheming fresh villainies; even then <span class= "ital">he abhorreth not evil, </span>or better, <span class= "ital">rejecteth not, </span>catches rather at every fresh suggestion, and shapes it to his end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/36.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/36-3.htm" title="The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he has left off to be wise, and to do good....">Psalm 36:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit — </span>Are wicked and deceitful. <span class="ital">He hath left off to be wise and to do good — </span>Once he had some degrees of wisdom, and did things that were apparently good, and seemed to be under the government of religion: but now he is an open apostate from that which he once professed. <span class="ital">He deviseth mischief upon his bed — </span>Freely from his own inclination, when none are present to provoke him to it. <span class="ital">He setteth himself in a way that is not good — </span>He doth not repent of his wicked devices, but resolutely proceeds to execute them, and persists therein. <span class="ital">He abhorreth not evil — </span>Though he sometimes professes to feel remorse for his conduct, and desists for a time from his evil practices, yet he does not truly repent of, nor abhor them, and therefore is ready to return to them when any occasion offers itself.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:1-4 From this psalm our hearts should be duly affected with hatred of sin, and seek satisfaction in God's loving-kindness. Here is the root of bitterness, from which all the wickedness of wicked men comes. It takes rise from contempt of God, and the want of due regard to him. Also from the deceit they put upon their own souls. Let us daily beg of God to preserve us from self-flattery. Sin is very hurtful to the sinner himself, and therefore ought to be hateful; but it is not so. It is no marvel, if those that deceive themselves, seek to deceive all mankind; to whom will they be true, who are false to their own souls? It is bad to do mischief, but worse to devise it, to do it with plot and management. If we willingly banish holy meditations in our solitary hours, Satan will soon occupy our minds with sinful imaginations. Hardened sinners stand to what they have done, as though they could justify it before God himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit - Are false and wicked. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>. It is words do not fairly represent or express what is in his heart.<p>He hath left off to be wise - To act wisely; to do right.<p>And to do good - To act benevolently and kindly. This would seem to imply that there had been a change in his conduct, or that he was not what he once professed to be, and appeared to be. This language would be applicable to the change in the conduct of Saul toward David after he became envious and jealous of him <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18.htm">1 Samuel 18</a>; and it is possible, as Amyraldus supposed, that this may have had particular reference to him. But such instances of a change, of feeling and conduct are not very uncommon in the world, and it may doubtless have happened that David experienced this more than once in his life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4. This reflection detailed.<p>until his iniquity&#8212;literally, "for finding his iniquity for hating"; that is, he persuades himself God will not so find it&#8212;"for hating" involving the idea of punishing. Hence his words of iniquity and deceit, and his bold rejection of all right principles of conduct. The climax is that he deliberately adopts and patronizes evil.

Not only sinful, but sin itself; his mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, of filthy and unchaste words, of corrupt communication, lying, deceit, and flattery; out of the abundance of the wickedness of his heart his mouth speaketh; and which shows the badness of it, and proves all that is said before of him; <p>he hath left off to be wise, and to do good; by which the psalmist seems to intend one that had been a professor of religion, who, besides the light of nature he had acted contrary to, had had the advantage of a divine revelation, and had been enlightened into the knowledge of divine things, and had done many things externally good, particularly acts of beneficence; but now had dropped his profession of religion, denied the truths he had been enlightened into, and ceased from doing good; otherwise a natural man understandeth not; and, though he is wise to do evil, to do good he has no knowledge. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The words of his mouth <i>are</i> iniquity and <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> deceit: he hath left off to be wise, <i>and</i> to do good.</span><p>(c) The reprobates mock wholesome doctrine, and put no difference between good and evil.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/36.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">iniquity and deceit</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/5-5.htm" title="The foolish shall not stand in your sight: you hate all workers of iniquity....">Psalm 5:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-7.htm" title="His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.">Psalm 10:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he hath left off</span> &c.] Or, <span class="ital">he hath ceased to be wise to do good</span>.
