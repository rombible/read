Here is the root of bitterness, from which all the wickedness of wicked men comes. It takes rise from contempt of God, and the want of due regard to him. Also from the deceit they put upon their own souls. Let us daily beg of God to preserve us from self-flattery. Sin is very hurtful to the sinner himself, and therefore ought to be hateful; but it is not so. It is no marvel, if those that deceive themselves, seek to deceive all mankind; to whom will they be true, who are false to their own souls? It is bad to do mischief, but worse to devise it, to do it with plot and management. If we willingly banish holy meditations in our solitary hours, Satan will soon occupy our minds with sinful imaginations. Hardened sinners stand to what they have done, as though they could justify it before God himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He deviseth mischief upon his bed - Margin, as in Hebrew: "vanity." That is, when he lies down; when he is wakeful at night; he plots some scheme of iniquity - some vain, wicked enterprise. So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>, "For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall."<p>He setteth himself - That is, he takes his stand or his position; he assumes this attitude. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, "The kings of the earth "set themselves,"" where the same word occurs. The meaning is that what is done by him is the result of a calm and deliberate purpose. It is not the effect of passion or temporary excitement, but it is a deliberate act in which the mind is made up to do the thing. The conduct here referred to is thus distinguished from rash and hasty acts, showing that this is the settled character of the man.<p>In a way that is not good - In a bad or wicked way; in a way in which no good can be found; in conduct which allows of no redeeming or mitigating circumstances, and for which there can be no apology.<p>He abhorreth not evil - He has no aversion to evil. He is not in any manner deterred from doing anything because it is wrong. The fact that it is sinful is not allowed to be a consideration affecting his mind in determining what he shall do. In other words, the moral quality of an action does not influence him at all in making up his mind as to how he shall act. If it is right, it is by accident, and not because he prefers the right; if it is wrong, that fact does not in any way hinder him from carrying his purpose into execution. This is, of course, the very essence of depravity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4. This reflection detailed.<p>until his iniquity&#8212;literally, "for finding his iniquity for hating"; that is, he persuades himself God will not so find it&#8212;"for hating" involving the idea of punishing. Hence his words of iniquity and deceit, and his bold rejection of all right principles of conduct. The climax is that he deliberately adopts and patronizes evil. The negative forms affirm more emphatically their contraries.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He deviseth mischief upon his bed; </span> which notes that he doth it, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
