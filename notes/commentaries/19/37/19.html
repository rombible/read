Let us not discompose ourselves at what we see in this world. A fretful, discontented spirit is open to many temptations. For, in all respects, the little which is allotted to the righteous, is more comfortable and more profitable than the ill-gotten and abused riches of ungodly men. It comes from a hand of special love. God provides plentifully and well, not only for his working servants, but for his waiting servants. They have that which is better than wealth, peace of mind, peace with God, and then peace in God; that peace which the world cannot give, and which the world cannot have. God knows the believer's days. Not one day's work shall go unrewarded. Their time on earth is reckoned by days, which will soon be numbered; but heavenly happiness shall be for ever. This will be a real support to believers in evil times. Those that rest on the Rock of ages, have no reason to envy the wicked the support of their broken reeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall not be ashamed in the evil thee - In times of calamity and trouble. The word "ashamed" here refers to disappointment; as when one goes to a fountain or stream for water and finds it dried up. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/6-20.htm">Job 6:20</a>, note; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2-3</a>. The idea here is, that when thees of trouble and calamity come, in seasons of famine or want, they will find their expectations, arising from confidence in God, fully met. Their wants will be supplied, and they will find him to be their friend.<p>And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied - Their needs shall be supplied. God will provide for them. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>. This is in accordance with the general promises which are made in the Scriptures, that God will provide for the needs of those who trust in Him.
