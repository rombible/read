What a striking picture is in ver. 35,36, of many a prosperous enemy of God! But God remarkably blights the projects of the prosperous wicked, especially persecutors. None are perfect in themselves, but believers are so in Christ Jesus. If all the saint's days continue dark and cloudy, his dying day may prove comfortable, and his sun set bright; or, if it should set under a cloud, yet his future state will be everlasting peace. The salvation of the righteous will be the Lord's doing. He will help them to do their duties, to bear their burdens; help them to bear their troubles well, and get good by them, and, in due time, will deliver them out of their troubles. Let sinners then depart from evil, and do good; repent of and forsake sin, and trust in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ. Let them take his yoke upon them, and learn of him, that they may dwell for evermore in heaven. Let us mark the closing scenes of different characters, and always depend on God's mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have seen - I have had an opportunity, in my long life <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>, of witnessing the accuracy of the statement just made, that a righteous man may live to see a confirmation of the truth that wickedness, however prosperous the wicked man may be, will lead to ultimate ruin - as I have had an opportunity of seeing <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25-26</a> the effect of a course of righteousness on the ultimate prosperity and happiness of its possessor. The same experience, with the same result, is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-3.htm">Job 5:3</a>.<p>In great power - The word used here - &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;  &#8219;a&#770;r&#305;&#770;yts - means properly "terrible; inspiring terror." It is applied to God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11</a>; and to powerful nations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-3.htm">Isaiah 25:3</a>. It is also used in a bad sense, as denoting violent, fierce, lawless, or a tyrant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-11.htm">Isaiah 13:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-13.htm">Job 27:13</a>. Here it may be used in the sense of one who was prosperous and mighty, and as referring to a man who wielded vast power; but there is connected with that also, undoubtedly, the idea that that power was wielded, not for purposes of benevolence, but for injustice, oppression, and wrong. It was a "wicked" man that was thus powerful.<p>And spreading himself - The word used here means properly to be naked; to make naked; to empty; then, to pour oneself out; and then, to spread oneself abroad. It is applied here to a tree that seems to pour itself out, or to spread itself out in every direction - sending its limbs aloft, and its branches far on every side.<p>Like a green bay tree - Margin: "a green tree that groweth in its own soil." The "bay tree" is a species of laurel, but there is no evidence that the original word here refers particularly to this, or specifically to any other tree. The original word &#1488;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495;  'ezra&#770;ch - is derived from &#1494;&#1512;&#1495;  za&#770;rach, to rise; and then, to spring up as a plant does, and it properly means here, as expressed in the margin, "a native tree;" that is, a tree that grows in its own soil, or that has not been transplanted. Then, also, it comes to denote a native; one born in the country, not a foreigner: <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>, et al. The idea here is that a tree which thus remains in its own soil is more vigorous, and will attain to a larger growth, than one which is transplanted; and thus the figure becomes an emblem of a prosperous and mighty man. "Perhaps," also, there is included here, respecting the man, the idea that he has grown up where he is; that he has not been driven from place to place; that he has had uniform prosperity; that on the very soil which gave him birth he has risen to rank, to wealth, to power. His life has been spent in tranquil scenes, where everything seemed to be stable and secure; what his end will be, the psalmist states in the next verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35, 36. of which a picture is given, under the figure of a flourishing tree (compare Margin), which soon withers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In great power, </span> or <span class="ital">formidable</span>; not only himself out of danger, as it seemed, but terrible to others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And spreading himself; </span> and therefore firmly and deeply rooted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like a green bay tree, </span> which is continually green and flourishing, yea, even in the winter season.

Meaning some particular person invested with great power, in great authority among men, one of the spiritual wickednesses in high places; such a man as Haman in Ahasuerus's court; and though the psalmist does not choose to mention his name, he doubtless had him in his mind; as either Saul, or Doeg the Edomite, or Ahithophel, or some such man, who was in an exalted station of life; and it may be when he himself was in low and distressed circumstances: the word used (c) signifies one formidable and terrible, striking terror to all around; of whom others are afraid, as Aben Ezra interprets it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>; <p>and spreading himself like a green bay tree: or like one that grows up out of the earth of itself, and is in its native soil, and very flourishing: and the metaphor denotes an increase of riches and honour, and a seemingly settled state in the enjoyment of such outward felicity; so Jarchi interprets it  "taking root"; as well as such a man's glorying in and boasting of his affluence and fulness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12</a>. Aben Ezra explains it of a wicked man's openly committing iniquity, declaring his sin as Sodom, and glorying in his shame; but rather it denotes a man in great authority and esteem, as a man crowned with laurels, and in a very exalted and triumphant state. <p>(c) "terrificam", Montanus, Vatablus; "terribilem ant formidabilem", Gejerus, Michaelis; "daunting, terrible", Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">35</span>. <span class="ital">I have seen</span>] Comp. the similar appeal to experience in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm" title="I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.">Psalm 37:25</a></span>; and the close parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-3.htm" title="I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.">Job 5:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in great power</span>] Or, in his terribleness, inspiring terror by tyrannical oppression.
