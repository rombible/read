So it was seen of old, therefore let us not marvel at the matter. We are tempted to fret at this, to think them the only happy people, and so we are prone to do like them: but this we are warned against. Outward prosperity is fading. When we look forward, with an eye of faith, we shall see no reason to envy the wicked. Their weeping and wailing will be everlasting. The life of religion is a believing trust in the Lord, and diligent care to serve him according to his will. It is not trusting God, but tempting him, if we do not make conscience of our duty to him. A man's life consists not in abundance, but, Thou shalt have food convenient for thee. This is more than we deserve, and it is enough for one that is going to heaven. To delight in God is as much a privilege as a duty. He has not promised to gratify the appetites of the body, and the humours of the fancy, but the desires of the renewed, sanctified soul. What is the desire of the heart of a good man? It is this, to know, and love, and serve God. Commit thy way unto the Lord; roll thy way upon the Lord, so the margin reads it. Cast thy burden upon the Lord, the burden of thy care. We must roll it off ourselves, not afflict and perplex ourselves with thoughts about future events, but refer them to God. By prayer spread thy case and all thy cares before the Lord, and trust in him. We must do our duty, and then leave the event with God. The promise is very sweet: He shall bring that to pass, whatever it is, which thou has committed to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Commit thy way unto the - Lord. Margin, as in Hebrew, "Roll thy way upon, the Lord." Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>, where the marg., as the Hebrew, is, "He rolled himself on the Lord." See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>. The idea is that of rolling a heavy burden from ourselves on another, or laying it upon him, so that he may bear it. The burden which we have not got strength to bear we may lay on God. The term "way" means properly the act of treading or going; then, a way or path; then, a course of life, or the manner in which one lives; and the reference here is to the whole course of life, or all that can affect life; all our plans or conduct; all the issues or results of those plans. It is equivalent here to "lot" or "destiny." Everything, in regard to the manner in which we live, and all its results, are to be committed to the Lord.<p>Trust also in him - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3</a>.<p>And he shall bring it to pass - Hebrew, "He shall do it." That is, He will bring it to a proper issue; He will secure a happy result. He will take care of your interests, and will not permit you to suffer, or to be ultimately wronged. The thing particularly referred to here, as appears from the next verse, is reputation or character. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Roll the whole burden of life upon the Lord. Leave with Jehovah not thy present fretfulness merely, but all thy cares; in fact, submit the whole tenor of thy way to him. Cast away anxiety, resign thy will, submit thy judgment, leave all with the God of all. What a medicine is this for expelling envy! What a high attainment does this fourth precept indicate! How blessed must he be who lives every day in obedience to it! "Trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass." Our destiny shall be joyfully accomplished if we confidently entrust all to our Lord.

The poet prays that God would lengthen out, i.e., henceforth preserve (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-12.htm">Psalm 109:12</a>), such mercy to His saints; that the foot of arrogance, which is conceived of as a tyrant, may not come suddenly upon him (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>), and that the hand of the wicked may not drive him from his home into exile (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-18.htm">Psalm 10:18</a>). With &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; alternates &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, which, on its merciful side, is turned towards them that now God, and bestows upon them the promised gracious reward. Whilst the Psalmist is thus praying, the future all at once becomes unveiled to him. Certain in his own mind that his prayer will be heard, he sees the adversaries of God and of His saints for ever overthrown. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>, points to the place where the judgment is executed. The preterites are prophetic, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/64-8.htm">Psalm 64:8-10</a>. The poet, like Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>), beholds the whole tribe of the oppressors of Jahve's Church changed into a field of corpses, without hope of any rising again. </body></html>
