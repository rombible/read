These were the arms, in the use of which, as he frequently complains, they were admirably well skilled.” Thus, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm" title="My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.">Psalm 57:4</a>,) speaking of wicked men, he says, <span class="ital">Whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. </span>And if so, then <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-15.htm" title="Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.">Psalm 37:15</a> “will mean that their intention will be frustrated; they shall not do the mischief they intended; <span class="ital">their bows shall be broken — </span>And their invectives and calumnies shall recoil and do themselves hurt; <span class="ital">their </span>sharp <span class="ital">sword, </span>their false and malicious tongues, <span class="ital">shall pierce through their own soul. </span>And that this was the psalmist’s meaning, who can doubt, after reading <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm" title="Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:">Psalm 64:3</a>, where the wicked doers are said to have <span class="ital">whet their tongue like a sword, and to shoot out their arrows, even bitter words.”</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:7-20 Let us be satisfied that God will make all to work for good to us. Let us not discompose ourselves at what we see in this world. A fretful, discontented spirit is open to many temptations. For, in all respects, the little which is allotted to the righteous, is more comfortable and more profitable than the ill-gotten and abused riches of ungodly men. It comes from a hand of special love. God provides plentifully and well, not only for his working servants, but for his waiting servants. They have that which is better than wealth, peace of mind, peace with God, and then peace in God; that peace which the world cannot give, and which the world cannot have. God knows the believer's days. Not one day's work shall go unrewarded. Their time on earth is reckoned by days, which will soon be numbered; but heavenly happiness shall be for ever. This will be a real support to believers in evil times. Those that rest on the Rock of ages, have no reason to envy the wicked the support of their broken reeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wicked have drawn out the sword - That is, they have prepared themselves with a full purpose to destroy the righteous.<p>And have bent their bow - literally, "have trodden the bow," in allusion to the method by which the bow was bent: to wit, by placing the foot on it, and drawing the string back.<p>To cast down the poor and needy - To cause them to fall.<p>And to slay such as be of upright conversation - Margin, as in Hebrew: "the upright of way."

That is, out of the scabbard; they drew upon the righteous, in order to sheath it in them; or they sharpened the sword, as Aben Ezra observes some interpret the word; it may be literally rendered, "opened the sword" (q), which before lay hid in the scabbard: <p>and have bent their bow; having put the arrow in it, in order to shoot. The former expression may design the more open, and this the more secret way of acting against the righteous; and their view in both is <p>to cast down the poor and needy, who are so, both in a temporal and spiritual sense; to cause such to fall either into sin, or into some calamity or another: <p>and to slay such as be of upright conversation; who walk according to the rule of the word of God, and as becomes the Gospel of Christ: nothing less than the blood and life of these men will satisfy the wicked; and it is an aggravation of their wickedness that they should attempt to hurt men of such character who are poor and needy, holy, harmless, inoffensive, and upright; and this points at the reason why they hate them, and seek their ruin, because of the holiness and uprightness of their lives; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>. <p>(q)  "aperuerunt gladium", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">Sword</span> and <span class="ital">bow</span> are not merely figurative expressions for any means of inflicting injury.
