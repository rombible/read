So it was seen of old, therefore let us not marvel at the matter. We are tempted to fret at this, to think them the only happy people, and so we are prone to do like them: but this we are warned against. Outward prosperity is fading. When we look forward, with an eye of faith, we shall see no reason to envy the wicked. Their weeping and wailing will be everlasting. The life of religion is a believing trust in the Lord, and diligent care to serve him according to his will. It is not trusting God, but tempting him, if we do not make conscience of our duty to him. A man's life consists not in abundance, but, Thou shalt have food convenient for thee. This is more than we deserve, and it is enough for one that is going to heaven. To delight in God is as much a privilege as a duty. He has not promised to gratify the appetites of the body, and the humours of the fancy, but the desires of the renewed, sanctified soul. What is the desire of the heart of a good man? It is this, to know, and love, and serve God. Commit thy way unto the Lord; roll thy way upon the Lord, so the margin reads it. Cast thy burden upon the Lord, the burden of thy care. We must roll it off ourselves, not afflict and perplex ourselves with thoughts about future events, but refer them to God. By prayer spread thy case and all thy cares before the Lord, and trust in him. We must do our duty, and then leave the event with God. The promise is very sweet: He shall bring that to pass, whatever it is, which thou has committed to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light - That is, if you are slandered; if your character is assailed, and seems for the thee to be under a cloud; if reproach comes upon you from the devices of wicked people in such a way that you cannot meet it - then, if you will commit the case to God, he will protect your character, and will cause the clouds to disperse, and all to be as clear in reference to your character and the motives of your conduct as the sun without a cloud. There are numerous cases in which a man cannot meet the assaults made on his reputation, in which he cannot trace to its source a slanderous accusation, in which he cannot immediately explain the circumstances which may have served to give the slanderous report an appearance of probability, but in which he may be perfectly conscious of innocence; and, in such cases, the only resource is to commit the whole matter to God. And there is nothing that may be more safely left with him; nothing that God will more certainly protect than the injured reputation of a good man. Under his administration things will ultimately work themselves right, and a man will have all the reputation which he deserves to have. But he who spends his life in the mere work of defending himself, will soon have a reputation that is not much worth defending. The true way for a man is to do his duty - to do right always - and then commit the whole to God.<p>And thy judgment - Thy just sentence. That is, God will cause justice to be done to your character.<p>As the noon-day - The original word here is in the dual form, and means properly "double-light;" that is, the strongest, brightest light. It means "noon," because the light is then most clear and bright. The idea is, that he will make your character perfectly clear and bright. No cloud will remain on it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

If the prosperity of the wicked frets thee, because it seems to obscure thy righteousness, since while he appears to bask in the sunshine of God's favour, thy life is possibly overshadowed by clouds and darkness, be sure that, in the end, this seeming injustice will be remedied. God will not frown on thee always; one day he will turn on thee the light of his countenance, and make thy righteousness to shine forth like the sun in its noonday splendour. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 36:11-13) Now for the first time, in the concluding hexastich, after complaint and commendation comes the language of prayer. The poet prays that God would lengthen out, i.e., henceforth preserve (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-12.htm">Psalm 109:12</a>), such mercy to His saints; that the foot of arrogance, which is conceived of as a tyrant, may not come suddenly upon him (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>), and that the hand of the wicked may not drive him from his home into exile (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-18.htm">Psalm 10:18</a>). With &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; alternates &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, which, on its merciful side, is turned towards them that now God, and bestows upon them the promised gracious reward. Whilst the Psalmist is thus praying, the future all at once becomes unveiled to him. Certain in his own mind that his prayer will be heard, he sees the adversaries of God and of His saints for ever overthrown. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>, points to the place where the judgment is executed. The preterites are prophetic, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/64-8.htm">Psalm 64:8-10</a>. The poet, like Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>), beholds the whole tribe of the oppressors of Jahve's Church changed into a field of corpses, without hope of any rising again. </body></html>
