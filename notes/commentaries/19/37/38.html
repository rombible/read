What a striking picture is in ver. 35,36, of many a prosperous enemy of God! But God remarkably blights the projects of the prosperous wicked, especially persecutors. None are perfect in themselves, but believers are so in Christ Jesus. If all the saint's days continue dark and cloudy, his dying day may prove comfortable, and his sun set bright; or, if it should set under a cloud, yet his future state will be everlasting peace. The salvation of the righteous will be the Lord's doing. He will help them to do their duties, to bear their burdens; help them to bear their troubles well, and get good by them, and, in due time, will deliver them out of their troubles. Let sinners then depart from evil, and do good; repent of and forsake sin, and trust in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ. Let them take his yoke upon them, and learn of him, that they may dwell for evermore in heaven. Let us mark the closing scenes of different characters, and always depend on God's mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the transgressors - Sinners; violators of the law of God.<p>Shall be destroyed together - The word "together" here - &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;  yacheda&#770;h - means properly "a union of them;" then, together - either:<p>(a) in one place, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-6.htm">Genesis 13:6</a> - or<p>(b) at one time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>; or<p>(c) all as one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a> - or<p>(d) mutually with one another, as when men strive together, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-11.htm">Deuteronomy 25:11</a>.<p>The idea here is, that one would be destroyed as well as another; that there would be no exception; that they would go to the same ruin. They might be destroyed at different times, or in different modes, but it would be the same destruction in the end.<p>The end of the wicked - The future of the wicked. The same word is used here which occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>, as applied to the righteous. The meaning is, that while the "future" of the one would be peace, the future of the other would be a "cutting off," or destruction.<p>Shall be cut off - That is, they shall be cut off; or, there will be a cutting off. This means here, evidently:<p>(a) that as an ordinary fact they would be cut down before they had reached the full limit of their course, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a>;<p>(b) in the future world they would be cut off from hope and happiness forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. together&#8212;at once; entirely (Ps 4:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Together; </span> or, <span class="ital">alike</span>, one as well as another; all, without any exception or respect of persons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The end of the wicked shall be cut off, </span> i. e. he shall be cut off at last, or in the end.

This is to be understood of obstinate and continued transgressors, who live and die in their transgressions; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>; otherwise all men are transgressors in Adam, and sinned and fell with him in his transgression; and are justly called transgressors from the womb; and are guilty of actual transgressions, nor are any clear from them; and are arraigned, convinced, and judged by the law as transgressors; and for many of these Christ died, and makes intercession; and who are converted, and turned from their transgressions; and these are pardoned, and saved, and not destroyed: but stubborn and perverse transgressors are destroyed; not only with a temporal destruction of their substance, and of their names, and they themselves are rooted out of the earth; but with an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and the glory of his power; for this seems to refer to the day of judgment, when all the wicked will be "together"; and shall in a body stand at Christ's left hand, and be bid to go, "ye cursed into everlasting fire", <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>, and shall be turned into hell at once, and together; <p>the end of the wicked shall be cut off; meaning either their posterity, as the word is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>; or their hope and expectation of good things here and hereafter; when the righteous man receives the end of his faith, hope, and expectation, even the salvation of his soul; but these shall be disappointed and frustrated of their end; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a>; or their last end is cutting off from the presence and sight of God, utter ruin and destruction; and so it stands opposed to the end of the perfect and upright man, which is eternal peace and happiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>.
