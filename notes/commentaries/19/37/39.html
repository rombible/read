What a striking picture is in ver. 35,36, of many a prosperous enemy of God! But God remarkably blights the projects of the prosperous wicked, especially persecutors. None are perfect in themselves, but believers are so in Christ Jesus. If all the saint's days continue dark and cloudy, his dying day may prove comfortable, and his sun set bright; or, if it should set under a cloud, yet his future state will be everlasting peace. The salvation of the righteous will be the Lord's doing. He will help them to do their duties, to bear their burdens; help them to bear their troubles well, and get good by them, and, in due time, will deliver them out of their troubles. Let sinners then depart from evil, and do good; repent of and forsake sin, and trust in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ. Let them take his yoke upon them, and learn of him, that they may dwell for evermore in heaven. Let us mark the closing scenes of different characters, and always depend on God's mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord - Or, salvation comes to the righteous from the Lord. While the wicked are cut off, the righteous shall be safe. There are evidently two ideas here:<p>(1) that there will be salvation to the righteous, while the wicked are cut off;<p>(2) that this comes from the Lord, and not from themselves.<p>It is not owing to any power of their own that they are safe, but is solely because they are kept by the Lord.<p>He is their strength in the time of trouble - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39, 40. strength&#8212;(Ps 27:1; 28:8).<p>trouble&#8212;straits (Ps 9:9; 10:1).

Both their temporal, spiritual, and eternal salvation; particularly the latter, which is originally of the Lord, and springs from the thoughts, purposes, and resolutions of his heart: it is of him freely, of his rich grace and abundant mercy; and it is of him fully and completely; it is an entire salvation of soul and body; includes all blessings of grace and glory in it; it is to the uttermost, and from all sin, and every enemy; and it is of him only; there is no salvation in any other; and the glory of it is to be ascribed to him, even to Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit; for all the three divine Persons have a concern in it: the determination, contrivance, and settlement of it, is of Jehovah the Father; the impetration or effecting of it is of Jehovah the Son; and the application of it is of Jehovah the Spirit; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>; <p>he is their strength in the time of trouble; by reason of the hidings of God's face, the temptations of Satan, the prevalence of corruptions, the weakness of grace, and the many afflictions that befall them from God and men; the Lord he is their strong hold and munition of rocks, whither they, betake themselves, and find help, protection, and safety; he puts underneath everlasting arms, bears them up, and upholds them with the right hand of his righteousness; and is the strength of their hearts, of their lives, and of their salvation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> salvation of the righteous <i>is</i> of the LORD: <i>he is</i> their strength in the time of trouble.</span><p>(z) He shows that the patient hope of the godly is never in vain, but in the end has good success, though for a time God proves them by various temptations.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">39</span>. <span class="ital">their strength</span>] R.V. their strong-hold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm" title="The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?">Psalm 27:1</a>); or perhaps <span class="ital">their asylum</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">39, 40</span>.

The last two verses sum up the teaching of the psalm, and indicate its especial object, which was to encourage and sustain the righteous under their trials, by the assurance that they were under the special protection of God, who, whenever trouble threatened, would stand forth as their Strength and Defence, and would ultimately be their "Salvation." The full meaning of this last expression was left obscure, though enough was said to raise the hope that this world was not the end of everything, but rather the beginning. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3</a>., put in contrast with the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; of men, or of human &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#837;.
