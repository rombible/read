So it was seen of old, therefore let us not marvel at the matter. We are tempted to fret at this, to think them the only happy people, and so we are prone to do like them: but this we are warned against. Outward prosperity is fading. When we look forward, with an eye of faith, we shall see no reason to envy the wicked. Their weeping and wailing will be everlasting. The life of religion is a believing trust in the Lord, and diligent care to serve him according to his will. It is not trusting God, but tempting him, if we do not make conscience of our duty to him. A man's life consists not in abundance, but, Thou shalt have food convenient for thee. This is more than we deserve, and it is enough for one that is going to heaven. To delight in God is as much a privilege as a duty. He has not promised to gratify the appetites of the body, and the humours of the fancy, but the desires of the renewed, sanctified soul. What is the desire of the heart of a good man? It is this, to know, and love, and serve God. Commit thy way unto the Lord; roll thy way upon the Lord, so the margin reads it. Cast thy burden upon the Lord, the burden of thy care. We must roll it off ourselves, not afflict and perplex ourselves with thoughts about future events, but refer them to God. By prayer spread thy case and all thy cares before the Lord, and trust in him. We must do our duty, and then leave the event with God. The promise is very sweet: He shall bring that to pass, whatever it is, which thou has committed to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fret not thyself - The Hebrew word here means properly to burn, to be kindled, to be inflamed, and is often applied to anger, as if under its influence we become "heated:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-36.htm">Genesis 31:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm">1 Samuel 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>. Hence, it means to fret oneself, to be angry, or indignant. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-19.htm">Proverbs 24:19</a>. We should perhaps express the same idea by the word "worrying" or "chafing." The state of mind is that where we are worried, or envious, because others are prosperous and successful, and we are not. The idea is, therefore, closely allied with that in the other part of the verse, "neither be thou "envious.""<p>Because of evil-doers - Wicked men:<p>(a) at the fact that there are wicked men, or that God suffers them to live;<p>(b) at their numbers;<p>(c) at their success and prosperity.<p>Neither be thou envious - Envy is pain, mortification, discontent, at the superior excellence or prosperity of others, accompanied often with some degree of malignant feeling, and with a disposition to detract from their merit. It is the result of a comparison of ourselves with others who are more highly gifted or favored, or who are more successful than we are ourselves. The feeling referred to here is that which springs up in the mind when we see persons of corrupt or wicked character prospered, while we, endeavoring to do right, are left to poverty, to disappointment, and to tears. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 37<p>Ps 37:1-40. A composed and uniform trust in God and a constant course of integrity are urged in view of the blessedness of the truly pious, contrasted in various aspects with the final ruin of the wicked. Thus the wisdom and justice of God's providence are vindicated, and its seeming inequalities, which excite the cavils of the wicked and the distrust of the pious, are explained. David's personal history abundantly illustrates the Psalm.<p>1, 2. The general sentiment of the whole Psalm is expressed. The righteous need not be vexed by the prosperity of the wicked; for it is transient, and their destiny undesirable.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/37.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.<p>2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a><p>The Psalm opens with the first precept. It is alas! too common for believers in their hours of adversity to think themselves harshly dealt with when they see persons utterly destitute of religion and honesty, rejoicing in abundant prosperity. Much needed is the command, "Fret not thyself because of evildoers." To fret is to worry, to have the heart-burn, to fume, to become vexed. Nature is very apt to kindle a fire of jealousy when it sees law-breakers riding on horses, and obedient subjects walking in the mire: it is a lesson learned only in the school of grace, when one comes to view the most paradoxical providences with the devout complacency of one who is sure that the Lord is righteous in all his acts. It seems hard to carnal judgments that the best meat should go to the dogs, while loving children pine for want of it. "Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity." The same advice under another shape. When one is poor, despised, and in deep trial, our old Adam naturally becomes envious of the rich and great; and when we are conscious that we have been more righteous than they, the devil is sure to be at hand with blasphemous reasonings. Stormy weather may curdle even the cream of humanity. Evil men instead of being envied, are to be viewed with horror and aversion; yet their loaded tables, and gilded trappings, are too apt to fascinate our poor haft-opened eyes. Who envies the fat bullock the ribbons and garlands which decorate him as he is led to the shambles? Yet the case is a parallel one; for ungodly rich men are but as beasts fattened for the slaughter.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a><p>"For they shall soon be cut down like the grass." The scythe of death is sharpening. Green grows the grass, but quick comes the scythe. The destruction of the ungodly will be speedy, sudden, sure, overwhelming, irretrievable. The grass cannot resist or escape the mower. "And wither as the green herb." The beauty of the herb dries up at once in the heat of the sun, and so all the glory of the wicked shall disappear at the hour of death. Death kills the ungodly man like grass, and wrath withers him like hay; he dies, and his name rots. How complete an end is made of the man whose boasts had no end! Is it worth while to waste ourselves in fretting about the insect of an hour, an ephemera which in the same day is born and dies? Within believers there is a living and incorruptible seed which liveth and abideth for ever; why should they envy mere flesh, and the glory of it, which are but as grass, and the flower thereof? <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The design of this Psalm is to defend the providence of God, and to satisfy the minds of men in that great question, concerning the seeming inequality of God’s dispensations, in afflicting good men, and giving prosperity to the worst of men; and to instruct God’s people how to demean themselves in their present condition, and what supports and comforts they have in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The psalmist persuadeth to patience and confidence in God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/37-1.htm" title="Fret not yourself because of evildoers, neither be you envious against the workers of iniquity....">Psalm 37:1-8</a></span>; and showeth the different state of the godly and wicked in all their dealings, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/37-9.htm" title="For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait on the LORD, they shall inherit the earth....">Psalm 37:9-40</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">Fret not thyself, </span> give not way to immoderate grief, or anger, or impatience, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">because of evil-doers; </span> because they prosper in their wicked enterprises, whilst thou art sorely afflicted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither be thou envious, </span> esteeming them happy, and secretly wishing that thou wert in their condition. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Fret not thyself because of evildoers,....

According to Aristotle, we have a special emotion implanted in our nature - <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - which causes us to "fret" when we witness undeserved prosperity ('Rhet.,' 2:9, &sect; 1). Certainly the feeling is very common and very strong; it is also characteristic of the best natures (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15</a>). The feeling does not need to be eradicated, but only to be held in check. Faith in God's retributive justice will enable us calmly to await "the end" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>), in full assurance that ultimately God's vengeance will overtake the wicked man, and he will receive condign punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity</span>. Envy is not a natural passion. To envy the evil-doers on account of their prosperity is at once a folly and a danger. Their position is really not enviable; and, if we allow ourselves to envy them, we shall be tempted to follow their example (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 36:6-10) The poet now turns from this repulsive prospect to one that is more pleasing. He contemplates, and praises, the infinite, ever sure mercy of God, and the salvation, happiness, and light which spring from it. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the expression is &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the syncope of the article not taking place. &#1489;&#1468; alternating with &#1506;&#1491;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-11.htm">Psalm 57:11</a>, has here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>, the sense of touching or reaching to the spot that is denoted in connection with it. The poet describes the exaltation and super-eminence of divine mercy and faithfulness figuratively, after earthly standards. They reveal themselves on earth in a height that reaches to the heavens and extends to &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., the thin veil of vapour which spreads itself like a veil over the depths of the heavens; they transcend all human thought, desire, and comprehension (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-11.htm">Psalm 103:11</a>, and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>). The &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; (righteousness) is distinguished from the &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; (faithfulness) thus: the latter is governed by the promises of God, the former by His holiness; and further, the latter has its being in the love of God, the former, on the other hand, manifests itself partly as justifying in mercies, and partly as avenging in wrath. Concerning the righteousness, the poet says that it is like the mountains of God, i.e., (cf. cedars of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-11.htm">Psalm 80:11</a>) unchangeably firm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>), like the giant primeval mountains which bear witness to the greatness and glory of God; concerning God's judgments, that they are "a great deep," incomprehensible and unsearchable (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>) as the great, deep-surging mass of waters in the lower parts of the earth, which becomes visible in the seas and in the rivers. God's punitive righteousness, as at length becomes evident, has His compassion for its reverse side; and this, as in the case of the Flood (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>), embraces the animal world, which is most closely involved, whether for weal or for woe, with man, as well as mankind.<p>Lost in this depth, which is so worthy of adoration, the Psalmist exclaims: How precious (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>) is Thy mercy, Elohim! i.e., how valuable beyond all treasures, and how precious to him who knows how to prize it! The Waw of &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; is the explicative Waw  equals  et hoc ipsum quod. The energetic form of the future, &#1497;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, has the pre-tonic Kametz, here in pause, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-44.htm">Psalm 78:44</a>. The shadow of God's wings is the protection of His love, which hides against temptation and persecution. To be thus hidden in God is the most unspeakable blessedness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a> : they satiate themselves, they drink full draughts of "the fatness of Thy house." The house of God is His sanctuary, and in general the domain of His mercy and grace. &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; (cf. &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>) is the expression for the abundant, pleasant, and powerful gifts and goods and recreations with which God entertains those who are His; and &#1512;&#1493;&#1492; (whence &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1503;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-13.htm">Deuteronomy 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>) is the spiritual joy of the soul that experiences God's mercy to overflowing. The abundant fare of the priests from Jahve's table (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a>), and the festive joy of the guests at the shelamim-offering, i.e., the communion-offering, - these outward rites are here treated according to their spiritual significance, receive the depth of meaning which radically belongs to them, and are ideally generalized. It is a stream of pleasures (&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;) with which He irrigates and fertilizes them, a paradisaic river of delights. This, as the four arms of the river of Paradise had one common source (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>), has its spring in God, yea, God is the fountain itself. He is "the fountain of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>); all life flows forth from Him, who is the absolutely existing and happy One. The more inwardly, therefore, one is joined to Him, the fuller are the draughts of life which he drinks from this first fountain of all life. And as God is the fountain of life, so also is He the fountain of light: "In Thy light do we see light;" out of God, seeing we see only darkness, whereas immersed in God's sea of light we are illumined by divine knowledge, and lighted up with spiritual joy. The poet, after having taken a few glimpses into the chaos of evil, here moves in the blessed depths of holy mysticism [Mystik, i.e., mysticism in the good sense - true religion, vital godliness], and in proportion as in the former case his language is obscure. So here it is clear as crystal. </body></html>
