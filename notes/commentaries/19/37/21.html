It is a great sin for those that are able, to deny the payment of just debts; it is a great misery not to be able to pay them. He that is truly merciful, will be ever merciful. We must leave our sins; learn to do well, and cleave to it. This is true religion. The blessing of God is the spring, sweetness, and security of all earthly enjoyments. And if we are sure of this, we are sure not to want any thing good for us in this world. By his grace and Holy Spirit, he directs the thoughts, affections, and designs of good men. By his providence he overrules events, so as to make their way plain. He does not always show them his way for a distance, but leads them step by step, as children are led. God will keep them from being ruined by their falls, either into sin or into trouble, though such as fall into sin will be sorely hurt. Few, if any, have known the consistent believer, or his children, reduced to abject, friendless want. God forsakes not his saints in affliction; and in heaven only the righteous shall dwell for ever; that will be their everlasting habitation. A good man may fall into the hands of a messenger of Satan, and be sorely buffeted, but God will not leave him in his enemy's hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again - This is probably intended here, not so much to describe the "character" as the "condition" of the wicked. The idea is, that he will be in such a condition of want that he will be under a necessity of borrowing, but will not have the means of repaying what he has borrowed, while the righteous will not only have enough for himself, but will have the means of showing mercy to others, and of "giving" to them what they need. The ability to lend to others is referred to as a part of the promise of God to his people, and as marking their condition as a prosperous one, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-6.htm">Deuteronomy 15:6</a> : "And thou shalt lend unto many nations, and shalt not borrow." Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-44.htm">Deuteronomy 28:44</a>. It is true, however, as a characteristic of a wicked man, that he will often be "disposed" to borrow and not pay again; that he will be "reckless" about borrowing and careless about paying; and that it is a characteristic of a good or upright man that he will not borrow when he can avoid it, and that he will be punctual and conscientious in paying what he has borrowed.<p>But the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth - That is, in this connection, he is not under the necessity of borrowing of others for the supply of his wants. He has not only enough for himself, but he has the means of aiding others, and has the disposition to do it. It is his "character" to show favors, and he has the means of gratifying this desire.<p>And giveth - Imparts to others. He has enough for himself, and has also that which he can give to others. Of course all this is designed to be general. It does not mean that this will universaly be the case, but that the tendency of a life of piety is to make a man prosperous in his worldly affairs; to give him what he needs for himself, and to furnish him with the means, as he has the disposition, to do good to others. Other things being equal, the honest, temperate, pure, pious man will be the most prosperous in the world: for honesty, temperance, purity, and piety produce the industry, economy, and prudence on which prosperity depends. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21, 22. payeth not&#8212;not able; having grown poor (compare De 15:7).

While the wicked live, they are scandalous; they live by borrowing, which was always reckoned mean; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>; and what is worse, as they borrow, they do not design to repay; they take no care nor thought about that, but live upon what they borrow: for this either expresses their incapacity that they cannot pay; or the evil disposition of their mind, which rather seems to be the sense, that they will not pay; <p>but the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth; which not only argues capacity and ability, but a kind, merciful, and tender spirit to persons in distress, and is expressive of a generous action. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> giveth.</span><p>(o) God so furnishes him with high blessings, that he is able to help others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. At first sight it may seem that the Psalmist intends to contrast the dishonesty of the wicked with the liberality of the righteous. But <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-22.htm" title="For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.">Psalm 37:22</a></span> makes it clear that this is not the meaning. Looking forward, he foresees the future which awaits them. He sees the wicked man falling into debt and forced to contract loans which he cannot repay, while the righteous man has enough and to spare, and makes a bountiful use of his wealth. The promise to Israel as a nation finds its analogy within the nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-6.htm" title="For the LORD your God blesses you, as he promised you: and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over you.">Deuteronomy 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm" title="The LORD shall open to you his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain to your land in his season, and to bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend to many nations, and you shall not borrow.">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-44.htm" title="He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.">Deuteronomy 28:44</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sheweth mercy</span>] Better as R.V., dealeth graciously.

The wicked man borrows with a light heart, though he may have no prospect of ever being able to repay. Living under God's curse (ver. 22), he is for the most part not able to repay; when he happens to be able, he is often not willing. <span class="cmt_word">But the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5, 9</a>). The righteous has not often need to borrow (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-6.htm">Deuteronomy 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12, 44</a>).
