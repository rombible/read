Commentary</span>) widens the promise and lifts it to a higher level. The quiet, unpretending, contented servant of God gets more true blessedness out of the earth, and so more truly possesses it, than the ungodly, though they be lords of broad acres.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:7-20 Let us be satisfied that God will make all to work for good to us. Let us not discompose ourselves at what we see in this world. A fretful, discontented spirit is open to many temptations. For, in all respects, the little which is allotted to the righteous, is more comfortable and more profitable than the ill-gotten and abused riches of ungodly men. It comes from a hand of special love. God provides plentifully and well, not only for his working servants, but for his waiting servants. They have that which is better than wealth, peace of mind, peace with God, and then peace in God; that peace which the world cannot give, and which the world cannot have. God knows the believer's days. Not one day's work shall go unrewarded. Their time on earth is reckoned by days, which will soon be numbered; but heavenly happiness shall be for ever. This will be a real support to believers in evil times. Those that rest on the Rock of ages, have no reason to envy the wicked the support of their broken reeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the meek shall inherit the earth - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3</a>. On the meaning of the word here rendered "meek," see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-12.htm">Psalm 9:12</a>, where it is rendered "humble." The word properly denotes those who are afflicted, distressed, needy; then, those who are of humble rank in life; then, the mild, the gentle, the meek. The term here is a general one to denote those who are the friends of God, considered as meek, mild, gentle, humble, in contradistinction from the wicked who are proud and haughty; perhaps also, in this connection, in contrast with the wicked as prosperous in life. It was probably this passage that the Saviour quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>.<p>And shall delight themselves - <p>(a) Shall "prefer" what is here referred to as the source of their happiness, or as in accordance with the desires of their hearts;<p>(b) shall "find" actual delight or happiness in this.<p>Though not rich and prospered in this world as the wicked often are, yet they will have their own sources of enjoyment, and will find happiness in what they prefer.<p>In the abundance of peace - In abundant peace. In the tranquility and quietness in which they spend their lives, in contrast with the jealousies, the contentions, and the strifes which exist among the wicked even when prosperous. They will have peace with God <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-11.htm">Psalm 29:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-8.htm">Psalm 85:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-165.htm">Psalm 119:165</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>; they will have peace in their own consciences; they will have peace in the calmness of a quiet and contented spirit; they will have peace with those around them, as they have no passions to gratify, and no object to secure, which will excite the envy, or stir up the wrath, of others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. peace&#8212;includes prosperity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The meek, i.e. the godly, who are frequently thus called, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm" title="The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.">Psalm 22:26</a> 149:4</span>; those who patiently bear God’s afflicting hand, and meekly pass by injuries from ungodly men.

Our Lord seems to refer to this passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>; <p>and shall delight themselves is the abundance of peace; of spiritual peace enjoyed in a way of believing, arising from a comfortable view of interest in the blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of Christ; and of all happiness and prosperity in the kingdom of Christ here on earth, at which time there will be abundance of peace, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>; or of eternal peace in the world to come, which will be a state of uninterrupted and unspeakable peace; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>; all which afford inconceivable delight and pleasure; and therefore such have no need to fret and be envious at the fading happiness of wicked men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.
