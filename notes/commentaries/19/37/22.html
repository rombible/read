It is a great sin for those that are able, to deny the payment of just debts; it is a great misery not to be able to pay them. He that is truly merciful, will be ever merciful. We must leave our sins; learn to do well, and cleave to it. This is true religion. The blessing of God is the spring, sweetness, and security of all earthly enjoyments. And if we are sure of this, we are sure not to want any thing good for us in this world. By his grace and Holy Spirit, he directs the thoughts, affections, and designs of good men. By his providence he overrules events, so as to make their way plain. He does not always show them his way for a distance, but leads them step by step, as children are led. God will keep them from being ruined by their falls, either into sin or into trouble, though such as fall into sin will be sorely hurt. Few, if any, have known the consistent believer, or his children, reduced to abject, friendless want. God forsakes not his saints in affliction; and in heaven only the righteous shall dwell for ever; that will be their everlasting habitation. A good man may fall into the hands of a messenger of Satan, and be sorely buffeted, but God will not leave him in his enemy's hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For such as be blessed of him - They who are his true friends.<p>Shall inherit the earth - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a>.<p>And they that be cursed of him - His enemies.<p>Shall be cut off - <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a>. This verse suggests a thought of great importance, in advance of that which had been suggested before. It is that, after all, the difference in the ultimate condition of the two depends on the question whether they have, or have not, "the favor of the Lord." It is not on the mere fact of their own skill, but it is on the fact that the one has secured the divine favor, and that the other has not. It is not by mere human virtue, irrespective of God, that the result is determined; but it is that one is the friend of God, and the other not. This consideration will be found in the end to enter essentially into all the distinctions in the final condition of mankind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. cut off&#8212;opposed to "inherit the earth" (compare Le 7:20, 21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of him, </span> i.e. of the Lord, as appears both from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-20.htm" title="But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.">Psalm 37:20</a></span>, where he is named, and from the nature of the thing, this being God’s prerogative to bless or to curse men.

Not of the righteous man; for he blesses them that curse and persecute him, and despitefully use him; but of the Lord, as the Syriac version expresses it; or by the Word of the Lord, as the Targum; both in a providential way, for it is the blessing of the Lord that makes rich, and puts into a capacity to give to others; and in a way of grace, with an interest in God as a covenant God in Christ; and with the blessings of grace in him, with a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, and a right to eternal glory. The Septuagint version, and those that follow that, render the words actively, "such as bless him"; either such as bless the righteous, who are blessed also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; or rather such as bless the Lord, as the righteous do, for all their blessings temporal and spiritual they receive from him; these <p>shall inherit the earth; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a>; <p>and they that be cursed of him; not of the righteous man, but of the Lord, according to the tenor of his righteous law, which they have broken: <p>shall be cut off; out of the land of the living; many of them in the midst of their days, and shall everlastingly perish. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">For</span> &c.] The wicked man’s ruin and the righteous man’s ability to do good proceed respectively from the curse and the blessing of God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For such as be blessed of him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) shall inherit the earth (see above, ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">And they that be cursed of him shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be out off</span> (see above, ver. 9). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-16.htm">Psalm 37:16</a> accord <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>, cf.
