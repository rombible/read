We are complete in him. The man that walks in his integrity, yet trusting wholly in the grace of God, is in a state of acceptance, according to the covenant of which Jesus was the Mediator, in virtue of his spotless obedience even unto death. This man desires to have his inmost soul searched and proved by the Lord. He is aware of the deceitfulness of his own heart; he desires to detect and mortify every sin; and he longs to be satisfied of his being a true believer, and to practise the holy commands of God. Great care to avoid bad company, is both a good evidence of our integrity, and a good means to keep us in it. Hypocrites and dissemblers may be found attending on God's ordinances; but it is a good sign of sincerity, if we attend upon them, as the psalmist here tells us he did, in the exercise of repentance and conscientious obedience. He feels his ground firm under him; and, as he delights in blessing the Lord with his congregations on earth, he trusts that shortly he shall join the great assembly in heaven, in singing praises to God and to the Lamb for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My foot standeth in an even place - The word rendered "even place" - &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;  m&#305;&#770;ysho&#770;r - means properly "righteousness," or "justice;" then, "evenness, a level region, a plain:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-16.htm">Isaiah 42:16</a>. DeWette renders it, "in a right path." The idea is, either that he was standing now on smooth and level ground; or that he was walking in a straight path, in contradistinction from the crooked and perverse ways of the wicked; that is, he had found now a level road where he might walk securely. The latter is probably the true meaning. He had been anxious about his condition. He had been examining the evidences of his piety. He had had doubts and fears. He had seen much to apprehend, and he had appealed to God to determine the question on which he was so anxious - whether his hope was built on a solid foundation. His path in these inquiries, and while his mind was thus troubled, was like a journey over a rough and dangerous road - a road of hills and valleys - of rocks and ravines. Now he had found a smooth and safe path. The way was level. He felt secure; and he walked calmly and safely along, as a traveler does who has past over dangerous passes and who feels that he is on level ground. The idea is, that his doubts had been dissipated, and he now felt that his evidences of piety were well founded, and that he was truly a child of God.<p>In the congregations will I bless the Lord - In the assemblies of his people will I praise him. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>. The meaning is, that in the great assembly he would offer special praise that God had resolved his doubts, and had given him so clear evidence that he was truly his friend. He would go to the house of God, and there render to Him public praise that he had been able to find the evidence which he desired. No act could be more appropriate than such an act of praise, for there is nothing for which we should render more hearty thanks than for any evidence that we are truly the friends of God, and have a well-founded hope of heaven. The whole psalm should lead us carefully to examine the evidences of our piety; to bring before God all that we rely on as proof that we are His friends; and to pray that He will enable us to examine it aright; and, when the result is, as it was in the case of the psalmist - when we can feel that we have reached a level place and found a smooth path, then we should go, as he did, and offer hearty thanks to God that we have reason to believe we are His children and are heirs of salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. even place&#8212;free from occasions of stumbling&#8212;safety in his course is denoted.

Saints often sing themselves into happiness. The even place upon which our foot stands is the sure, covenant faithfulness, eternal promise and immutable oath of the Lord of Hosts; there is no fear of falling from this solid basis, or of its being removed from under us. Established in Christ Jesus, by being vitally united to him, we have nothing left to occupy our thoughts but the praises of our God. Let us not forsake the assembling of ourselves together, and when assembled, let us not be slow to contribute our portion of thanksgiving. Each saint is a witness to divine faithfulness, and should be ready with his testimony. As for the slanderers, let them howl outside the door while the children sing within. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In an even place, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">in rectitude</span>, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in a right, or straight, or plain, or even place; </span> which may be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Faith realises the answer to its prayer as already granted, and security assured.

And, in general, the expression of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>. takes a priestly form, without exceeding that which the ritual admits of, by virtue of the consciousness of being themselves priests which appertained even to the Israelitish laity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). For &#1505;&#1489;&#1489; can be used even of half encompassing as it were like a semi-circle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>), no matter whether it be in the immediate vicinity of, or at a prescribed distance from, the central point. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is a syncopated and defectively written Hiph., for &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;, like &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-11.htm">Isaiah 23:11</a>.

In the expression "all Thy wondrous works" is included the latest of these, to which the voice of thanksgiving especially refers, viz., the bringing of him home from the exile he had suffered from Absolom. Longing to be back again he longs most of all for the gorgeous services in the house of his God, which are performed around the altar of the outer court; for he loves the habitation of the house of God, the place, where His doxa, - revealed on earth, and in fact revealed in grace, - has taken up its abode. ma`own does not mean refuge, shelter (Hupfeld), - for although it may obtain this meaning from the context, it has nothing whatever to do with Arab. &#8219;a&#770;n, med. Waw, in the signification to help (whence ma&#8219;u&#770;n, ma&#8219;u&#770;ne, ma&#8219;a&#770;ne, help, assistance, succour or support), - but place, dwelling, habitation, like the Arabic ma&#8219;a&#770;n, which the Kamus explains by menzil, a place to settle down in, and explains etymologically by Arab. mh&#803;ll 'l-&#8219;&#305;&#770;n, i.e., "a spot on which the eye rests as an object of sight;" for in the Arabic ma&#8219;a&#770;n is traced back to Arab. &#8219;a&#770;n, med. Je, as is seen from the phrase hum minka bi-ma&#8219;a&#770;nin, i.e., they are from thee on a point of sight ( equals  on a spot where thou canst see them from the spot on which thou standest). The signification place, sojourn, abode (Targ. &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;) is undoubted; the primary meaning of the root is, however, questionable. </body></html>
