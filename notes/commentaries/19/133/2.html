Literally, <span class= "ital">Like the oil, the good oil, on the head descending upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, which </span>(<span class= "ital">was</span>)<span class= "ital"> descending to the mouth of his robes. </span>Oil meets us as the standing symbol of joy and festivity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>, Note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm" title="To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.">Isaiah 61:3</a>.)

But while this association, as also the pleasure derived from the fragrance of the oil, would be present here as always in the truly Oriental image, its elaboration in this passage points to a further purpose. It is the holy oil, that whose composition is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-22.htm" title="Moreover the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Exodus 30:22-23</a>, that the poet alludes to.

It would run down his neck to the <span class= "ital">collar </span>of the priestly robe. That this is the meaning of “mouth” here is plain from the actual description of the sacerdotal garments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31-32</a>): “And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. And there shall be a <span class= "ital">mouth </span>in the top of it, in the midst thereof: and it shall have a binding of woven work round about the <span class= "ital">mouth </span>of it, as it were the <span class= "ital">mouth </span>of a habergeon, that it be not rent.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-23.htm" title="And there was an hole in the middle of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.">Exodus 39:23</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm" title="By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it binds me about as the collar of my coat.">Job 30:18</a>, where Authorised Version has “collar.”) To the ideas of “joy” and “fragrance,” therefore, must also be added that of “consecration.” But the point of the comparison does not lie even here; nor is it in the <span class= "ital">freshness </span>of the dew, in the next verse, or its <span class= "ital">abundance, </span>though dew suggests both of these (see Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm" title="Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.">Psalm 110:3</a>), but in the word three times repeated—<span class= "ital">descending. </span>Our version unfortunately obscures this point, by rendering this recurrent participle each time by a different word, missing, at the same time, the marked peculiarity of the rhythm of these psalms. The oil descends from Aaron’s head over his face and beard; the dew of Hermon descends on Zion—low in actual measurement, but exalted by the Divine favour above the loftiest hills. It is not <span class= "ital">unity, </span>then, in itself which is the subject of the poem, but the unity of the <span class= "ital">covenant </span>under which all blessings <span class= "ital">flowed down </span>from above, rested on Mount Zion, and took outward shape and form there in the political and religious constitution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/133.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-2.htm" title="It is like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;">Psalm 133:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">It is like the precious ointment, </span>&c. — It is no less grateful and refreshing than that holy anointing oil, which was strongly perfumed, and diffused its fragrance all around, to the great delight of all present, when it was poured upon the head of Aaron, at the time of his consecration to the priestly office, so plentifully, that it ran down his face, even to the collar or binding of his garment. “This verse is explained by Exodus 13:23, &c., where God gave directions concerning the ointment which was to anoint Aaron and his sons. It was to be composed of several rich spices, which, by being rightly tempered and mixed together, yielded a most fragrant odour, and thus became a most expressive emblem of unanimity and concord, in a well-cemented society; all jointly conspiring and contributing, according to their various capacities, tempers, and conditions, to the good of the whole.” — Dodd. Dr. Hammond carries this comparison further, and supposes that this anointing oil, being said to go down to the skirts of Aaron’s garments, implies that unity is a blessing to the subject, as well as to the governor; to the meanest person in the society, as well as the greatest; which is an undoubted truth, though, perhaps, it might not be intended here by the psalmist.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/133.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>133:1-3 The excellency of brotherly love. - We cannot say too much, it were well if enough could be said, to persuade people to live together in peace. It is good for us, for our honour and comfort; and brings constant delight to those who live in unity. The pleasantness of this is likened to the holy anointing oil. This is the fruit of the Spirit, the proof of our union with Christ, and adorns his gospel. It is profitable as well as pleasing; it brings blessings numerous as the drops of dew. It cools the scorching heat of men's passions, as the dews cool the air and refresh the earth. It moistens the heart, and makes it fit to receive the good seed of the word, and to make it fruitful. See the proof of the excellency of brotherly love: where brethren dwell together in unity, the Lord commands the blessing. God commands the blessing; man can but beg a blessing. Believers that live in love and peace, shall have the God of love and peace with them now, and they shall shortly be with him for ever, in the world of endless love and peace.

The Hebrew is, "the good ointment." For a description of the ointment which was used in the consecration of the high priest, and the holy things of the sanctuary, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-30</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>, on the phrase "oil of joy." Anointing with oil was common on festivals and joyous occasions (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>), and hence, it became an emblem of anything joyous, happy, beautiful; and the idea seemed to be carried to the highest degree when it was connected with the anointing of a high priest to the sacred duties of his office. There is no other resemblance between the idea of anointing with oil and that of harmony among brethren than this which is derived from the gladness - the joyousness - connected with such an anointing. The psalmist wished to give the highest idea of the pleasantness of such harmony; and he, therefore, compared it with that which was most beautiful to a pious mind - the idea of a solemn consecration to the highest office of religion. The comparison is one which would not unnaturally occur to a Jew.<p>That ran down upon the beard - Descending from the head upon the long, flowing beard. The idea here is that of copiousness, or abundance - as if so much ointment was poured forth as to descend on the whole person, consecrating the entire man.<p>Even Aaron's beard - The word "even" here, introduced by our translators, weakens the force and beauty of the comparison. The psalmist had the simple image of Aaron before his mind, without intending to compare him with any other.<p>That went down to the skirts of his garments - literally, "to the mouth of his garment." The idea is that the anointing oil was abundant enough to flow down so as to fall on his entire robe, diffusing a sweet fragrance all around. It is possible, though it may seem like a conceit, that the psalmist may have had an idea of unity in this, as if in the anointing of the high priest the whole man was consecrated, or was "united" in the consecration. It was not merely the head, but the beard, the raiment, the entire person, that partook of the fragrance of the anointing oil. Thus love in a Christian community is so abundant - so overflowing - that it spreads over all the spiritual body, the church; the same sweet and holy influence, represented by the oil of anointing, pervades all, and combines all in one. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/133.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 133<p>Ps 133:1-3. The blessings of fraternal unity.<p>1, 2. As the fragrant oil is refreshing, so this affords delight. The holy anointing oil for the high priest was olive oil mixed with four of the best spices (Ex 30:22, 25, 30). Its rich profusion typified the abundance of the Spirit's graces. As the copious dew, such as fell on Hermon, falls in fertilizing power on the mountains of Zion, so this unity is fruitful in good works.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/133.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is no less grateful and refreshing than that oil which was plentifully poured forth upon Aaron’s head at the time of his consecration to the priestly office, which was exceeding pleasant, not only for the extraordinary fragrancy of it, but because by this, together with the other rites prescribed, he was initiated into that sacred office, which was so acceptable to God, and so comfortable and beneficial to the people, as being the happy instrument of making atonement to God for them, and of procuring and maintaining their peace with God, upon which all their happiness of this life and of the next depends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Skirts; </span> or, <span class="ital">skirt</span>; for the Hebrew word is of the singular number. Not to the lower skirt or bottom of his sacerdotal garment, for that the sacred oil was poured forth in so great plenty is not probable, nor was it necessary or convenient; but to the upper skirt of it, or the mouth of it, as this Hebrew word properly signifies; or to the collar of his upper priestly garment, which the ointment falling upon his beard might easily reach. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/133.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is like the precious ointment upon the head,.... The composition which Moses was ordered to make of the principal spices, and therefore called precious; and which was poured on the heads of kings and priests, when they were anointed with it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; <p>that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard; this was put upon the head of Aaron when he was anointed, and so on any other high priest, and trickled down to his beard; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a>. The reasons Kimchi and Ben Melech give, why the anointing of Aaron and other priests is mentioned, and not the anointing of a king, or of David himself, are, because the anointing of Aaron was first, and also more public and better known by the people; <p>that went down to the skirts of his garments; or, "the mouth" or "opening of his garments" (a); not the extremity of them, as our version inclines to; for not so great a quantity of oil was poured upon him; nor would it have been decent to have his clothes thus greased from top to bottom: but the upper part of his garment, the top of the coat, on which the beard lay, as Jarchi; the neck or collar of it, as Kimchi and Ben Melech; the hole in which the head went through when it was put on, about which there was a band, that it might not be rent, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-32.htm">Exodus 28:32</a>; where the Septuagint use the same word as here. Suidas (b) says, David means the superior aperture of the garment, that which we call the neck or collar band; and so Theodoret: and the Arabic version renders it, the "aperture", or opening of it; and hitherto the ointment came. This was typical of the grace of the Spirit, the unction from the Holy One; which has been poured on Christ, the head of the church, without measure; and with which he has been anointed above his fellows; and from him it is communicated to all his members; to every one of which is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ; and who from his fulness receive, and grace for grace: and particularly brotherly love is compared to this ointment; because of the preciousness of it, which is true of every grace; and because of the extensiveness of it, reaching to head and members, to Christ and all his saints, the meanest and lowest of them; and because of its fragrancy and sweet odour to all that are sensible of it; and because of its delightful, cheering, and refreshing nature; like ointment and perfume it rejoices the heart; yea, the worst things said, or reproofs given, in brotherly love, are like oil, pleasant and useful, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-9.htm">Proverbs 27:9</a>; and is as necessary for the saints, who are all priests unto God, to offer up their spiritual sacrifices; particularly that of prayer, which should be "without wrath", as well as without doubting; and to do all other duties of religion, which should spring from charity or love; as the anointing oil was to Aaron and his sons, in order to their officiating in the priest's office. <p>(a)   , Sept.

The brotherly concord of the dwellers in Jerusalem is compared to the sacred oil with which the High-priest was anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm" title="Take you also to you principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,">Exodus 30:23</a> ff.). This sacred oil was <span class="ital">poured</span> upon Aaron’s head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm" title="And he poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10</a>) when he was consecrated to the office of high-priest, whereas the ordinary priests were only sprinkled with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-21.htm" title="And you shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Exodus 29:21</a>). It would flow down upon his beard and on to his shoulders and his breast, upon which he bore the names of the Twelve Tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-9.htm" title="And you shall take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:...">Exodus 28:9-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/28-17.htm" title="And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row....">Exodus 28:17-21</a>), symbolising thereby the consecration of the whole nation of which he was the representative. The stream of perfumed oil, carefully compounded with aromatic spices, would diffuse its fragrance all around, symbolising the holy influence which should emanate from the chief religious representative of Israel, and from the nation which he represented. The point of the simile then seems to be, that as the sacred oil flowed down over Aaron’s shoulders, so the harmonious unity of those who dwell in Jerusalem will influence the whole nation for good. The same spirit will be diffused throughout the whole community. Cp. Psalms 122.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Aaron</span> might denote any high-priest; but the Psalmist by the use of the present participles seems rather to intend to recall the scene of the consecration of Aaron himself (Leviticus 8). It might have been thought that he was alluding to some recent ceremony; but according to Jewish tradition, the sacred oil was wanting in the time of the Second Temple, and the high-priest was consecrated by investiture with the pontifical robes only.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is a question whether the clause <span class="ital">which descendeth upon the collar of his garments</span> refers to the oil or to Aaron’s beard. The Massoretic accentuation (unless it is to be regarded as rhythmical and not syntactical) makes it refer to Aaron’s beard: the Ancient Versions take it to refer to the oil. In the former case the beard is thought of as connecting the head and the garments; but the latter interpretation is the more natural, and is supported by the fondness of the Psalms of Ascent for the repetition of words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The collar</span> not <span class="ital">the skirts</span> of the high-priest’s garment is denoted by the Heb. word, which means literally ‘mouth’ or ‘opening,’ i.e. the hole through which the head passed, or its bordering.

Not only Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>), but all later high priests, were anointed with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-30.htm">Exodus 30:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard</span>.

His second blessing refers to the priests, for by means of these He will keep up His intercourse with His people. He makes the priesthood of Zion a real institution of salvation: He clothes her priests with salvation, so that they do not merely bring it about instrumentally, but personally possess it, and their whole outward appearance is one which proclaims salvation. And to all her saints He gives cause and matter for high and lasting joy, by making Himself known also to the church, in which He has taken up His abode, in deeds of mercy (loving-kindness or grace). There (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>) in Zion is indeed the kingship of promise, which cannot fail of fulfilment.
