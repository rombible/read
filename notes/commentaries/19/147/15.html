The thawing word may represent the gospel of Christ, and the thawing wind the Spirit of Christ; for the Spirit is compared to the wind, Joh 3:8. Converting grace softens the heart that was hard frozen, and melts it into tears of repentance, and makes good reflections to flow, which before were chilled and stopped up. The change which the thaw makes is very evident, yet how it is done no one can say. Such is the change wrought in the conversion of a soul, when God's word and Spirit are sent to melt it and restore it to itself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/147.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth - That is, with reference to the productions of the earth; to the changes which occur; to the seasons; to snow, frost, ice, cold, heat, wind; and he is universally and immediately obeyed.

Which Kimchi interprets of rain, which causes the wheat to grow; since afterwards mention is made of snow, and of hoar frost and ice. Aben Ezra understands it of the decree of God, which he executes on earth. The Targum, of the "Memra", or Word of the Lord; the essential Word, the Messiah; whom the Lord sent on earth to perform the great work of redemption and salvation; and who came speedily, and tarried not when the fulness of time was come, as follows. It may design God's word of providence, which answers to his word of power in the first creation of all things; and which orders everything done in the earth, and is instantly obeyed; which agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>.

The object of the action is conceived of in &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; as the medium of it (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a>). The participles in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-8.htm">Psalm 147:8</a>. are attributive clauses that are attached in a free manner to &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; signifies to prepare, procure, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a> - a passage which the psalmist has had in his mind in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>. &#1502;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1495;, as being the causative of a verb. crescendi, is construed with a double accusative: "making mountains (whither human agriculture does not reach) to bring forth grass;" and the advance to the thought that God gives to the cattle the bread that they need is occasioned by the "He causeth grass to grow for the cattle" of the model passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>, just as the only hinting &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, which is said of the young of the raven (which are forsaken and cast off by their mothers very early), is explained from &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; in Job loc. cit.

Towards Him, the gracious Sustainer of all beings, are the ravens croaking for their food pointed (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>, "Consider the ravens"), just like the earth that thirsts for rain. He is the all-conditioning One. Man, who is able to know that which the irrational creature unconsciously acknowledges, is in the feeling of his dependence to trust in Him and not in himself. In all those things to which the God-estranged self-confidence of man so readily clings, God has no delight (&#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509;, pausal form like &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;) and no pleasure, neither in the strength of the horse, whose rider imagines himself invincible, and, if he is obliged to flee, that he cannot be overtaken, nor in the legs of a man, upon which he imagines himself so firm that he cannot be thrown down, and which, when he is pursued, will presumptively carry him far enough away into safety. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1511;, Arab. sa&#770;q, is the leg from the knee to the foot, from Arab. sa&#770;qa, root sq, to drive, urge forward, more particularly to urge on to a gallop (like curs, according to Pott, from the root car, to go). What is meant here is, not that the strength of the horse and muscular power are of no avail when God wills to destroy a man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-14.htm">Amos 2:14</a>.), but only that God has no pleasure in the warrior's horse and in athletic strength. Those who fear Him, i.e., with a knowledge of the impotency of all power possessed by the creature in itself, and in humble trust feel themselves dependent upon His omnipotence - these are they in whom He takes pleasure (&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; with the accusative), those who, renouncing all carnal defiance and self-confident self-working, hope in His mercy. </body></html>
