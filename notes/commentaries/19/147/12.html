The thawing word may represent the gospel of Christ, and the thawing wind the Spirit of Christ; for the Spirit is compared to the wind, Joh 3:8. Converting grace softens the heart that was hard frozen, and melts it into tears of repentance, and makes good reflections to flow, which before were chilled and stopped up. The change which the thaw makes is very evident, yet how it is done no one can say. Such is the change wrought in the conversion of a soul, when God's word and Spirit are sent to melt it and restore it to itself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/147.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem ... - In addition to this general praise in which all may unite, there are special reasons why Jerusalem and its inhabitants should praise God: just as now, in addition to the general reasons pertaining to all people why they should praise God, there are special reasons why Christians - why his redeemed people - should do it. What those reasons, as pertaining to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, were, is specified in the following verses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/147.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11.

Praise ye the Lord.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-12.htm">Psalm 147:12</a><p>"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion." How the poet insists upon praise; he cries praise, praise, as if it were the most important of all duties. A peculiar people should render peculiar praise. The city of peace should be the city of praise; and the temple of the covenant God should resound with his glories. If nowhere else, yet certainly in Zion there should be joyful adoration of Zion's God. Note, that we are to praise the Lord in our own houses in Jerusalem as well as in his own house in Zion. The holy city surrounds the holy hill, and both are dedicated to the holy God, therefore both should ring with hallelujahs.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-13.htm">Psalm 147:13</a><p>"For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates." Her fortifications were finished, even to the fastenings of the gates, and God had made all sound and strong, even to her bolts and bars: thus her security against invading foes was guaranteed. This is no small mercy. Oh, that our churches were thus preserved from all false doctrine and unholy living! This must be the Lord's doing; and where he has wrought it his name is greatly to be praised. Modern libertines would tear down all gates and abolish all bars; but so do not we, because of the fear of the Lord. "He hath blessed thy children within thee." Internal happiness is as truly the Lord's gift as external security. When _he Lord@blesses "thy sos in the midst of thee," thou art, O Zion, filled with a happy, united, zealous, prosperous, holy people, who dwell in communion with God, and enter into the joy of their Lord. When God makes thy walls salvation thy gates must be praise. It would little avail to fortify a wretched, starving city; but when the walls are strengthened, it is a still greater joy to see that the inhabitants are blessed with all good gifts. How much our churches need a present and abiding benediction.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-14.htm">Psalm 147:14</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/147.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/147.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem,....

Instead of &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512; or &#1500;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-2.htm">Psalm 92:2</a>, the expression is &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, a form of the infin. Piel, which at least can still be proved to be possible by &#1500;&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>. The two &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; are co-ordinate, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; no more refers to God here than in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-3.htm">Psalm 135:3</a>, as Hitzig supposes when he alters <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-1.htm">Psalm 147:1</a> so that it reads: "Praise ye Jah because He is good, play unto our God because He is lovely." <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-2.htm">Psalm 92:2</a> shows that &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; can refer to God; but &#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; said of God is contrary to the custom and spirit of the Old Testament, whereas &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; and &#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a> neuter predicates of a subject that is set forth in the infinitive form. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-2.htm">Psalm 147:2</a> the praise begins, and at the same time the confirmation of the delightful duty. Jahve is the builder up of Jerusalem, He brings together (&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505; as in Ezekiel, the later wozd for &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; and &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509;) the outcasts of Israel (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-8.htm">Isaiah 56:8</a>); the building of Jerusalem is therefore intended of the rebuilding up, and to the dispersion of Israel corresponds the holy city laid in ruins. Jahve healeth the heart-broken, as He has shown in the case of the exiles, and bindeth up their pains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>), i.e., smarting wounds; &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;, which is here followed by &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, also takes to itself a dative object in other instances, both in an active and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>) an impersonal application; but for &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489; the older language says &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>. The connection of the thoughts, which the poet now brings to the stars, becomes clear from the primary passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>. To be acquainted with human woe and to relieve it is an easy and small matter to Him who allots a number to the stars, that are to man innumerable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), i.e., who has called them into being by His creative power in whatever number He has pleased, and yet a number known to Him (&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, the part. praes., which occurs frequently in descriptions of the Creator), and calls to them all names, i.e., names them all by names which are the expression of their true nature, which is well known to Him, the Creator. What Isaiah says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>) with the words, "because of the greatness of might, and as being strong in power," and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>) "His understanding is unsearchable," is here asserted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>): great is our Lord, and capable of much (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>, &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;), and to His understanding there is no number, i.e., in its depth and fulness it cannot be defined by any number. What a comfort for the church as it traverses its ways, that are often so labyrinthine and entangled! Its Lord is the Omniscient as well as the Almighty One. Its history, like the universe, is a work of God's infinitely profound and rich understanding. It is a mirror of gracious love and righteous anger. The patient sufferers (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;) He strengthens (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>); malevolent sinners (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;), on the other hand, He casts down to the earth (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a>), casting deep down to the ground those who exalt themselves to the skies. </body></html>
