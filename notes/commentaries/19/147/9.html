It is comely; it becomes us as reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. He gathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holy habitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of his Spirit, he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And for this, let others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; but God's knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while he telleth the number of the stars, he condescends to hear the broken-hearted sinner. While he feeds the young ravens, he will not leave his praying people destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy, yet without them we could have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thus afflictions look black and unpleasant; but from clouds of affliction come showers that make the soul to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. The psalmist delights not in things wherein sinners trust and glory; but a serious and suitable regard to God is, in his sight, of very great price. We are not to be in doubt between hope and fear, but to act under the gracious influences of hope and fear united.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/147.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He giveth to the beast his food - To the wild beast; to the animals that cannot toil for it themselves, as man does.

Through the plenty of grass growing upon the mountains, by the rain falling from the clouds of heaven upon them: these cannot provide for themselves, but the Lord feeds them; and they wait upon him for their food, and receive it of him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27</a>. How much more will he feed his own people, both with temporal and spiritual food; though in their fallen state they are become like the beasts, of which they are sensible when called by grace, and own and acknowledge it! <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>; <p>and to the young ravens which cry: which are particularly mentioned, because contemptible creatures, and of no use and service to men, and by the ceremonial law were impure to the Jews; and the rather, because, as naturalists observe, they are very early turned out of their nests, or forsaken by their dams: and this particular instance of the care of Providence is elsewhere observed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a>. Arama takes notice of the preservation of this creature in the ark, and the use of it to Elijah. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic versions, render it, "that call upon him"; that is, upon God and to him; they are expressly said to cry, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a>.

Tristram, <span class="ital">Nat. Hist, of Bible</span>, p. 200, denies that there is any foundation for the notion that the raven turns its young out of the nest at so early a period that they are unable to provide for themselves. Perhaps the raven’s croak struck the Psalmist especially as an importunate cry.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/147.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He giveth to the beast his food</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-15.htm">Psalm 145:15, 16</a>).

Instead of &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512; or &#1500;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-2.htm">Psalm 92:2</a>, the expression is &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, a form of the infin.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-2.htm">Psalm 147:2</a> the praise begins, and at the same time the confirmation of the delightful duty. Jahve is the builder up of Jerusalem, He brings together (&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505; as in Ezekiel, the later wozd for &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; and &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509;) the outcasts of Israel (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-8.htm">Isaiah 56:8</a>); the building of Jerusalem is therefore intended of the rebuilding up, and to the dispersion of Israel corresponds the holy city laid in ruins. Jahve healeth the heart-broken, as He has shown in the case of the exiles, and bindeth up their pains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>), i.e., smarting wounds; &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;, which is here followed by &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, also takes to itself a dative object in other instances, both in an active and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>) an impersonal application; but for &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489; the older language says &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>. The connection of the thoughts, which the poet now brings to the stars, becomes clear from the primary passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-27.htm">Isaiah 40:27</a>. To be acquainted with human woe and to relieve it is an easy and small matter to Him who allots a number to the stars, that are to man innumerable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), i.e., who has called them into being by His creative power in whatever number He has pleased, and yet a number known to Him (&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, the part. praes., which occurs frequently in descriptions of the Creator), and calls to them all names, i.e., names them all by names which are the expression of their true nature, which is well known to Him, the Creator. What Isaiah says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>) with the words, "because of the greatness of might, and as being strong in power," and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>) "His understanding is unsearchable," is here asserted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>): great is our Lord, and capable of much (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>, &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;), and to His understanding there is no number, i.e., in its depth and fulness it cannot be defined by any number. What a comfort for the church as it traverses its ways, that are often so labyrinthine and entangled! Its Lord is the Omniscient as well as the Almighty One. Its history, like the universe, is a work of God's infinitely profound and rich understanding. It is a mirror of gracious love and righteous anger. The patient sufferers (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;) He strengthens (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>); malevolent sinners (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;), on the other hand, He casts down to the earth (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a>), casting deep down to the ground those who exalt themselves to the skies. </body></html>
