The thawing word may represent the gospel of Christ, and the thawing wind the Spirit of Christ; for the Spirit is compared to the wind, Joh 3:8. Converting grace softens the heart that was hard frozen, and melts it into tears of repentance, and makes good reflections to flow, which before were chilled and stopped up. The change which the thaw makes is very evident, yet how it is done no one can say. Such is the change wrought in the conversion of a soul, when God's word and Spirit are sent to melt it and restore it to itself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/147.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He sendeth out his word - He commands: or, he speaks.<p>And melteth them - Melts the snow and the ice.

The snow, the hoar frost, and ice: this he does by a word of his, who can freeze the earth and waters, and thaw them at his pleasure; by ordering the sun to break forth with great heat, or rain to fall in great plenty; of both which Kimchi interprets his word; as well as by causing a warm wind to blow, as follows, <p>he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters to flow: the south wind particularly; then the waters, which were still and motionless, flow as before, or more abundantly. Thus the hearts of men in a state of nature are like frozen earth or waters; they are cold, and without the heat of love, and affection to God and Christ, and spiritual things; they are as hard as a stone, and without any motion or desire after things divine and heavenly: but when the Lord sends his word, attended with a divine power and efficacy, it breaks and melts them; when the south wind of the blessed Spirit blows upon them, or his grace becomes effectual in convincing them of sin, righteousness, and judgment; and when the sun of righteousness arises on them with healing in his wings; with which being warmed, they are loosened, and flow to the Lord and his goodness for all spiritual blessings. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/147.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/147.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sendeth out his word, and melteth them</span> (comp. ver. 15).

The call goes forth to the church again on the soil of the land of promise assembled round about Jerusalem. The holy city has again risen out of its ruins; it now once more has gates which can stand open in the broad daylight, and can be closed and bolted when the darkness comes on for the security of the municipality that is only just growing into power (<a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1-4</a>). The blessing of God again rests upon the children of the sacred metropolis. Its territory, which has experienced all the sufferings of war, and formerly resounded with the tumult of arms and cries of woe and destruction, God has now, from being an arena of conflict, made into peace (the accusative of the effect, and therefore different from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>); and since the land can now again be cultivated in peace, the ancient promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-17.htm">Psalm 81:17</a>) is fulfilled, that God would feed His people, if they would only obey Him, with the fat of wheat. The God of Israel is the almighty Governor of nature. It is He who sends His fiat (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; after the manner of the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; of the history of creation, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>) earthwards (&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the accusative of the direction). The word is His messenger (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>), &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., it runs as swiftly as possible, viz., in order to execute the errand on which it is sent. He it is who sends down snow-flakes like flocks of wool, so that the fields are covered with snow as with a white-woollen warming covering.<p>(Note: Bochart in his Hierozoicon on this passage compares an observation of Eustathius on Dionysius Periegetes: &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;.)<p>He scatters hoar-frost (&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1512; from &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;, to cover over with the fine frozen dew or mist as though they were powdered with ashes that the wind had blown about. Another time He casts His ice<p>(Note: lxx (Italic, Vulgate) &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., ice, from the root &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;, to freeze, to congeal (Jerome glaciem). Quid est crystallum? asks Augustine, and replies: Nix est glacie durata per multos annos ita ut a sole vel igne acile dissolvi non possit.)<p>(&#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; from &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;; or according to another reading, &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; from &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;) down like morsels, fragments, &#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, viz., as hail-stones, or as sleet. The question: before His cold - who can stand? is formed as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>. It further comes to pass that God sends forth His word and causes them (snow, hoar-frost, and ice) to melt away: He makes His thawing wind blow, waters flow; i.e., as soon as the one comes about, the other also takes place forthwith. This God now, who rules all things by His word and moulds all things according to His will, is the God of the revelation pertaining to the history of salvation, which is come to Israel, and as the bearer of which Israel takes the place of honour among the nations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>., 32-34. Since the poet says &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; and not &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, he is thinking not only of the Tra, but also of prophecy as the continuous self-attestation of God, the Lawgiver. The Ker &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, occasioned by the plurals of the parallel member of the verse, gives an unlimited indistinct idea. We must keep to &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;, with the lxx, Aquila, Theodotion, the Quinta, Sexta, and Jerome. The word, which is the medium of God's cosmical rule, is gone forth as a word of salvation to Israel, and, unfolding itself in statutes and judgments, has raised Israel to a legal state founded upon a positive divine law or judgment such as no Gentile nation possesses. The Hallelujah does not exult over the fact that these other nations are not acquainted with any such positive divine law, but (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>., Baruch 4:4) over the fact that Israel is put into possession of such a law. It is frequently attested elsewhere that this possession of Israel is only meant to be a means of making salvation a common property of the world at large. </body></html>
