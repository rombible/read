When a poor sinner is awakened to a sense of his state, and fears that he must soon sink under the just wrath of God, then he finds trouble and sorrow. But let all such call upon the Lord to deliver their souls, and they will find him gracious and true to his promise. Neither ignorance nor guilt will hinder their salvation, when they put their trust in the Lord. Let us all speak of God as we have found him; and have we ever found him otherwise than just and good? It is of his mercies that we are not consumed. Let those who labour and are heavy laden come to him, that they may find rest to their souls; and if at all drawn from their rest, let them haste to return, remembering how bountifully the Lord has dealt with them. We should deem ourselves bound to walk as in his presence. It is a great mercy to be kept from being swallowed up with over-much sorrow. It is a great mercy for God to hold us by the right hand, so that we are not overcome and overthrown by a temptation. But when we enter the heavenly rest, deliverance from sin and sorrow will be complete; we shall behold the glory of the Lord, and walk in his presence with delight we cannot now conceive.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I love the Lord - The Hebrew rather means, "I love, because the Lord hath heard," etc. That is, the psalmist was conscious of love; he felt it glowing in his soul; his heart was full of that special joy, tenderness, kindness, peace, which love produces; and the source or reason of this, he says, was that the Lord had heard him in his prayers.<p>Because he hath heard ... - That is, This fact was a reason for loving him. The psalmist does not say that this was the only reason, or the main reason for loving him, but that it was the reason for that special joy of love which he then felt in his soul. The main reason for loving God is his own excellency of nature; but still there are other reasons for doing it, and among them are the benefits which he has conferred on us, and which awaken the love of gratitude.

A truly grateful love will be evinced by acts of worship, which calling on God expresses (Ps 116:13; Ps 55:16; 86:7; compare Ps 17:6; 31:2).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/116.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.<p>2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as Ilive.<p>3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.<p>4 Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<p>5 Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.<p>6 The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.<p>7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.<p>8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-1.htm">Psalm 116:1</a><p>"I love the Lord." A blessed declaration: every believer ought to be able to declare without the slightest hesitation, "I love the Lord." It was required under the law, but was never produced in the heart of man except by the grace of God, and upon gospel principles. It is a great thing to say "I love the Lord" : for the sweetest of all graces and the surest of all evidences of salvation is love. It is great goodness on the part of God that he condescends to be loved by such poor creatures as we are, and it is a sure proof that he has been at work in our heart when we can say, "Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee." "Because he hath heard my voice and my supplications." The Psalmist not only knows that he loves God, but he knows why he does so. When love can justify itself with a reason, it is deep, strong, and abiding. They say that love is blind; but when we love God our affection has its eyes open and can sustain itself with the most rigid logic. We have reason, superabundant reason, for loving the Lord; and so because in this case principle and passion, reason and emotion go together, they make up an admirable state of mind. David's reason for his love was the love of God in hearing his prayers. The Psalmist had used his "voice" in prayer, and the habit of doing so is exceedingly helpful to devotion. If we can pray aloud without being overheard it is well to do so. Sometimes, however, when the Psalmist had lifted up his voice, his utterance had been so broken and painful that he scarcely dared to call it prayer; words failed him, he could only produce a groaning sound, but the Lord heard his moaning voice. At other times his prayers were more regular and better formed' these he calls "supplications." David had praised as best he could, and when one form of devotion failed him he tried another. He had gone to the Lord again and again, hence he uses the plural and says "my supplications," but as often as he had gone, so often had he been welcome. Jehovah had heard, that is to say, accepted, and answered both his broken cries and his more composed and orderly supplications; hence he loved God with all his heart. Answered prayers are silken bonds which bind our hearts to God. When a man's prayers are answered, love is the natural result. According to Alexander, both verbs may be translated in the present, and the text may run thus, "I love because Jehovah hears my voice, my supplications." This also is true in the case of every pleading believer. Continual love flows out of daily answers to prayer.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-2.htm">Psalm 116:2</a><p>"Because he hath inclined his ear unto me" : - bowing down from his grandeur to attend to my prayer; the figure seems to be that of a tender physician or loving friend leaning over a sick man whose voice is faint and scarcely audible, so as to catch every accent and whisper. When our prayer is very feeble, so that we ourselves can scarcely hear it, and question whether we do pray or not, yet God bows a listening ear, and regards our supplications. "Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live," or, "in my days." Throughout all the days of my life I will address my prayer to God alone, and to him I will unceasingly pray. It is always wise to go where we are welcome and are well treated. The word "call" may imply praise as well as prayer: calling upon the name of the Lord is an expressive name for adoration of all kinds. When prayer is heard in our feebleness, and answered in the strength and greatness of God, we are strengthened in the habit of prayer, and confirmed in the resolve to make ceaseless intercession. We should not thank a beggar who informed us that because we had granted his request he would never cease to beg of us, and yet doubtless it is acceptable to God that his petitioners should form the resolution to continue in prayer: this shows the greatness of his goodness, and the abundance of his patience. In all days let us pray and praise the Ancient of days. He promises that as our days our strength shall be; let us resolve that as our days our devotion shall be.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-3.htm">Psalm 116:3</a><p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm contains a solemn thanksgiving to God for a glorious deliverance from grievous and dangerous calamities; as also from great perplexities and terrors of mind arising from the sense of God’s displeasure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The psalmist professeth his love to God for his manifold mercies in delivering him out of great straits and dangers, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm" title="For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.">Psalm 116:8</a></span>; promising to walk holily, prayeth for his future protection, studieth and promiseth to be thanked, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/116-9.htm" title="I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living....">Psalm 116:9-19</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/116.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I love the Lord,.... As the Messiah, David's antitype, did; of which he gave the fullest proof by his obedience to his will; and as David, the man after God's own heart, did, and as every good man does; and the Lord is to be loved for the perfections of his nature, and especially as they are displayed in Christ, and salvation by him; and for his works of creation, providence, and grace, and particularly for his great love shown in redemption, regeneration, and other blessings of grace, as well as for what follows. <p>Because he hath heard my voice and my supplication; in the original text the words lie thus, "I love, because the Lord hath heard", or "will hear"; and so read the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, Syriac, and Arabic versions, and so the Targum; and may be rendered, "I love that the Lord should hear me", so the Syriac and Arabic versions; nothing is more desirable and grateful to good men than that the Lord should hear them; but Kimchi and others transpose the words as we do, which gives a reason why he loved the Lord; because he heard his prayers, which were vocal, put up in a time of distress, in an humble and submissive manner, under the influence of the Spirit of grace and supplication, in the name of Christ, for his righteousness sake, and through his mediation; and such supplications are heard and answered by the Lord, sooner or later; and which engages the love of his people to him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>.

The threefold division into Israel, the house of Aaron, and those who fear Jahve is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-2.htm">Psalm 118:2-4</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a> the "house of Levi" is further added to the house of Aaron. Those who fear Jahve, who also stand in the last passage, are probably the proselytes (in the Acts of the Apostles &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, or merely &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>(Note: The appellation &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; does not however occur, if we do not bring <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a> in here; but in Latin inscriptions in Orelli-Hentzen No. 2523, and in Auer in the Zeitschrift fr katholische Theologie 1852, S. 80, the proselyte (religionis Judaicae) is called metuens.))<p>at any rate these are included even if Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9</a> is meant to signify the laity, for the notion of "those who fear Jahve" extends beyond Israel. The fact that the threefold refrain of the summons does not run, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>, our help and shield is He, is to be explained from its being an antiphonal song. In so far, however, as the Psalm supplicates God's protection and help in a campaign the declaration of confident hope, their help and shield is He, may, with Hitzig, be referred to the army that is gone or is going forth. It is the same voice which bids Israel to be of good courage and announces to the people the well-pleased acceptance of the sacrifice with the words "Jahve hath been mindful of us" (&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;, cf. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), perhaps simultaneously with the presentation of the memorial portion (&#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;) of the meat-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-1.htm">Psalm 38:1</a>). The &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; placed at the head is particularized threefold, corresponding to the threefold summons. The special promise of blessing which is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-14.htm">Psalm 115:14</a> is an echo of <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-3.htm">2 Samuel 24:3</a>. The contracted future &#1497;&#1505;&#1507; we take in a consolatory sense; for as an optative it would be too isolated here. In spite of all oppression on the part of the heathen, God will make His people ever more numerous, more capable of offering resistance, and more awe-inspiring. </body></html>
