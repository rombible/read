The literal rendering of the text, given by the LXX. and Vulg., is, “and in my days I will call (for help). But there is none.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-19.htm" title="Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?">2Kings 20:19</a> does not, as suggested, confirm the explanation “all the days of my life.” It would seem more natural to take the text as an equivalent of the common phrase “in the day when I call” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-10.htm" title="In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.">Psalm 56:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-3.htm" title="For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.">Psalm 102:3</a>, &c), and render the verse:<p>For He inclines His ear to me,<p>And that in the day when I call.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/116.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>116:1-9 We have many reasons for loving the Lord, but are most affected by his loving-kindness when relieved out of deep distress. When a poor sinner is awakened to a sense of his state, and fears that he must soon sink under the just wrath of God, then he finds trouble and sorrow. But let all such call upon the Lord to deliver their souls, and they will find him gracious and true to his promise. Neither ignorance nor guilt will hinder their salvation, when they put their trust in the Lord. Let us all speak of God as we have found him; and have we ever found him otherwise than just and good? It is of his mercies that we are not consumed. Let those who labour and are heavy laden come to him, that they may find rest to their souls; and if at all drawn from their rest, let them haste to return, remembering how bountifully the Lord has dealt with them. We should deem ourselves bound to walk as in his presence. It is a great mercy to be kept from being swallowed up with over-much sorrow. It is a great mercy for God to hold us by the right hand, so that we are not overcome and overthrown by a temptation. But when we enter the heavenly rest, deliverance from sin and sorrow will be complete; we shall behold the glory of the Lord, and walk in his presence with delight we cannot now conceive.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because he hath inclined his ear unto me - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-1.htm">Psalm 5:1</a>. Because he has been gracious to me, and has heard my prayers. This is a pood reason for serving God, or for devoting ourselves to him, but it is not the only reason. We ought to worship and serve God whether he hears our prayers or not; whether he sends joy or sorrow; whether we are favored with prosperity, or are sunk in deep affliction. People have worshipped God even when they have had no evidence that he heard their prayers; and some of the most pure acts of devotion on earth are those which come from the very depths of darkness and sorrow.<p>Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live - Margin, as in Hebrew, "in my days." Encouraged by the past, I will continue to call upon him in the future. I will retain a firm faith in the doctrine that he hears prayer, and I will express my practical belief in the truth of that doctrine by regular and constant habits of worship. When a man once has evidence that God has heard his prayer, it is a reason why he should always call on him in similar circumstances, for God does not change. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/116.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 116<p>Ps 116:1-19.

Not as hard of hearing, for his ear is not heavy that it cannot hear; he is quick of hearing, and his ears are always open to the righteous; it rather denotes his readiness to hear; he hearkens and hears, he listens to what his people say, and hears them at once, and understands them, though ever so broken and confused; when their prayers are but like the chatterings of a crane or swallow, or only expressed in sighs and groans, and even without a voice; when nothing is articulately pronounced: moreover, this shows condescension in him; he bows his ear as a rattler to a child, he stoops as being above them, and inclines his ear to them. <p>Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live; or "in my days" (d); in days of adversity and affliction, for help and relief; in days of prosperity, with thankfulness for favours received; every day I live, and several times a day: prayer should be constantly used; men should pray without ceasing always, and not faint; prayer is the first and last action of a spiritual life; it is the first thing a regenerate man does, "behold, he prays"; as soon as he is born again he prays, and continues praying all his days; and generally goes out of the world praying, as Stephen did, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit"; and it is the Lord's hearing prayer that encourages his people to keep on praying, and which makes the work delightful to them.

The threefold division into Israel, the house of Aaron, and those who fear Jahve is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-2.htm">Psalm 118:2-4</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a> the "house of Levi" is further added to the house of Aaron. Those who fear Jahve, who also stand in the last passage, are probably the proselytes (in the Acts of the Apostles &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, or merely &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>(Note: The appellation &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; does not however occur, if we do not bring <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a> in here; but in Latin inscriptions in Orelli-Hentzen No. 2523, and in Auer in the Zeitschrift fr katholische Theologie 1852, S. 80, the proselyte (religionis Judaicae) is called metuens.))<p>at any rate these are included even if Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9</a> is meant to signify the laity, for the notion of "those who fear Jahve" extends beyond Israel. The fact that the threefold refrain of the summons does not run, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>, our help and shield is He, is to be explained from its being an antiphonal song. In so far, however, as the Psalm supplicates God's protection and help in a campaign the declaration of confident hope, their help and shield is He, may, with Hitzig, be referred to the army that is gone or is going forth. It is the same voice which bids Israel to be of good courage and announces to the people the well-pleased acceptance of the sacrifice with the words "Jahve hath been mindful of us" (&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;, cf. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), perhaps simultaneously with the presentation of the memorial portion (&#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;) of the meat-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-1.htm">Psalm 38:1</a>). The &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; placed at the head is particularized threefold, corresponding to the threefold summons. The special promise of blessing which is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-14.htm">Psalm 115:14</a> is an echo of <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-3.htm">2 Samuel 24:3</a>. The contracted future &#1497;&#1505;&#1507; we take in a consolatory sense; for as an optative it would be too isolated here. In spite of all oppression on the part of the heathen, God will make His people ever more numerous, more capable of offering resistance, and more awe-inspiring. </body></html>
