Mr. Burgess has certainly given the true explanation of the use of this particle. It sometimes <span class= "ital">follows</span> instead of <span class= "ital">preceding </span>the verb affected by it. We must render, <span class= "ital">It is because I believed that I spoke </span>(of God’s graciousness, &c.). What follows then comes in as an antithesis. <span class= "ital">I was in great trouble; I said in my pain, “All men are untrustworthy </span>or <span class= "ital">deceitful” </span>Or (LXX.), <span class= "ital">In an ecstasy of despair I said</span>, “<span class= "ital">The whole race of mankind is a delusion</span>.” The meaning of the whole passage may be thus put: It is through trust in God that I thus speak (as above—viz., of God being glorious and righteous, and of His preserving the souls of the simple). It was not always so. Once in distrust I thought that God did not care for man, and that the whole of humanity was a failure. The word <span class= "ital">chāphez, </span>rendered in Authorised Version <span class= "ital">haste, </span>more properly <span class= "ital">alarm, </span>is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-23.htm" title="Behold, he drinks up a river, and hastens not: he trusts that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.">Job 40:23</a> contrasted with <span class= "ital">trust, </span>as it is here with <span class= "ital">faith. </span>For the sense <span class= "ital">failure </span>or <span class= "ital">vanity </span>for the word rendered in Authorised Version <span class= "ital">liars, </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-11.htm" title="And the LORD shall guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in drought, and make fat your bones: and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.">Isaiah 58:11</a> (“fail;” margin, “lie or deceive”).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/116.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-10.htm" title="I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:">Psalm 116:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have believed — </span>God’s promise of deliverance; <span class="ital">therefore have I spoken — </span>What I have now said; or, I have firmly believed, and trusted in God’s almighty power, and ever watchful providence, and therefore have addressed my prayer unto him with confidence in my greatest dangers and distresses.

Yet there may be true faith where there are workings of unbelief; but then faith will prevail; and being humbled for our distrust of God's word, we shall experience his faithfulness to it. What can the pardoned sinner, or what can those who have been delivered from trouble or distress, render to the Lord for his benefits? We cannot in any way profit him. Our best is unworthy of his acceptance; yet we ought to devote ourselves and all we have to his service. I will take the cup of salvation; I will offer the drink-offerings appointed by the law, in token of thankfulness to God, and rejoice in God's goodness to me. I will receive the cup of affliction; that cup, that bitter cup, which is sanctified to the saints, so that to them it is a cup of salvation; it is a means of spiritual health. The cup of consolation; I will receive the benefits God bestows upon me, as from his hand, and taste his love in them, as the portion not only of mine inheritance in the other world, but of my cup in this. Let others serve what masters they will, truly I am thy servant. Two ways men came to be servants. By birth. Lord, I was born in thy house; I am the son of thine handmaid, and therefore thine. It is a great mercy to be children of godly parents. By redemption. Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds, thou hast discharged me from them, therefore I am thy servant. The bonds thou hast loosed shall tie me faster unto thee. Doing good is sacrifice, with which God is well pleased; and this must accompany giving thanks to his name. Why should we offer that to the Lord which cost us nothing? The psalmist will pay his vows now; he will not delay the payment: publicly, not to make a boast, but to show he is not ashamed of God's service, and to invite others to join him. Such are true saints of God, in whose lives and deaths he will be glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I believed, therefore have I spoken - This, in the Septuagint and Latin Vulgate, begins a new psalm, but without any good reason. This language is borrowed by the Apostle Paul to express his confidence in the truth of the gospel, and the effect which that confidence had on him in causing him to declare the truth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>. The meaning here is, that in the time of his affliction the psalmist had true faith in God; and, as a result of that, he was able now to speak as he did. At that time he trusted in God; he called on him; he sought his mercy, and God heard his prayer; and now, as the consequence of that, he was enabled to give utterance to these thoughts. Faith was at the foundation of his recovery, and he was now reaping the fruits of faith.<p>I was greatly afflicted - In danger of death. The psalmist reviewed this now, and he saw that all that he had felt and dreaded was real. He was in imminent; danger. There was occasion for the tears which he shed. There was reason for the earnestness of his cry to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/116.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11.

Here the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, begin a new psalm, but without any foundation in the original; nor is it countenanced by the Targum; and is manifestly against the connection with the preceding verses. David expresses his faith in relation to what goes before, though the particulars of it are not mentioned, but are left to be supplied from thence: he not only believed there was a God, but that this God was gracious and merciful, and that he was his God; who had made a covenant with him, ordered in all things, and sure: he believed the promises of it; and particularly the grand promise of it respecting Christ, and salvation by him: he believed the Lord would deliver him out of all his troubles; that he should walk before him, and see his goodness in the land of the living; he believed a future state of happiness he should hereafter enjoy. The Apostle Paul quotes this passage, and applies it to himself and other Gospel ministers; declaring their faith in the resurrection of the dead, and an eternal weight of glory they were looking for, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>; and therefore spake so freely about these things. Faith gives boldness and freedom of speech to men; which believers use with God in prayer, in the believing views of him, as their God in Christ; and of Christ, his person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice: it gives ministers boldness and freedom to speak out plainly, constantly, and boldly, the Gospel of Christ; it gives the same to private Christians, to speak freely one to another of their gracious experiences, and to declare publicly to the churches of Christ what God has done for their souls; <p>I was greatly afflicted; when he believed and spake, and yet nevertheless did; he might be afflicted, reproached, and persecuted for his faith, and his speaking of it; particularly as it respected his coming to the crown and kingdom of Israel. And it is no unusual thing for saints to be persecuted for their faith, and profession of it; and yet none of these things move them from it; their faith remains, and is much more precious than gold that perisheth; and they hold fast the profession of it. Many and great afflictions are the common lot of believers. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/116.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{f}</span> I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:</span><p>(f) I felt all these things, and therefore was moved by faith to confess them, 2Co 4:13.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/116.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10, 11</span>. In the extremity of his distress the Psalmist was compelled to recognise the delusiveness of human help, but he never lost faith in God. Such is the general sense, but the details of interpretation are doubtful. The A.V. <span class="ital">I believed, therefore have I spoken</span> follows the LXX (<span class="greekheb">ἐπίστευσα</span>, <span class="greekheb">διὸ ἐλάλησα</span>), which is quoted by St Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm" title="We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>; but this rendering must be abandoned as grammatically untenable. On the whole it seems best to render:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I believed [or as R.V. I believe], for I will speak:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I was exceedingly afflicted:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I said In my alarm,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All men are deceitful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I believed may be understood absolutely, ‘I held fast to my faith in Jehovah’: but the Psalmist evidently (cp. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-9.htm" title="I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.">Psalm 116:9</a></span>) still has in mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm" title="I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.">Psalm 27:13</a> “I believe that I shall see the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living,” and the use of the word there suggests that the sense here should be completed from <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-9.htm" title="I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.">Psalm 116:9</a></span>, “I believed that it would be so,” viz. ‘that I should walk before Jehovah in the lands of the living.’ This faith he retained though he was grievously afflicted.

The poet is fond of this pregnant use of the verb without an expressed object, cf. &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/116-2.htm">Psalm 116:2</a>, and &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a>. The Pasek after &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is intended to guard against the blending of the final a&#8219; with the initial 'a of &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a> :18; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>, in Baer). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-1.htm">Psalm 116:1</a> the accentuation prevents the rendering vocem orationis meae (Vulgate, lxx) by means of Mugrash. The &#305;&#770; of &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497; will therefore no more be the archaic connecting vowel (Ew. 211, b) than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42</a>; the poet has varied the genitival construction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-6.htm">Psalm 28:6</a> to the permutative. The second &#1499;&#1497;, following close upon the first, makes the continuation of the confirmation retrospective. "In my days" is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/39-8.htm">Isaiah 39:8</a>, Bar. 4:20, cf. &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>, and frequently, equivalent to "so long as I live." We even here hear the tone of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>), which is continued in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3-4</a> as a freely borrowed passage. Instead of the "bands" (of Hades) there, the expression here is &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, angustiae, plural of meetsar, after the form &#1502;&#1505;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-3.htm">Lamentations 1:3</a> (Bttcher, De inferis, 423); the straitnesses of Hades are deadly perils which can scarcely be escaped. The futures &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; and &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, by virtue of the connection, refer to the contemporaneous past. &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (viz., &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, i.e., in a suppliant sense) is written with He instead of Aleph here and in five other instances, as the Masora observes.

But the Palestinian and the Babylonian systems of pointing coincide in this, that the beseeching &#1488;&#1504;&#1488; (&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;) is Milra, and the interrogatory &#1488;&#1504;&#1492; Milel (with only two exceptions in our text, which is fixed according to the Palestinian Masora, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>, where the following word begins with Aleph), and these modes of accenting accord with the origin of the two particles. Pinsker (Einleitung, S. xiii.) insinuates against the Palestinian system, that in the cases where &#1488;&#1504;&#1488; has two accents the pointing was not certain of the correct accentuation, only from a deficient knowledge of the bearings of the case.)<p>Instead now of repeating "and Jahve answered me," the poet indulges in a laudatory confession of general truths which have been brought vividly to his mind by the answering of his prayer that he has experienced. </body></html>
