Others, again, take the figurative sense of cup—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>portion, lot, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/116.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>116:10-19 When troubled, we do best to hold our peace, for we are apt to speak unadvisedly. Yet there may be true faith where there are workings of unbelief; but then faith will prevail; and being humbled for our distrust of God's word, we shall experience his faithfulness to it. What can the pardoned sinner, or what can those who have been delivered from trouble or distress, render to the Lord for his benefits? We cannot in any way profit him. Our best is unworthy of his acceptance; yet we ought to devote ourselves and all we have to his service. I will take the cup of salvation; I will offer the drink-offerings appointed by the law, in token of thankfulness to God, and rejoice in God's goodness to me. I will receive the cup of affliction; that cup, that bitter cup, which is sanctified to the saints, so that to them it is a cup of salvation; it is a means of spiritual health. The cup of consolation; I will receive the benefits God bestows upon me, as from his hand, and taste his love in them, as the portion not only of mine inheritance in the other world, but of my cup in this. Let others serve what masters they will, truly I am thy servant. Two ways men came to be servants. By birth. Lord, I was born in thy house; I am the son of thine handmaid, and therefore thine. It is a great mercy to be children of godly parents. By redemption. Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds, thou hast discharged me from them, therefore I am thy servant. The bonds thou hast loosed shall tie me faster unto thee. Doing good is sacrifice, with which God is well pleased; and this must accompany giving thanks to his name. Why should we offer that to the Lord which cost us nothing? The psalmist will pay his vows now; he will not delay the payment: publicly, not to make a boast, but to show he is not ashamed of God's service, and to invite others to join him. Such are true saints of God, in whose lives and deaths he will be glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will take the cup of salvation - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>. The "cup of salvation" means the cup by which his sense of the greatness of the salvation might be expressed - the cup of thanksgiving. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>. The reference seems to be to a custom in festivals of drinking a cup of wine as a special expression of thanks or of obligation. The act would be more solemn, and the truth more deeply impressed on the mind, when accompanied by some religious rite - some ceremonial, as in the Lord's Supper, expressly designed to call the mercy of God to remembrance.<p>And call upon the name of the Lord - Engage in a solemn act of devotion; make it a matter of special ceremony or observance to call the mercy of God to remembrance. This was one way of rendering to the Lord a return for the benefits received at his hands; as it is now. Christians do this at the table of the Lord - in the observance of the Lord's Supper. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/116.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the cup of salvation&#8212;the drink offering which was part of the thank offering (Nu 15:3-5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/116.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will take the cup of salvation; </span> I will offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving to God, as this phrase seems to be explained below, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-17.htm" title="I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the LORD.">Psalm 116:17</a></span>, where the latter clause of the verse is the same with that which here follows. The phrase is taken from the common practice of the Jews in their thank-offerings, in which a feast was made of the remainders of the sacrifices, and the offerers, together with the priests, did eat and drink before the Lord, and, amongst other rites, the master of the feast took a cup of wine into his hand, and solemnly blessed God for it, and for the mercy which was then acknowledged, and then gave it to all the guests, who drunk successively of it; see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-2.htm" title="And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.">1 Chronicles 16:2</a>,3</span>; to which custom it is supposed that our blessed Saviour alludes in the institution of the cup, which also is called <span class="ital">the cup of blessing</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?

This metaphor of a <span class="ital">cup</span> is used both of afflictions, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm" title="On the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.">Psalm 11:6</a> 75:8</span>, and of comforts, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm" title="Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.">Jeremiah 16:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Call upon the name of the Lord; </span> or, publish or preach in or of the name of the Lord, i.e. his gracious nature, and the great things which he hath done for me.

It has been usual to explain this of actual participation in the contents of a cup offered at a sacrificial meal, and then passed round to the worshippers. But there is no clear evidence of any such usage, except in connection with the Passover, which cannot here be in question. Hengstenberg there fore proposes to regard the phrase as a mere metaphor, like the "cup of trembling" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 22</a>), and understands the psalmist to mean that he will gladly and thankfully receive God's mercy vouchsafed to him, and thus show his gratitude for it. <span class="cmt_word">And call upon the Name of the Lord</span> (comp. vers. 4 and 17). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/116.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With "gracious" and "compassionate" is here associated, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>, the term "righteous," which comprehends within itself everything that Jahve asserts concerning Himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. from the words "and abundant in goodness and truth" onwards. His love is turned especially toward the simple (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>), who stand in need of His protection and give themselves over to it. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>, is a mode of writing blended out of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;. The poet also has experienced this love in a time of impotent need. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is accented on the ultima here, and not as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-7.htm">Psalm 142:7</a> on the penult. The accentuation is regulated by some phonetic or rhythmical law that has not yet been made clear (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>).<p>(Note: The national grammarians, so far as we are acquainted with them, furnish no explanation. De Balmis believes that these Milra forms &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, and the like, must be regarded as infinitives, but at the same time confirms the difference of views existing on this point.)<p>&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; is a resolved Hiphil form, the use of which became common in the later period of the language, but is not alien to the earlier period, especially in poetry (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-7.htm">Psalm 116:7</a> we hear the form of soliloquy which has become familiar to us from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497; is Milra here, as also in two other instances. The plural &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; signifies full, complete rest, as it is found only in God; and the suffix in the address to the soul is ajchi for ajich, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3-5</a>. The perfect &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; states that which is a matter of actual experience, and is corroborated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8</a> in retrospective perfects. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8-9</a> we hear <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-14.htm">Psalm 56:14</a> again amplified; and if we add <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, then we see as it were to the bottom of the origin of the poet's thoughts. &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492; belongs still more decidedly than &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; to the resolved forms which multiply in the later period of the language. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a> the poet declares the result of the divine deliverance. The Hithpa. &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; denotes a free and contented going to and fro; and instead of "the land of the living," <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, the expression here is "the lands (&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;), i.e., the broad land, of the living." There he walks forth, with nothing to hinder his feet or limit his view, in the presence of Jahve, i.e., having his Deliverer from death ever before his eyes. </body></html>
