When a poor sinner is awakened to a sense of his state, and fears that he must soon sink under the just wrath of God, then he finds trouble and sorrow. But let all such call upon the Lord to deliver their souls, and they will find him gracious and true to his promise. Neither ignorance nor guilt will hinder their salvation, when they put their trust in the Lord. Let us all speak of God as we have found him; and have we ever found him otherwise than just and good? It is of his mercies that we are not consumed. Let those who labour and are heavy laden come to him, that they may find rest to their souls; and if at all drawn from their rest, let them haste to return, remembering how bountifully the Lord has dealt with them. We should deem ourselves bound to walk as in his presence. It is a great mercy to be kept from being swallowed up with over-much sorrow. It is a great mercy for God to hold us by the right hand, so that we are not overcome and overthrown by a temptation. But when we enter the heavenly rest, deliverance from sin and sorrow will be complete; we shall behold the glory of the Lord, and walk in his presence with delight we cannot now conceive.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord preserveth the simple - The Septuagint renders this "babes" - &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  ne&#772;pia. The Hebrew word has reference to simplicity or folly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>. It then refers to those who are the opposite of cautious or cunning; to those who are open to persuasion; to those who are easily enticed or seduced. The verb from which the word is derived - &#1508;&#1514;&#1492;  pa&#770;tha&#770;h - means to open, to expand; then, to be open, frank, ingenuous, easily persuaded or enticed. Thus it may express either the idea of being simple in the sense of being foolish, easily seduced and led astray; or, simple in the sense of being open, frank, ingenuous, trustful, sincere. The latter is evidently its meaning here. It refers to one of the characteristics of true piety - that of unsuspecting trust in God. It would describe one who yields readily to truth and duty; one who has singleness of aim in the desire to honor God; one who is without guile, trick, or cunning. Such a man was Nathanael <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a> : "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile." The Hebrew word used here is rendered simple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-130.htm">Psalm 119:130</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-18.htm">Proverbs 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-11.htm">Proverbs 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-20.htm">Ezekiel 45:20</a>; and foolish, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>. It does not elsewhere occur. The meaning here is, that the Lord preserves or keeps those who have simple and unwavering trust in him; those who are sincere in their professions; those who rely on his word.<p>I was brought low - By affliction and trial. The Hebrew literally means to hang down, to be pendulous, to swing, to wave - as a bucket in a well, or as the slender branches of the palm, the willow, etc. Then it means to be slack, feeble, weak, as in sickness, etc. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>. Here it probably refers to the prostration of strength by disease.<p>And he helped me - He gave me strength; he restored me. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/116.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-8. The relief which he asked is the result not of his merit, but of God's known pity and tenderness, which is acknowledged in assuring himself (his "soul," Ps 11:1; 16:10) of rest and peace.

Such as have but a small degree of understanding, either in things natural or spiritual, in comparison of others; babes, as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render it, so in the Talmud (i); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>. Such who are sensible of their lack of wisdom, and what they have they do not lean unto or trust in, but being sensible of their weakness commit themselves to the Lord; they are sincere and upright, harmless and inoffensive, artless and incautious, and so easily imposed upon by designing men; but the Lord preserves them, as from sin, from a total and final falling away by it, so from gross errors and heresies; he preserves them from the snares and pollutions of the world, and from the temptations of Satan, so as not to be overcome with them; he preserves them by his Spirit, power, and grace, safe to his kingdom and glory. <p>I was brought low and he helped me; the psalmist returns to his own case, and gives an instance of the divine goodness in himself; he had been brought low by affliction of body, by distress of enemies, through want of the necessaries and conveniences of life; he had been brought low as to spiritual things, through the weakness of grace, the prevalence of corruption, the temptations of Satan, and the hidings of God's face; but the Lord helped him to bear up under all this; he put underneath his everlasting arms, and upheld him with the right hand of his righteousness; he helped him out of his low estate, and delivered him out of all his troubles, when none else could; when things were at the greatest extremity, and he in the utmost distress, just ready to go down into silence and dwell there, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm">Psalm 94:17</a>.

Jahve is here called the Creator of heaven and earth because the worth and magnitude of His blessing are measured thereby. He has reserved the heavens to Himself, but given the earth to men. This separation of heaven and earth is a fundamental characteristic of the post-diluvian history. The throne of God is in the heavens, and the promise, which is given to the patriarchs on behalf of all mankind, does not refer to heaven, but to the possession of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-22.htm">Psalm 37:22</a>). The promise is as yet limited to this present world, whereas in the New Testament this limitation is removed and the &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; embraces heaven and earth. This Old Testament limitedness finds further expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>, where &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm">Psalm 94:17</a>, signifies the silent land of Hades. The Old Testament knows nothing of a heavenly ecclesia that praises God without intermission, consisting not merely of angels, but also of the spirits of all men who die in the faith. Nevertheless there are not wanting hints that point upwards which were even better understood by the post-exilic than by the pre-exilic church. The New Testament morn began to dawn even upon the post-exilic church. We must not therefore be astonished to find the tone of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11-13</a>, struck up here, although the echo of those earlier Psalms here is only the dark foil of the confession which the church makes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-18.htm">Psalm 115:18</a> concerning its immortality. The church of Jahve as such does not die. That it also does not remain among the dead, in whatever degree it may die off in its existing members, the psalmist might know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>. But the close of the Psalm shows that such predictions which light up the life beyond only gradually became elements of the church's consciousness, and, so to speak, dogmas. </body></html>
