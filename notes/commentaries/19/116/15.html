But again we have to ask why the thought of death should intrude upon the psalmist at this moment. (See Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm" title="The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.">Psalm 115:17</a>.) The answer is that, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm" title="For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.">Psalm 116:8</a>, a recent deliverance from death is spoken of. It is natural to take this psalm as a thanksgiving song for the safety, perhaps victory, of the survivors in some battle, but then the grateful community naturally and dutifully remember the dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/116.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-15.htm" title="Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.">Psalm 116:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Precious, &c., is the death of his saints </span>— He sets a high price upon it: he will not easily grant it to the will of their enemies. If any son of violence procure it, he will make him pay very dearly for it.

Yet there may be true faith where there are workings of unbelief; but then faith will prevail; and being humbled for our distrust of God's word, we shall experience his faithfulness to it. What can the pardoned sinner, or what can those who have been delivered from trouble or distress, render to the Lord for his benefits? We cannot in any way profit him. Our best is unworthy of his acceptance; yet we ought to devote ourselves and all we have to his service. I will take the cup of salvation; I will offer the drink-offerings appointed by the law, in token of thankfulness to God, and rejoice in God's goodness to me. I will receive the cup of affliction; that cup, that bitter cup, which is sanctified to the saints, so that to them it is a cup of salvation; it is a means of spiritual health. The cup of consolation; I will receive the benefits God bestows upon me, as from his hand, and taste his love in them, as the portion not only of mine inheritance in the other world, but of my cup in this. Let others serve what masters they will, truly I am thy servant. Two ways men came to be servants. By birth. Lord, I was born in thy house; I am the son of thine handmaid, and therefore thine. It is a great mercy to be children of godly parents. By redemption. Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds, thou hast discharged me from them, therefore I am thy servant. The bonds thou hast loosed shall tie me faster unto thee. Doing good is sacrifice, with which God is well pleased; and this must accompany giving thanks to his name. Why should we offer that to the Lord which cost us nothing? The psalmist will pay his vows now; he will not delay the payment: publicly, not to make a boast, but to show he is not ashamed of God's service, and to invite others to join him. Such are true saints of God, in whose lives and deaths he will be glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/116.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints - Of his people; his friends. Luther renders this, "The death of his saints is held to be of value" - (ist werth gehalten) - "before the Lord." The word rendered "precious" - &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;  ya&#770;qa&#770;r - means costly, as precious stones, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10-11</a>; dear, beloved, as relatives and friends, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>; honored, respected, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:1</a>; splendid, beautiful, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; rare, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>. The idea here is, that the death of saints is an object of value; that God regards it as of importance; that it is connected with his great plans, and that there are great purposes to be accomplished by it. The idea here seems to be that the death of a good man is in itself of so much importance, and so connected with the glory of God and the accomplishment of his purposes, that he will not cause it to take place except in circumstances, at times, and in a manner, which will best secure those ends. The particular thought in the mind of the psalmist seems to have been that as he had been preserved when he was apparently so near to death, it must have been because God saw that the death of one of his friends was a matter of so much importance that it should occur only when the most good could be effected by it, and when the ends of life had been accomplished; that God would not decide on this hastily, or without the best reasons; and that, therefore, he had interposed to lengthen out his life still longer. Still, there is a general truth implied here, to wit, that the act of removing a good man from the world is, so to speak, an act of deep deliberation on the part of God; that good, and sometimes great, ends are to be accomplished by it; and that, therefore, God regards it with special interest. It is of value or importance in such respects as the following:<p>(1) as it is the removal of another of the redeemed to glory - the addition of one more to the happy hosts above;<p>(2) as it is a new triumph of the work of redemption - showing the power and the value of that work;<p>(3) as it often furnishes a more direct proof of the reality of religion than any abstract argument could do.<p>How much has the cause of religion been promoted by the patient deaths of Ignatius, and Polycarp, and Latimer, and Ridley, and Huss, and Jerome of Prague, and the hosts of the martyrs! What does not the world owe, and the cause of religion owe, to such scenes as occurred on the death-beds of Baxter, and Thomas Scott, and Halyburton, and Payson! What an argument for the truth of religion - what an illustration of its sustaining power - what a source of comfort to us who are soon to die - to reflect that religion does not leave the believer when he most needs its support and consolations; that it can sustain us in the severest trial of our condition here; that it can illuminate what seems to us of all places most dark, cheerless, dismal, repulsive - "the valley of the shadow of death!" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/116.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15, 16.

The Lord has his saints or sanctified ones, who are sanctified or set apart by God the Father from all eternity; who are sanctified in Christ, their head and representative; who are sanctified by his blood, shed for the expiation of their sins; who are sanctified by his Spirit and grace, are called with an holy calling, and have principles of holiness wrought in them, and live holy lives and conversations. The word (o) used also signifies one that has received kindness and favour, and shows it: saints are such, who have received spiritual blessings from the Lord; to whom he has been kind and bountiful; and these are merciful and beneficent to others. Now these die as well as others, though holy and righteous, and though Christ has died for them; he has indeed delivered them from death as a punishment, he has abolished it in this sense; and has freed them from the curse and sting of it, but not from that itself; because it is for their good, and it is precious in the sight of the Lord. Saints are precious to him, living and dying; there is something in their death, or that attends it, that is delightful to him, and of high esteem with him; as when they are in the full exercise of grace at such a season; when they die in faith, and have hope in their death; and their love is drawn out unto him, and they long to be with him: besides, they die in the Lord, and sleep in Jesus, in union with him; with whom he is well pleased, and all in him; and they die unto him, according to his will, and are resigned unto it; and so glorify him in death, as well as in life. It is the time of their ingathering to him; at death he comes into his garden, and gathers his flowers, and smells a sweet savour in them; their very dust is precious to him, which he takes care of and raises up at the last day. The commonly received sense of the words is, that the saints are so dear to the Lord, their lives are so much set by with him, and their blood so precious to him, that he will not easily suffer their lives to be taken away, or their blood to be spilled; and whenever it is, he will, sooner or later, severely revenge it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-21.htm">1 Samuel 26:21</a>. And to this sense is the Targum, <p>"precious before the Lord is death sent to (or inflicted on) his saints;'' <p>that is, by men. The words will bear to be rendered, "precious in the sight of the Lord is that death", or "death itself, for his saints"; that very remarkable and observable death, even the death of his Son, which was not only for the good of his saints, for their redemption, salvation, justification, pardon, and eternal life; but in their room and stead; and which was very acceptable unto God, of high esteem with him, of a sweet smelling savour to him: not that he took pleasure in it, simply considered; for he that hath no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, even of a sinner, could have none in the death of his Son; but as hereby his justice was satisfied, his law fulfilled, the salvation of his people procured, and his covenant, counsels, purposes, and decrees, accomplished. has a double in it; one at the beginning, and the other at the end of the word; which is very emphatic, and so may point at something very remarkable; and what more so than the death of Christ? and is sometimes used for substitution, and signifies "for", "instead", or "in the room of", another; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a>. <p>(o) "quos ipse benignitate prosequitur", Junius &amp; Tremellius; so Musculus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/116.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Precious in the sight of the LORD <i>is</i> the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> death of his saints.</span><p>(i) I perceive that God has a care over his, so that he both disposes their death, and takes an account.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/116.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">Precious</span> &c.] Their death is not a matter of indifference to Him.

It is not a matter of indifference to God, when and under what circumstances each of his saints dies. Rather, it is a matter of deep concern to him. "In him are the issues of life and death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>), and he appoints to each man the day and attendant circumstances of his demise. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/116.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With "gracious" and "compassionate" is here associated, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>, the term "righteous," which comprehends within itself everything that Jahve asserts concerning Himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>. from the words "and abundant in goodness and truth" onwards. His love is turned especially toward the simple (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>), who stand in need of His protection and give themselves over to it. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>, is a mode of writing blended out of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;. The poet also has experienced this love in a time of impotent need. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; is accented on the ultima here, and not as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-7.htm">Psalm 142:7</a> on the penult. The accentuation is regulated by some phonetic or rhythmical law that has not yet been made clear (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>).<p>(Note: The national grammarians, so far as we are acquainted with them, furnish no explanation. De Balmis believes that these Milra forms &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;, and the like, must be regarded as infinitives, but at the same time confirms the difference of views existing on this point.)<p>&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; is a resolved Hiphil form, the use of which became common in the later period of the language, but is not alien to the earlier period, especially in poetry (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-18.htm">Psalm 45:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-7.htm">Psalm 116:7</a> we hear the form of soliloquy which has become familiar to us from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497; is Milra here, as also in two other instances. The plural &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; signifies full, complete rest, as it is found only in God; and the suffix in the address to the soul is ajchi for ajich, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3-5</a>. The perfect &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; states that which is a matter of actual experience, and is corroborated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8</a> in retrospective perfects. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm">Psalm 116:8-9</a> we hear <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-14.htm">Psalm 56:14</a> again amplified; and if we add <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, then we see as it were to the bottom of the origin of the poet's thoughts. &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492; belongs still more decidedly than &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; to the resolved forms which multiply in the later period of the language. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a> the poet declares the result of the divine deliverance. The Hithpa. &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; denotes a free and contented going to and fro; and instead of "the land of the living," <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>, the expression here is "the lands (&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;), i.e., the broad land, of the living." There he walks forth, with nothing to hinder his feet or limit his view, in the presence of Jahve, i.e., having his Deliverer from death ever before his eyes. </body></html>
