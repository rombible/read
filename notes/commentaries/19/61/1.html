Thus the soul, being lifted up to God, returns to the enjoyment of itself. Wherever we are, we have liberty to draw near to God, and may find a way open to the throne of grace. And that which separates us from other comforts, should drive us nearer to God, the fountain of all comfort. Though the heart is overwhelmed, yet it may be lifted up to God in prayer. Nay, I will cry unto thee, for by that means it will be supported and relieved. Weeping must quicken praying, and not deaden it. God's power and promise are a rock that is higher than we are. This rock is Christ. On the Divine mercy, as on a rock, David desired to rest his soul; but he was like a ship-wrecked sailor, exposed to the billows at the bottom of a rock too high for him to climb without help. David found that he could not be fixed on the Rock of salvation, unless the Lord placed him upon it. As there is safety in Him, and none in ourselves, let us pray to be led to and fixed upon Christ our Rock. The service of God shall be his constant work and business: all must make it so who expect to find God their shelter and strong tower. The grace of God shall be his constant comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear my cry, O God - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>. The word rendered cry in this place sometimes denotes a joyful shout - a shout of triumph; but the connection makes it certain that it here refers to the voice of prayer. It is implied that it was audible prayer, or that the psalmist gave utterance to his desires in words. It is language such as would be produced by deep distress; when a sad and burdened heart gives vent to its feelings in a loud cry for mercy.<p>Attend unto my prayer - Give ear; incline the ear to me, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-1.htm">Psalm 5:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-6.htm">Psalm 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-2.htm">Psalm 71:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/61.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 61<p>Ps 61:1-8. Neginah&#8212;or, Neginoth (see on [602]Ps 4:1, title). Separated from his usual spiritual privileges, perhaps by Absalom's rebellion, the Psalmist prays for divine aid, and, in view of past mercies, with great confidence of being heard.<p>1-3. From the end&#8212;that is, places remote from the sanctuary (De 28:64).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/61.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.<p>2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.<p>3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.<p>4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a><p>"Hear my cry, O God." He was in terrible earnest; he shouted, he lifted up his voice on high. He is not however content with the expression of his need: to give his sorrows vent is not enough for him, he wants actual audience of heaven, and manifest succour as the result. Pharisees may rest in their prayers; true believers are eager for an answer to them: ritualists may be satisfied when they have "said or sung" their litanies and collects, but living children of God will never rest till their supplications have entered the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth. "Attend unto my prayer." Give it thy consideration, and such an answer as thy wisdom sees fit. When it comes to crying with us, we need not doubt but that it will come to attending with God. Our heavenly Father is not hardened against the cries of his own children. What a consoling thought it is that the Lord at all times hears his people's cries, and is never forgetful of their prayers; whatever else fails to move him, praying breath is never spent in vain!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-2.htm">Psalm 61:2</a><p>"From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee." lie was banished from the spot which was the centre of his delight, and at the same time his mind was in a depressed and melancholy condition; both actually and figuratively he was an outcast, yet he does not therefore restrain prayer, but rather finds therein a reason for the louder sad more importunate cries. To be absent from the place of divine worship was a sore sorrow to saints in the olden times; they looked upon the tabernacle as the centre of the world, and they counted themselves to be at the fag-end of the universe when they could no longer resort to the sacred shrine; their heart was heavy as in a strange land when they were banished from its solemnities. Yet even they knew right well that no place is unsuitable for prayer. There may be an end of the earth, but there must not be an end to devotion. On creation's verge we may call upon God, for even there he is within call. No spot is too dreary, no condition too deplorable; whether it be the world's end or life's end, prayer is equally available. To pray in some circumstances needs resolve, and the Psalmist here expresses it, "I will cry." It was a wise resolution, for had he ceased to pray he would have become the victim of despair; there is an end to a man when he makes an end to prayer. Observe that David never dreamed of seeking any other God; he did not imagine the dominion of Jehovah to be local: he was at the end of the promised land, but he knew himself to be still in the territory of the Great King; to him only does he address his petitions. "When my heart is overwhelmed:" - when the huge waves of trouble wash over me, and I am completely submerged, not only as to my head, but also my heart. It is hard to pray when the very heart is drowning, yet gracious men plead best at such times. Tribulation brings us to God, and brings God to us. Faith's greatest triumphs are achieved in her heaviest trials. It is all over with me, affliction is all over me; it encompasses me as a cloud, it swallows me up like a sea, it shuts me in with thick darkness, yet God is near, near enough to hear my voice, and I will call him. Is not this brave talk? Mark how our Psalmist tells the Lord, as if he knew he were hearing him, that he intended to call upon him: our prayer by reason of our distress may be like to a call upon a far-off friend, but our inmost faith has its quiet heart-whispers to the Lord as to one who is assuredly our very present help.<p>"Lead me to the rock that is higher than I." I see thee to be my refuge, sure and strong; but alas! I am confused, and cannot find thee; I am weak, and cannot climb thee. Thou art so steadfast, guide me; thou art so high, uplift me. There is a mine of meaning in this brief prayer. Along the iron-bound coast of our northern shores, lives are lost because the rocks are inaccessible to the shipwrecked mariner. A clergyman of one of the coast villages has With immense labour cut steps up from the beach to a large chamber, which he has excavated in the chalk cliff: here many mariners have been saved; they have climbed the rock, which had else been too high for them, and they have escaped. We have heard of late, however, that the steps have been worn away by the storms, and that poor sailors have perished miserably within sight of the refuge which they could not reach, for it was too high for them: it is therefore proposed to drive in iron stanchions, and to hang up chain ladders that shipwrecked mariners may reach the chambers in the rock. The illustration is self-interpreting. Our experience leads us to understand this verse right well, for the time was with us when we were in such amazement of soul by reason of sin, that although we knew the Lord Jesus to be a sure salvation for sinners, yet we could not come at him, by reason of our many doubts and forebodings. A Saviour would have been of no use to us if the Holy Spirit had not gently led us to him, and enabled us to rest upon him. To this day we often feel that we not only want a rock, but to be led to it. With this in view we treat very leniently the haft-unbelieving prayers of awakened souls; for in their bewildered state we cannot expect from them all at once a fully believing cry. A seeking soul should at once believe in Jesus, but it is legitimate for a man to ask to be led to Jesus, the Holy Spirit is able to effect such a leading, and he can do it even though the heart be on the borders of despair.<p>How infinitely higher than we are is the salvation of God. We are low and grovelling, but it towers like some tall cliff far above us. This is its glory, and is our delight when we have once climbed into the rock, and Claimed an interest in it; but while we are as yet trembling seekers, the glory and sublimity of salvation appal us, and we feel that we are too unworthy even to be partakers of it; hence we are led to cry for grace upon grace, and to see how dependent we are for everything, not only for the Saviour, but for the power to believe on him.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-3.htm">Psalm 61:3</a><p>"For thou hast been a shelter for me." Observe how the Psalmist rings the changes on, "Thou hast," and "I will," - <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/61-3.htm">Psalm 61:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/61-4.htm">Psalm 61:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/61-5.htm">Psalm 61:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-6.htm">Psalm 61:6</a>. Experience is the nurse of faith. From the past we gather arguments for present confidence. Many and many a time had the persecutions of Saul and the perils of battle emperilled David's life, and only by miracle had he escaped, yet was he still alive and unhurt; this he remembers, and he is full of hope. "And a strong tower from the enemy." As in a fort impregnable, David had dwelt, because surrounded by omnipotence. Sweet is it beyond expression to remember the lovingkindnesses of the Lord in our former days, for he is unchangeable, and therefore will continue to guard us from all evil.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-4.htm">Psalm 61:4</a><p>"I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever." Let me once get back to thy courts, and nothing shall again expel me from them: even now in my banishment my heart is there; and ever will I continue to worship thee in spirit wherever my lot may be cast.

By reason of this he knows himself to be in the free and inalienable possession of the land, and in opposition to the neighbouring nations, Moab, Edom, and Philistia, to be the victorious lord to whom they must bow. The grand word of promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>. is certainly sufficient in itself to make this feeling of certainty intelligible, and perhaps <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8-10</a> are only a pictorial reproduction of that utterance; but it is also possible that at the time when Edom threatened the abandoned bordering kingdom, David received an oracle from the high priest by means of the Urim and Thummim, which assured him of the undiminished and continued possession of the Holy Land and the sovereignty over the bordering nations. That which God speaks "in His holiness" is a declaration or a promise for the sure fulfilment and inviolability of which He pledges His holiness; it is therefore equal to an oath "by His holiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>). The oracle does not follow in a direct form, for it is not God who speaks (as Olshausen thinks), to whom the expression &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1494;&#1492; is unbecoming, nor is it the people (as De Wette and Hengstenberg), but the king, since what follows refers not only to the districts named, but also to their inhabitants. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; might have stood before &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1494;&#1492;, but without it the mode of expression more nearly resembles the Latin me exultaturum esse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>). Shechem in the centre of the region on this side the Jordan, and the valley of Succoth in the heart of the region on the other side, from the beginning; for there is not only a [Arab.] sa&#770;ku&#770;t (the name both of the eminence and of the district) on the west side of the Jordan south of Beisn (Scythopolis), but there must also have been another on the other side of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>.) which has not as yet been successfully traced. It lay in the vicinity of Jabbok (ez-Zerka), about in the same latitude with Shechem (Sichem), south-east of Scythopolis, where Estori ha-Parchi contends that he had found traces of it not far from the left bank of the Jordan. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> gives some information concerning the &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; (valley) of Succoth. The town and the valley belonged to the tribe of Gad. Gilead, side by side with Manasseh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, comprehends the districts belonging to the tribes of Gad and Reuben. As far as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, therefore, free dominion in the cis-and trans-Jordanic country is promised to David. The proudest predicates are justly given to Ephraim and Judah, the two chief tribes; the former, the most numerous and powerful, is David's helmet (the protection of his head), and Judah his staff of command (&#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1511;, the command-giving  equals  staff of command, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>); for Judah, by virtue of the ancient promise, is the royal tribe of the people who are called to the dominion of the world. This designation of Judah as the king's staff or sceptre and the marshal's baton shows that it is the king who is speaking, and not the people. To him, the king, who has the promise, are Joab, Edom, and Philistia subject, and will continue so. Joab the boastful serves him as a wash-basin;<p>(Note: A royal attendant, the tasht-da&#770;r, cup-or wash-basin-bearer, carried the wash-basin for the Persian king both when in battle and on a journey (vid., Spiegel, Avesta ii. LXIX). Moab, says the Psalmist, not merely waits upon him with the wash-basin, but himself serves as such to him.)<p>Edom the crafty and malicious is forcibly taken possession of by him and obliged to submit; and Philistia the warlike is obliged to cry aloud concerning him, the irresistible ruler. &#1505;&#1497;&#1512; &#1512;&#1495;&#1509; is a wash-pot or basin in distinction from a seething-pot, which is also called &#1505;&#1497;&#1512;. The throwing of a shoe over a territory is a sign of taking forcible possession, just as the taking off of the shoe (&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;) is a sign of the renunciation of one's claim or right: the shoe is in both instances the symbol of legal possession.<p>(Note: The sandal or the shoe, I as an object of Arab. wt'&#803;, of treading down, oppressing, signifies metaphorically, (1) a man that is weak and incapable of defending himself against oppression, since one says, ma kuntu na&#8219;lan, I am no shoe, i.e., no man that one can tread under his feet; (2) a wife (quae subjicitur), since one says, g'alaa&#8219; na&#8219;lahu, he has taken off his shoe, i.e., cast off his wife (cf. Lane under Arab. h&#803;id&#817;a'a&#770;', which even signifies a shoe and a wife). II As an instrument of Arab. wt&#803;&#8219;, tropically of the act of oppressing and of reducing to submission, the Arab. wa&#8219;l serves as a symbol of subjugation to the dominion of another. Rosenmller (Das alte und neue Morgenland, No. 483) shows that the Abyssinian kings, at least, cast a shoe upon anything as a sign of taking forcible possession. Even supposing this usage is based upon the above passage of the Psalms, it proves, however, that a people thinking and speaking after the Oriental type associated this meaning with the casting of a shoe upon anything. - Fleischer. Cf. Wetzstein's Excursus at the end of this volume.)<p>The rendering of the last line, with Hitzig and Hengstenberg: "exult concerning me, O Philistia," i.e., hail me, though compelled to do so, as king, is forbidden by the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, instead of which we must have looked for &#1500;&#1497;. The verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; certainly has the general signification "to break out into a loud cry," and like the Hiph. (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>) the Hithpal. can also be used of a loud outcry at violence. </body></html>
