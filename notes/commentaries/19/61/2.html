He alludes to their custom of securing themselves in rocks. God’s power and promise are a rock that is higher than we. In these we must take refuge, and in these must we abide.

Thus the soul, being lifted up to God, returns to the enjoyment of itself. Wherever we are, we have liberty to draw near to God, and may find a way open to the throne of grace. And that which separates us from other comforts, should drive us nearer to God, the fountain of all comfort. Though the heart is overwhelmed, yet it may be lifted up to God in prayer. Nay, I will cry unto thee, for by that means it will be supported and relieved. Weeping must quicken praying, and not deaden it. God's power and promise are a rock that is higher than we are. This rock is Christ. On the Divine mercy, as on a rock, David desired to rest his soul; but he was like a ship-wrecked sailor, exposed to the billows at the bottom of a rock too high for him to climb without help. David found that he could not be fixed on the Rock of salvation, unless the Lord placed him upon it. As there is safety in Him, and none in ourselves, let us pray to be led to and fixed upon Christ our Rock. The service of God shall be his constant work and business: all must make it so who expect to find God their shelter and strong tower. The grace of God shall be his constant comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee - This language is derived from the idea that the earth is one extended plain, and that it has limits or boundaries. Such language is common in the Scriptures, and indeed is in constant use now, even although we know that the earth is globular, and that there are no parts which can properly be called "the ends of the earth." The meaning is plain. The psalmist was far from the place where he was accustomed to live; or, in other words, he was in exile or in banishment. The language agrees well with the supposition that the psalm was composed when David was driven from his home and his throne by Absalom, and was in exile beyond the Jordan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22</a>. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1-11</a>.<p>When my heart is overwhelmed - The word used here - &#1506;&#1496;&#1507;  &#8219;a&#770;t&#803;aph - means properly to cover, as with a garment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a>; then, with grain - as a field, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-14.htm">Psalm 65:14</a>; then, with darkness or calamity, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a> title; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-16.htm">Isaiah 57:16</a>. The meaning here is, that darkness or calamity seemed to have covered or enveloped his soul. He saw no light, he had no comfort. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6-7</a>.<p>Lead me to the rock that is higher than I-- To a rock; to some place of refuge; to some stronghold where I may be safe. The allusion is to God as such a rock or place of refuge. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. The idea is, that he had no strength in himself; that if he depended on himself, he could not be safe. He was, as it were, in a low vale, exposed to every enemy. He wished to be put in a place of safety. To such a place of safety - to Himself - he prayed that God would lead him. We need one much higher than we are to save us. A Saviour - a Redeemer - on the same level with ourselves could not help us. We must have one that is supreme over all things; one that is divine. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/61.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. heart is overwhelmed&#8212;literally, "covered over with darkness," or, "distress."<p>to the rock&#8212;(Ps 18:2; 40:2).<p>higher than I&#8212;which otherwise I cannot ascend.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/61.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the earth; </span> or rather, <span class="ital">of the land</span>; to which David was driven by the tyranny of his enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lead me to the rock that is higher than I; </span> convey me into some high and secure fortress, which I could not reach without thy succour, and where mine enemies cannot come at me.

Where he now was, as is observed on the title; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>, though he was distant from his own house, and from the house of God, he did not restrain prayer before him, but continued to cry unto him, and determined to do so; and as the people of God are sometimes forced to flee to distant parts, they have a God still to go to, who is a God afar off, as well as at hand. It may be the psalmist may represent the church in Gospel times, throughout the whole world, even at the further parts of it, in the isles afar off, where men may and do lift up holy hands to God without wrath and doubting: <p>when my heart is overwhelmed; or "covered" (x); with grief and sorrow for any trouble, outward or inward, and ready to sink, and fail and die. Sometimes the saints are overwhelmed with a sense of sin, are pressed down with the weight and burden of its guilt; their faces are covered with shame and confusion; and their hearts are swallowed up and overwhelmed with overmuch sorrow, both at the number of their sins, and at the aggravated circumstances of them; and especially when they are without a view of pardoning grace and mercy, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-42.htm">Lamentations 3:42</a>; and sometimes they are overwhelmed with afflictive providences; the Lord causes all his waves and billows to go over them, and they are just ready to sink; and did he not stay his hand, and stop contending with them, the spirit would fail before him, and the souls that he has made, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>; and sometimes with divine desertions, which cause a "deliquium" of soul, and throw them into fainting fits, Sol 5:6; and sometimes through unbelieving frames; and did not the Lord appear to them, and strengthen their faith, and remove their unbelief, they would sink and die away, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-2.htm">Psalm 77:2</a>. And at all such times it is right to cry unto the Lord, and make the following request to him: <p>lead me to the rock that is higher than I; not the land of Israel, as Kimchi thinks, the psalmist being now in the low lands of the Philistines; nor Jerusalem, and the fort and hill of Zion; he being now at the extreme and lower parts of the land: this sense is too low. Some think that some great difficulty is meant; which seemed insuperable, and like a rock inaccessible, which he could not get up to, and upon, and get over; and therefore desires the Lord would lead him up it, and over it, before whom every rock, mountain, and hill, becomes a plain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>; but rather Christ is meant, the Rock of Israel, the Rock of our salvation, and our refuge. He is higher than David, and all the kings of the earth; higher than the angels in heaven, and than the heavens themselves, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; and who by his height is able to protect and defend his people from all their enemies; and by the shade he casts to refresh and comfort them; and by the sufficiency in him to supply all their wants; for he is as a rock impregnable, and well stored, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a>. And here gracious souls desire to be led by the Spirit of God always, and especially when in distressing circumstances; and he does lead them to his blood for pardon and cleansing, and to his righteousness for justification and acceptance with God, and to his fulness for fresh supplies. <p>(x) "quum tegitur", Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/61.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">From <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock <i>that</i> is <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> higher than I.</span><p>(a) From the place where I was banished, being driven out of the city and temple by my son Absalom.<p>(b) To which without your help I cannot attain.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/61.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">From the end of the earth</span>] Perhaps, <span class="ital">from the end of the land</span>.

By reason of this he knows himself to be in the free and inalienable possession of the land, and in opposition to the neighbouring nations, Moab, Edom, and Philistia, to be the victorious lord to whom they must bow. The grand word of promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>. is certainly sufficient in itself to make this feeling of certainty intelligible, and perhaps <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8-10</a> are only a pictorial reproduction of that utterance; but it is also possible that at the time when Edom threatened the abandoned bordering kingdom, David received an oracle from the high priest by means of the Urim and Thummim, which assured him of the undiminished and continued possession of the Holy Land and the sovereignty over the bordering nations. That which God speaks "in His holiness" is a declaration or a promise for the sure fulfilment and inviolability of which He pledges His holiness; it is therefore equal to an oath "by His holiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>). The oracle does not follow in a direct form, for it is not God who speaks (as Olshausen thinks), to whom the expression &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1494;&#1492; is unbecoming, nor is it the people (as De Wette and Hengstenberg), but the king, since what follows refers not only to the districts named, but also to their inhabitants. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; might have stood before &#1488;&#1506;&#1500;&#1494;&#1492;, but without it the mode of expression more nearly resembles the Latin me exultaturum esse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>). Shechem in the centre of the region on this side the Jordan, and the valley of Succoth in the heart of the region on the other side, from the beginning; for there is not only a [Arab.] sa&#770;ku&#770;t (the name both of the eminence and of the district) on the west side of the Jordan south of Beisn (Scythopolis), but there must also have been another on the other side of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>.) which has not as yet been successfully traced. It lay in the vicinity of Jabbok (ez-Zerka), about in the same latitude with Shechem (Sichem), south-east of Scythopolis, where Estori ha-Parchi contends that he had found traces of it not far from the left bank of the Jordan. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> gives some information concerning the &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; (valley) of Succoth. The town and the valley belonged to the tribe of Gad. Gilead, side by side with Manasseh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, comprehends the districts belonging to the tribes of Gad and Reuben. As far as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, therefore, free dominion in the cis-and trans-Jordanic country is promised to David. The proudest predicates are justly given to Ephraim and Judah, the two chief tribes; the former, the most numerous and powerful, is David's helmet (the protection of his head), and Judah his staff of command (&#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1511;, the command-giving  equals  staff of command, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>); for Judah, by virtue of the ancient promise, is the royal tribe of the people who are called to the dominion of the world. This designation of Judah as the king's staff or sceptre and the marshal's baton shows that it is the king who is speaking, and not the people. To him, the king, who has the promise, are Joab, Edom, and Philistia subject, and will continue so. Joab the boastful serves him as a wash-basin;<p>(Note: A royal attendant, the tasht-da&#770;r, cup-or wash-basin-bearer, carried the wash-basin for the Persian king both when in battle and on a journey (vid., Spiegel, Avesta ii. LXIX). Moab, says the Psalmist, not merely waits upon him with the wash-basin, but himself serves as such to him.)<p>Edom the crafty and malicious is forcibly taken possession of by him and obliged to submit; and Philistia the warlike is obliged to cry aloud concerning him, the irresistible ruler. &#1505;&#1497;&#1512; &#1512;&#1495;&#1509; is a wash-pot or basin in distinction from a seething-pot, which is also called &#1505;&#1497;&#1512;. The throwing of a shoe over a territory is a sign of taking forcible possession, just as the taking off of the shoe (&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492;) is a sign of the renunciation of one's claim or right: the shoe is in both instances the symbol of legal possession.<p>(Note: The sandal or the shoe, I as an object of Arab. wt'&#803;, of treading down, oppressing, signifies metaphorically, (1) a man that is weak and incapable of defending himself against oppression, since one says, ma kuntu na&#8219;lan, I am no shoe, i.e., no man that one can tread under his feet; (2) a wife (quae subjicitur), since one says, g'alaa&#8219; na&#8219;lahu, he has taken off his shoe, i.e., cast off his wife (cf. Lane under Arab. h&#803;id&#817;a'a&#770;', which even signifies a shoe and a wife). II As an instrument of Arab. wt&#803;&#8219;, tropically of the act of oppressing and of reducing to submission, the Arab. wa&#8219;l serves as a symbol of subjugation to the dominion of another. Rosenmller (Das alte und neue Morgenland, No. 483) shows that the Abyssinian kings, at least, cast a shoe upon anything as a sign of taking forcible possession. Even supposing this usage is based upon the above passage of the Psalms, it proves, however, that a people thinking and speaking after the Oriental type associated this meaning with the casting of a shoe upon anything. - Fleischer. Cf. Wetzstein's Excursus at the end of this volume.)<p>The rendering of the last line, with Hitzig and Hengstenberg: "exult concerning me, O Philistia," i.e., hail me, though compelled to do so, as king, is forbidden by the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, instead of which we must have looked for &#1500;&#1497;. The verb &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; certainly has the general signification "to break out into a loud cry," and like the Hiph. (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a>) the Hithpal. can also be used of a loud outcry at violence. </body></html>
