There is a heritage peculiar to that people; present comforts in the soul, earnests of future bliss. Those that fear God have enough in him, and must not complain. We need desire no better heritage than that of those who fear God. Those abide to good purpose in this world, who abide before God, serve him, and walk in his fear; those who do so, shall abide before him for ever. And these words are to be applied to Him of whom the angel said, the Lord shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and of his kingdom there shall be no end, Lu 1:32. God's promises, and our faith in them, are not to do away, but to encourage prayer. We need not desire to be better secured than under the protection of God's mercy and truth. And if we partake of that grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ, we may praise him, whatever be our outward circumstances. But renewed experience of God's mercy and truth towards his people in Christ, is the main matter of our joy in him, and our praise unto him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/61.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever - As the result of this gracious interposition.

It would be the regular business of his life.<p>That I may daily perform my vows - The solemn promises which I have made in my exile; the purposes which I have expressed to devote myself to thee. Or, the language may have been used in a more general sense, denoting that, as a religious man, the vows of God were constantly on him, or that he had pledged himself to serve God faithfully and always, and that he could better perform this duty at the tabernacle - in the place consecrated to public worship - than he could in exile. He desired, therefore, to be restored to the sanctuary, that he might keep up the performance of the daily duties of religion without interruption or hindrance. The whole psalm indicates a fervent desire to be engaged in the worship and service of God; a desire to be with Him and to enjoy His favor on earth; a confident hope that he would be permitted to enjoy His presence forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/61.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

It is the feeling of homelessness and of separation from the abode of God by reason of which the distance, in itself so insignificant (just as was the case with the exiles later on), became to him immeasurably great. For he still continually needed God's helpful intervention; the enveloping, the veiling, the faintness of his heart still continues (&#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, Arab. &#8219;tf, according to its radical signification: to bend and lay anything round so that it lies or draws over something else and covers it, here of a self-enveloping); a rock of difficulties still ever lies before him which is too high for his natural strength, for his human ability, therefore insurmountable. But he is of good courage: God will lead him up with a sure step, so that, removed from all danger, he will have rocky ground under his feet. He is of good courage, for God has already proved Himself to be a place of refuge to him, to be a strong tower, defying all attack, which enclosed him, the persecuted one, so that the enemy can gain no advantage over him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>). He is already on the way towards his own country, and in fact his most dearly loved and proper home: he will or he has to (in accordance with the will of God) dwell (cf. the cohortative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-21.htm">Jeremiah 4:21</a>) in God's tabernacle (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>) throughout aeons (an utterance which reminds one of the synchronous <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>). With &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is combined the idea of the divine protection (cf. Arabic g&#769;a&#770;r ollah, the charge or proteg of God, and Beduinic g&#769;aur, the protecting hearth; g&#769;awir, according to its form  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, one who flees for refuge to the hearth). A bold figure of this protection follows: he has to, or will trust, i.e., find refuge, beneath the protection of God's wings. During the time the tabernacle was still being moved from place to place we hear no such mention of dwelling in God's tabernacle or house. It was David who coined this expression for loving fellowship with the God of revelation, simultaneously with his preparation of a settled dwelling-place for the sacred Ark. In the Psalms that belong to the time of his persecution by Saul such an expression is not yet to be found; for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>, when it is desired that Doeg may have the opposite of an eternal dwelling-place, it is not the sacred tent that is meant. We see also from its second part that this <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1-8</a> does not belong to the time of Saul; for David does not speak here as one who has drawn very near to his kingly office (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>), but as one who is entering upon a new stage in it. </body></html>
