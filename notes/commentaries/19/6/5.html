Shall the dust praise you? shall it declare your truth?">Psalm 30:9</a>, the sufferer urges as a further reason for Divine aid the loss Jehovah would suffer by the cessation of his praise. The Israelite’s natural dread of death was intensified by the thought that the grave separated him from all the privileges of the covenant with God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18</a>.) There can be neither remembrance of His past mercies there, nor confession of His greatness. The word translated <span class= "ital">grave, </span>in exact parallelism with <span class= "ital">death, </span>is <span class= "ital">sheôl, </span>or <span class= "ital">underworld, </span>in the early conception merely a vast sepulchral cave, closed as rock-tombs usually were by gates of stone or iron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-10.htm" title="I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.">Isaiah 38:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm" title="They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.">Job 17:16</a>). The derivation of the word is disputed, but the primary meaning appears to have been <span class= "ital">hollowness. </span>It occurs sixty-five times in the Bible, and is rendered in the Authorised version three times “pit,” and then with curious impartiality thirty-one times “grave,” and as many “hell.” When it ceased to be merely a synonym for “grave,” and began to gather a new set of ideas we cannot ascertain. It was before the time of which we have any contemporary records. But it acquired these new ideas very slowly. <span class= "ital">Sheol </span>was for a very long time only a magnified grave, into which all the dead, bad and good alike, prince and peasant, went; where they lay side by side in their niches, as the dead do in the loculi of eastern tombs now, without sense of light or sound, or any influence from the upper world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-2.htm" title="I go the way of all the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;">1Kings 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm" title="For I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.">Job 30:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-48.htm" title="What man is he that lives, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.">Psalm 89:48</a>). It is something more than death, put it is not life. The “sleep of death” expresses it. As in Homer’s Hades, the dead are men without the minds or energies of men—“soulless men; so the dead in the Hebrew conception are <span class= "ital">rephaim, </span>that is, weak, shadowy existences. Indeed, the Biblical representation is even less tolerable than the Greek. Homer’s heroes retain many of their interests in the living world; they rejoice in the prosperity of their friends—their own approval or disapproval makes a difference to those still on earth—and, apart from this continued connection with the upper air, they had gone to a realm of their own, with its sovereign lord, its laws and customs, its sanctions, and penalties. Not so in the Jewish belief—“the dead know not anything”; “there is no wisdom in sheol.” It would be of no use for God to show any wonders among those incapable of perceiving them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm" title="For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.">Ecclesiastes 9:5-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm" title="Will you show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise you? Selah.">Psalm 88:10</a>). They have passed altogether from all the interests and relations of life, even from the covenant relation with Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm" title="The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.">Psalm 115:17</a>.) How the Hebrew conscience, helped, possibly, by the influence of foreign ideas, gradually struggled into a higher light on these subjects, belongs to the history of eschatology. The fact that Psalms 6 reflects the earlier undeveloped doctrine, is an argument against any very late date for it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 These verses speak the language of a heart truly humbled, of a broken and contrite spirit under great afflictions, sent to awaken conscience and mortify corruption. Sickness brought sin to his remembrance, and he looked upon it as a token of God's displeasure against him. The affliction of his body will be tolerable, if he has comfort in his soul. Christ's sorest complaint, in his sufferings, was of the trouble of his soul, and the want of his Father's smiles. Every page of Scripture proclaims the fact, that salvation is only of the Lord. Man is a sinner, his case can only be reached by mercy; and never is mercy more illustrious than in restoring backsliders. With good reason we may pray, that if it be the will of God, and he has any further work for us or our friends to do in this world, he will yet spare us or them to serve him. To depart and be with Christ is happiest for the saints; but for them to abide in the flesh is more profitable for the church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in death - In the state of the dead; in the grave.<p>There is no remembrance of thee - They who are dead do not remember thee or think of thee. The "ground" of this appeal is, that it was regarded by the psalmist as a "desirable" thing to remember God and to praise him, and that this could not be done by one who was dead. He prayed, therefore, that God would spare his life, and restore him to health, that he might praise him in the land of the living. A sentiment similar to this occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>, "What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?" So also <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>, "Shall thy loving-kindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?" So also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>, in the language of Hezekiah, "The grave cannot praise thee; death cannot celebrate thee; they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth." See the notes at that passage. A similar sentiment also is found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>. See the notes at that passage. In regard to the meaning of this it may be remarked<p>(a) that it is to be admitted that there was among the ancient saints much less light on the subject of the future state than there is with us, and that they often, in giving utterance to their feelings, seemed to speak as if all were dark beyond the grave.<p>(b) But, though they thus spoke in their sorrow and in their despondency, they also did, on other occasions, express their belief in a future state, and their expectation of happiness in a coming world (compare, for example, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>).<p>(c) Does not their language in times of despondency and sickness express the feelings which "we" often have now, even with all the light which we possess, and all the hopes which we cherish? Are there not times in the lives of the pious, even though they have a strong prevailing hope of heaven, when the thoughts are fixed on the grave as a dark, gloomy, repulsive prison, and "so" fixed on it as to lose sight of the world beyond? And in such moments does not "life" seem as precious to us, and as desirable, as it did to David, to Hezekiah, or to Job?<p>In the grave - Hebrew, &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;  bishe'o&#770;l, "in Sheol." For the meaning of the word, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/7-9.htm">Job 7:9</a>, note. Its meaning here does not differ materially from the word "grave."<p>Who shall give thee thanks? - Who shall "praise" thee? The idea is that "none" would then praise God. It was the land of "silence." See <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18-19</a>. This language implies that David "desired" to praise God, but that he could not hope to do it in the grave. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Besides he speaks of the remembrance or celebration of God’s name and grace in the land of the living, to the enlargement and edification of God’s church, and the propagation of true religion among men; which is not done in the other life, and was justly prized at so high a rate by David and other holy men, to whom therefore it must needs be a great grief to be for ever deprived of such opportunities. For otherwise David very well knew, and firmly believed, that souls departed were not extinct, but did go to God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a></span>, and there remember, and adore, and enjoy God, though quite in another way than that of which he here speaks. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For in death there is no remembrance of thee,.... Of the goodness, truth, power, and faithfulness of God; no notice can be taken nor mention, made either of the perfections or works of God, whether of nature or of grace, by a dead man to others; he is wholly useless to men on earth with respect to these things; <p>in the grave who shall give thee thanks? for mercies temporal or spiritual; the dead cannot praise the Lord among men, only the living; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; wherefore the psalmist desires that he might live and praise the Lord: this argument is taken from the glory of God, which end cannot be answered among men by death, as by life. It does not follow from hence that the soul either dies or sleeps with the body, and is inactive until the resurrection morn, neither of which are true; or that the souls of departed saints are unemployed in heaven; they are always before the throne, and serve the Lord day and night; they remember, with the utmost gratitude and thankfulness, all the goodness and grace of God unto them, and praise him for all his wondrous works: but the sense is, that when a saint is dead, he can no more serve and glorify God on earth among men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For in <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> death <i>there is</i> no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</span><p>(d) He laments that opportunity should be taken from him to praise God in the congregation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. A further plea. There can be no gain in his death. Nay, Jehovah will be the loser by it. For man is created to praise God, and God delights in his praise. But in the state to which man passes at death, he can no longer gratefully call to mind His goodness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-7.htm" title="They shall abundantly utter the memory of your great goodness, and shall sing of your righteousness.">Psalm 145:7</a>), or celebrate His praise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm" title="What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?

They did not look forward to annihilation, but to a dreamy, shadowy, existence which did not deserve the name of life. The dead, they thought, were cut off from all activity and enjoyment, and worst of all, from the consciousness of God’s presence, and from that communion with Him, which is the essence of ‘life’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm" title="For his anger endures but a moment; in his favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.">Psalm 30:5</a>).

It was thought of as a vast subterranean abyss, where all alike were gathered; a place of gloom and silence, but withal of rest, however joyless, for its shadowy denizens have no more power to do harm than good. “There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.” Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/3-13.htm" title="For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,...">Job 3:13-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm" title="Hell from beneath is moved for you to meet you at your coming: it stirs up the dead for you, even all the chief ones of the earth; it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.">Isaiah 14:9</a> ff.

The general view of the psalmists seems to have been that death was a cessation of the active service of God - whether for a time or permanently, they do not make clear to us. So even Hezekiah, in the passage of Isaiah above quoted. Death is represented as a sleep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>), but whether there is an awakening from it does not appear. No doubt, as has been said ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 182), "the cessation of active service, even of remembrance or devotion, does not affect the question of a future restoration," and the metaphor of sleep certainly suggests the idea of an awakening. But such a veil hung over the other world, under the old dispensation, and over the condition of the departed in it, that thought was scarcely exercised upon the subject. Men's duties in this life were what occupied them, and they did not realize that in another they would have employments - much less form any notion of what those employments would be. The grave seemed a place of silence, inaction, tranquillity. <span class="cmt_word">In the grave</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">in Sheol</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who shall give thee thanks?</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17, 18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 5:11-13) The verb &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; or &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; unites in itself the three closely allied meanings of becoming guilty (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-19.htm">Leviticus 5:19</a>), of a feeling of guilt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>.), and of expiation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-22.htm">Psalm 34:22</a>.); just as the verbal adj. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; also signifies both liable to punishment and expiating, and the substantive &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; both the guilt to be expiated and the expiation. The Hiph. &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; signifies to cause any one to render the expiation due to his fault, to make him do penance. As an exception God is here, in the midst of the Jehovic Psalms, called &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, perhaps not altogether unintentionally as being God the Judge. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (with Gaja by the &#1502;&#1503; and a transition of the counter-tone Metheg into Galgal, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a> into Meajla, vid., Psalter ii. 526) is certainly that of the cause in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a>, but here it is to be explained with Olsh. and Hitz. according to Sir. 14:2, Judith 11:6 (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>): may they fall from their own counsels, i.e., founder in the execution of them. Therefore &#1502;&#1503; in the sense of "down from, away," a sense which the parallel &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493; thrust them away (cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-13.htm">Psalm 36:13</a>), presupposes. The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; is to be understood according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm">John 8:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a> "ye shall die &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;." The multitude of their transgressions shall remain unforgiven and in this state God is to cast them into hades. The ground of this terrible prayer is set forth by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1498;. The tone of &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, for a well-known reason (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-40.htm">Psalm 37:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-11.htm">Psalm 64:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>) has retreated to the penult. &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, root &#1502;&#1512;, prop. to be or hold one's self stiff towards any one, compare Arab. ma&#770;rr, tma&#770;rr, to press and stiffen against one another in wrestling, Arab. ma&#770;ra&#770;, tma&#770;ra&#770;, to struggle against anything, whether with outward or mental and moral opposition. Their obstinacy is not obstinacy against a man, but against God Himself; their sin is, therefore, Satanic and on that account unpardonable. All the prayers of this character are based upon the assumption expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>, that those against whom they are directed do not wish for mercy. Accordingly their removal is prayed for. Their removal will make the ecclesia pressa free and therefore joyous. From this point of view the prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a> is inspired by the prospect of the result of their removal. The futt. do not express a wish, but a consequence. The division of the verse is, however, incorrect. The rise of the first half of the verse closes with &#1489;&#1498; (the pausal form by Pazer), its fall is &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1497;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; then the rise begins anew in the second half, extending to &#1489;&#1498; which ought likewise to be pointed &#1489;&#1498;, and &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; is its fall. &#1493;&#1514;&#1505;&#1498; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; (from &#1492;&#1505;&#1498; Hiph. of &#1505;&#1499;&#1498; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>) is awkward in this sequence of thoughts. Hupfeld and Hitzig render it: "they shall rejoice for ever whom Thou defendest;" but then it ought not only to be pointed &#1497;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but the &#1493; must also be removed, and yet there is nothing to characterise &#1514;&#1505;&#1498; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; as being virtually a subject. On the other hand it does not harmonise with the other consecutive futures. It must therefore, like &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, be the optative: "And do Thou defend them, then shall those who love Thy name rejoice in Thee." And then upon this this joy of those who love the name of Jahve (i.e., God in His revelation of Himself in redemption) <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-37.htm">Psalm 69:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-132.htm">Psalm 119:132</a>, is based by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; from a fact of universal experience which is the sum of all His historical self-attestations. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; is used instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; as a graver form of expression, just like &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493; for &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; as an indignant one. The form &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; (Ges. 63, 3) is chosen instead of the &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a>, in order to assist the rhythm. The futt. are continuative. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, cinges eum, is not a contracted Hiph. according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>, but Kal as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-26.htm">1 Samuel 23:26</a>; here it is used like the Piel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a> with a double accusative. The &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (from &#1510;&#1504;&#1503; Arab. tsa&#770;n, med. Waw, Aethiop. &#1510;&#1493;&#1503; to hedge round, guard) is a shield of a largest dimensions; larger than &#1502;&#1490;&#1503;   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>. (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>, where Goliath has his &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; borne by a shield-bearer). &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; "like a shield" is equivalent to: as with a shield (Ges. 118, 3, rem.). The name of God, &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, is correctly drawn to the second member of the verse by the accentuation, in order to balance it with the first; and for this reason the first clause does not begin with &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; here as it does elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-9.htm">Psalm 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>). &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; delight, goodwill, is also a synonym for the divine blessing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>. </body></html>
