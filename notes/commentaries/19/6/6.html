Sickness brought sin to his remembrance, and he looked upon it as a token of God's displeasure against him. The affliction of his body will be tolerable, if he has comfort in his soul. Christ's sorest complaint, in his sufferings, was of the trouble of his soul, and the want of his Father's smiles. Every page of Scripture proclaims the fact, that salvation is only of the Lord. Man is a sinner, his case can only be reached by mercy; and never is mercy more illustrious than in restoring backsliders. With good reason we may pray, that if it be the will of God, and he has any further work for us or our friends to do in this world, he will yet spare us or them to serve him. To depart and be with Christ is happiest for the saints; but for them to abide in the flesh is more profitable for the church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am weary with my groaning - I am exhausted or worn out with it. That is, his sorrows were so deep, and his groaning was so constant, that his strength failed. He became "faint" under the weight of his sorrows. All persons in trouble have experienced this effect - the sense of weariness or exhaustion from sorrow.<p>All the night make I my bed to swim - That is, he wept so much that his bed seemed to be immersed in tears. This is, of course, hyperbolical language, expressing in a strong and emphatic manner the depth of his sorrows.<p>I water my couch with my tears - The word here rendered "water" means to melt, to flow down; then, in the Hiphil, to cause to flow, to dissolve. The sense here is, that he caused his couch to "flow" or "overflow" with his tears. We would say, he "flooded" his bed with tears. This verse discloses the true source of the trials referred to in the psalm. It was some deep mental anguish - some source of grief - that exhausted his strength, and that laid him on a bed of languishing. No circumstances in the life of David better accord with this than the troubles which existed on account of the ungrateful and rebellious conduct of Absalom, and it is most natural to refer it to this. Many a parent since the time of David has experienced "all," both mental and bodily, which is here described as a consequence of the ingratitude and evil conduct of his children. The tragedy of "Lear" turns entirely on this. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

By reason of bodily illness, or indwelling sin, or the guilt of actual transgressions, or the hidings of God's face, or a sense of divine wrath, or the temptations of Satan, or afflictions and crosses of various kinds, or fears of death, or even earnest desires after heaven and eternal happiness, or the low estate of Zion; each of which at times occasion groaning in the saints, as in the psalmist, and is the common experience of all good men. The psalmist being weary of his disease, or of sin, groaned till he was weary with his groaning; inward groaning affects the body, wastes the animal spirits, consumes the flesh, and induces weariness and faintness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-5.htm">Psalm 102:5</a>; <p>all the night make I my bed to swim: I water my couch with my tears; these are hyperbolical phrases (e), expressing more than is intended, and are not to be literally understood; for such a quantity of tears a man could never shed, as to water his couch and make his bed to swim with them, but they are used to denote the multitude of them, and the excessiveness of his sorrow; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-136.htm">Psalm 119:136</a>; and these tears were shed, not to atone and satisfy for sin, for nothing but the blood and sacrifice of Christ can do that; but to express the truth and reality, as well as the abundance of his grief; and this was done "all the night long"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>; when he had leisure to think and reflect upon his sins and transgressions, and when he was clear of all company, and no one could hear or see him, nor interrupt him in the vent of his sorrow, and when his disease might be heavier upon him, as some diseases increase in the night season: this may also be mystically understood, of a night of spiritual darkness and desertion, when a soul is without the discoveries of the love of God, and the influences of his grace; and has lost sight of God and Christ, and interest in them, and does not enjoy communion with them; and throughout this night season weeping endures, though joy comes in the morning. And it may be applicable to David's antitype, to the doleful night in which he was betrayed, when it was the hour and power of darkness, and when he had no other couch or bed but the ground itself; which was watered, not only with his tears, but with his sweat and blood, his sweat being as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground; so he is often said to sigh and groan in spirit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34</a>. <p>(e) See the latter in Homer.

The Hiph. &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; signifies to cause any one to render the expiation due to his fault, to make him do penance. As an exception God is here, in the midst of the Jehovic Psalms, called &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, perhaps not altogether unintentionally as being God the Judge. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (with Gaja by the &#1502;&#1503; and a transition of the counter-tone Metheg into Galgal, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a> into Meajla, vid., Psalter ii. 526) is certainly that of the cause in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a>, but here it is to be explained with Olsh. and Hitz. according to Sir. 14:2, Judith 11:6 (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>): may they fall from their own counsels, i.e., founder in the execution of them. Therefore &#1502;&#1503; in the sense of "down from, away," a sense which the parallel &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493; thrust them away (cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-13.htm">Psalm 36:13</a>), presupposes. The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; is to be understood according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm">John 8:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a> "ye shall die &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;." The multitude of their transgressions shall remain unforgiven and in this state God is to cast them into hades. The ground of this terrible prayer is set forth by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1498;. The tone of &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, for a well-known reason (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-40.htm">Psalm 37:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-11.htm">Psalm 64:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>) has retreated to the penult. &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, root &#1502;&#1512;, prop. to be or hold one's self stiff towards any one, compare Arab. ma&#770;rr, tma&#770;rr, to press and stiffen against one another in wrestling, Arab. ma&#770;ra&#770;, tma&#770;ra&#770;, to struggle against anything, whether with outward or mental and moral opposition. Their obstinacy is not obstinacy against a man, but against God Himself; their sin is, therefore, Satanic and on that account unpardonable. All the prayers of this character are based upon the assumption expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>, that those against whom they are directed do not wish for mercy. Accordingly their removal is prayed for. Their removal will make the ecclesia pressa free and therefore joyous. From this point of view the prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a> is inspired by the prospect of the result of their removal. The futt. do not express a wish, but a consequence. The division of the verse is, however, incorrect. The rise of the first half of the verse closes with &#1489;&#1498; (the pausal form by Pazer), its fall is &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1497;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; then the rise begins anew in the second half, extending to &#1489;&#1498; which ought likewise to be pointed &#1489;&#1498;, and &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; is its fall. &#1493;&#1514;&#1505;&#1498; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; (from &#1492;&#1505;&#1498; Hiph. of &#1505;&#1499;&#1498; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>) is awkward in this sequence of thoughts. Hupfeld and Hitzig render it: "they shall rejoice for ever whom Thou defendest;" but then it ought not only to be pointed &#1497;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, but the &#1493; must also be removed, and yet there is nothing to characterise &#1514;&#1505;&#1498; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; as being virtually a subject. On the other hand it does not harmonise with the other consecutive futures. It must therefore, like &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, be the optative: "And do Thou defend them, then shall those who love Thy name rejoice in Thee." And then upon this this joy of those who love the name of Jahve (i.e., God in His revelation of Himself in redemption) <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-37.htm">Psalm 69:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-132.htm">Psalm 119:132</a>, is based by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; from a fact of universal experience which is the sum of all His historical self-attestations. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493; is used instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; as a graver form of expression, just like &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493; for &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; as an indignant one. The form &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; (Ges. 63, 3) is chosen instead of the &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-4.htm">Psalm 68:4</a>, in order to assist the rhythm. The futt. are continuative. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, cinges eum, is not a contracted Hiph. according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>, but Kal as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-26.htm">1 Samuel 23:26</a>; here it is used like the Piel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a> with a double accusative. The &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (from &#1510;&#1504;&#1503; Arab. tsa&#770;n, med. Waw, Aethiop. &#1510;&#1493;&#1503; to hedge round, guard) is a shield of a largest dimensions; larger than &#1502;&#1490;&#1503;   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>. (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>, where Goliath has his &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; borne by a shield-bearer). &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; "like a shield" is equivalent to: as with a shield (Ges. 118, 3, rem.). The name of God, &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, is correctly drawn to the second member of the verse by the accentuation, in order to balance it with the first; and for this reason the first clause does not begin with &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; here as it does elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-9.htm">Psalm 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>). &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; delight, goodwill, is also a synonym for the divine blessing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>. </body></html>
