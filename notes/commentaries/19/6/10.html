Having made his request known to God, the psalmist is confident that his sorrow will be turned into joy. By the workings of God's grace upon his heart, he knew his prayer was accepted, and did not doubt but it would, in due time, be answered. His prayers will be accepted, coming up out of the hands of Christ the Mediator. The word signifies prayer made to God, the righteous Judge, as the God of his righteousness, who would plead his cause, and right his wrongs. A believer, through the blood and righteousness of Christ, can go to God as a righteous God, and plead with him for pardon and cleansing, who is just and faithful to grant both. He prays for the conversion of his enemies, or foretells their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let all mine enemies be ashamed - Be so brought to see their folly that they shall be ashamed of their conduct.

The same Hebrew word is used here which occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">Psalm 6:2-3</a>, and rendered "vexed." It is a word which denotes trouble, trembling, consternation; and the meaning here is, that the psalmist prayed that they might be confounded or disconcerted in their plans - a prayer which is certainly proper in regard to all the purposes of the wicked. No one should desire that the purposes of the wicked should prosper; and not to desire this is to desire that they may be foiled and overcome in their schemes. This must be the wish of every good man.<p>Let them return - Turn back, or be turned back; that is, let them be repulsed, and compelled to turn back from their present object.<p>And be ashamed suddenly - Hebrew, "In a moment;" instantaneously. He desired that there might be no delay, but that their defeat might be accomplished at once.

Or "they shall be ashamed" (k); and so the following clauses may be rendered, and be considered as prophecies of what would be; though if this be considered as an imprecation, it is wishing no ill; wicked men are not ashamed of their abominations committed by them, neither can they blush; it would be well if they were ashamed of them, and brought to true repentance for them; and if they are not ashamed now, they will be hereafter, when the Judge of quick and dead appears; <p>and sore vexed; or "troubled" (l); as his bones had been vexed, and his soul had been sore vexed by them; as he knew they would be through disappointment at his recovery, and at his deliverance from the distresses and calamities he was now in, when he should sing for joy of heart, and they should howl for vexation of spirit; <p>let them return; meaning either from him, from pursuing after him; or to him, to seek his favour, and be reconciled to him, and be at peace with him, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi explain it; unless this word should only signify "again", as it sometimes does, and be read in connection with what follows; <p>and let them be again ashamed suddenly (m); intimating that his deliverance would be sudden, in a moment, in a very little time, and so would be their disappointment, shame, and confusion.

He founds this cry for help upon his yearning to be able still longer to praise God, - a happy employ, the possibility of which would be cut off from him if he should die. &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, as frequently &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, is used of remembering one with reverence and honour; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; (from &#1493;&#1491;&#1492;) has the dat. honoris after it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>), alternates with &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;.

The writers of the Psalms all (which is no small objection against Maccabean Psalms) know only of one single gathering-place of the dead in the depth of the earth, where they indeed live, but it is only a quasi life, because they are secluded from the light of this world and, what is the most lamentable, from the light of God's presence. Hence the Christian can only join in the prayer of v. 6 of this Psalm and similar passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>.) so far as he transfers the notion of hades to that of gehenna.<p>(Note: An adumbration of this relationship of Christianity to the religion of the Old Testament is the relationship of Islam to the religion of the Arab wandering tribes, which is called the "religion of Abraham" (Din Ibra&#770;him), and knows no life after death; while Islam has taken from the later Judaism and from Christianity the hope of a resurrection and heavenly blessedness.)<p>In hell there is really no remembrance and no praising of God. David's fear of death as something in itself unhappy, is also, according to its ultimate ground, nothing but the fear of an unhappy death. In these "pains of hell" he is wearied with (&#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>) groaning, and bedews his couch every night with a river of tears. Just as the Hiph. &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1492; signifies to cause to swim from &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1492; to swim, so the Hiph. &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1492; signifies to dissolve, cause to melt, from &#1502;&#1505;&#1492; (cogn. &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;) to melt. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1492;, in Arabic a nom. unit. a tear, is in Hebrew a flood of tears.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a> &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; does not signify my "appearance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>), but, as becomes clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-7.htm">Job 17:7</a>, "my eye;" the eye reflects the whole state of a man's health. The verb &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; appears to be a denominative from &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;: to be moth-eaten.<p>(Note: Reuchlin in his grammatical analysis of the seven Penitential Psalms, which he published in 1512 after his Ll. III de Rudimentis Hebraicis (1506), explains it thus: &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; Verminavit. Sic a vermibus dictum qui turbant res claras puras et nitidas, and in the Rudim. p. 412: Turbatus est a furore oculus meus, corrosus et obfuscatus, quasi vitro laternae obductus.)<p>The signification senescere for the verb &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; is more certain.
