The generations of people pass away; the kingdoms of the earth change; the idols perish, but thou art the same. The object here seems to be to bring the image or the idea of God before the mind as he was when he performed these great works, as a God interposing in behalf of his people, and as worthy of praise. The idea is that he is the same now that he was then; and as he then impressed the world with a sense of his majesty and power, and as he then interposed in behalf of his people by mighty signs and wonders, we should feel that, being an unchangeable God, he can do it now, and is now equally worthy. of confidence, adoration, and praise.<p>And thy memorial - Thy remembrance; the memory of thyself. That is, What thou hast done to secure a remembrance among people is of such a nature as to make the same impression to all coming time. The events were such that the memory of them should never pass away from mankind.<p>Throughout all generations - Margin, as in Hebrew, To generation and generation. There never will be a generation on the earth, in the latest periods, to which the memory of these things should not be transmitted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/135.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. heritage&#8212;or, "possession."<p>name &#8230; memorial&#8212;Each denote that by which God is made known.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/135.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These wonderful works of thine shall never be forgotten.

Worthy is He to be praised, for Israel knows full well that He who hath chosen it is the God of gods. The beginning is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>).

The meaning of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not: He makes lightnings into rain, i.e., resolves them as it were into rain, which is unnatural; but either according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a> : He produces lightnings in behalf of rain, in order that the rain may pour down in consequence of the thunder and lightning, or poetically: He makes lightnings for the rain, so that the rain is announced (Apollinaris) and accompanied by them. Instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a>), which does not admit of the retreating of the tone, the expression is &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;, the ground-form of the part.

The metaphor of the treasuries is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>. What is intended is the fulness of divine power, in which lie the grounds of the origin and the impulses of all things in nature. </body></html>
