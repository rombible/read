For Israel therefore conquered because Jehovah fought for them, and put them in possession of that good land when the iniquity of its old inhabitants was full, and cried to heaven for vengeance.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/135.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>135:5-14 God is, and will be always, the same to his church, a gracious, faithful, wonder-working God.
