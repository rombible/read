These the Lord slew by the hand of Moses, a type of Christ; who has destroyed the god and prince of this world, that had the power of death, the devil; and has spoiled all his principalities and powers; <p>and all the kingdoms of Canaan; thirty one of them.

Worthy is He to be praised, for Israel knows full well that He who hath chosen it is the God of gods. The beginning is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>). Heaven, earth, and water are the three kingdoms of created things, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; signifies that which is lifted up, ascended; here, as in Jeremiah, a cloud. The meaning of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not: He makes lightnings into rain, i.e., resolves them as it were into rain, which is unnatural; but either according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a> : He produces lightnings in behalf of rain, in order that the rain may pour down in consequence of the thunder and lightning, or poetically: He makes lightnings for the rain, so that the rain is announced (Apollinaris) and accompanied by them. Instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a>), which does not admit of the retreating of the tone, the expression is &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;, the ground-form of the part. Hiph. for plurals like &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, perhaps not without being influenced by the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; in Jeremiah, for it is not &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; from &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; that signifies "producing," but &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;  equals  &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;. The metaphor of the treasuries is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>. What is intended is the fulness of divine power, in which lie the grounds of the origin and the impulses of all things in nature. </body></html>
