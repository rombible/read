I will call to the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.">1Samuel 12:17</a>. Both of these places refer to showers out of the ordinary rainy season, such as thunder-storms in the harvest season. The sudden downfall of sheets of rain after a flash and peal is even in this climate sufficiently striking to make such a notion as the dependence of rain on lightning quite conceivable, how much more in tropical countries, and where, except in the due rainy season, it would never probably fall without thunder and lightning.<p><span class= "bld">Wind out of his treasuries.—</span>Comp. the Greek and Latin ideas of the “caves” of the winds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/135.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm" title="He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightning for the rain; he brings the wind out of his treasuries.">Psalm 135:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">He causeth the vapours to ascend, </span>&c. — “They who in old time paid their devotions to the elements, imagined those elements to be capable of giving or withholding rain at pleasure. Therefore we find the Prophet Jeremiah reclaiming that power to Jehovah, as the God who made and governed the world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm" title="Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? are not you he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait on you: for you have made all these things.">Jeremiah 14:22</a>. Among the Greeks and Romans we meet with a Jupiter, possessed of the thunder and the lightning, and an Æolus ruling over the winds. The psalmist teacheth us to restore the celestial artillery to its rightful owner. Jehovah, the God of Israel, and Creator of the universe, contrived the wonderful machinery of light and air, by which vapours are raised from the earth, compacted into clouds, and distilled into rain. At his command the winds are suddenly in motion, and as suddenly at rest again; we hear the sound, but cannot tell whence they come, or whither they go; as if they were taken from the secret store- houses of the Almighty, and then laid up till their service was required again.” <span class="ital">He maketh lightnings for the rain </span>— He makes thick clouds, which, being broken, produce lightnings, and so are dissolved into showers of rain. Or, <span class="ital">he maketh lightnings with rain. </span>“It is a great instance of the divine wisdom and goodness that lightning should be accompanied by rain, to soften its rage and prevent its mischievous effects.” — Horne. <span class="ital">He bringeth the wind out of his treasures — </span>Out of those secret places where he preserves them, and whence he brings them as he sees fit.

The Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate, and Luther render it clouds.

Up to the heavens. Aben Ezra interprets this of the mist which went up out of the earth, and watered it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a>; and still vapours are exhaled out of the earth by the force of the sun, and carried up into the air, and form various things, as wind, rain, &amp;c. The Targum, Kimchi, and others, explain it of the "clouds", so called from their elevation on high: these rise up out of the sea, the borders, and boundaries, and uttermost parts of the earth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-44.htm">1 Kings 18:44</a>. Jerom interprets these clouds, spiritually and mystically, of the apostles and prophets, raised from a low and mean estate; and so may be applied to the ministers of the word, who are clouds full of water; of good doctrine, which they are sent to carry about the world, and publish in it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <p>he maketh lightnings for the rain: for the descent of the rain, as the Targum; by lightning oftentimes the clouds are broke, and so pour down rain; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-26.htm">Job 28:26</a>; or, "lightnings with the rain" (g); as Kimchi: these frequently come together, which is very surprising, that two such different elements should meet together as fire and water; and yet the fire not quenched by the water, nor the water heated by the fire: these the above ancient Christian writer interprets of the light of knowledge, and the rain of doctrine; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>; <p>he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries; as he has his treasuries for the snow and hail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>; so for the winds: not the caverns of the earth, thought to be the repositories of the wind (h); nor are there proper repositories of it: but the air, as Suidas (i); which, when without wind, is easily moved by the wise hand of God; so Theodoret, from whom he seems to have taken this hint. In Scripture only mention is made of four winds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9</a>; and so the ancient Greeks only reckoned four cardinal winds, but at length they added four more; and at Athens was a marble temple, built by Andronicus Cyrrhestes, called "the temple of the eight winds": this was an octagon, and on each side were engraven the images of every wind; and on the top of it was a Triton of brass, with a rod in his right hand, which being moved about by the wind, pointed to that which then blew (k): but now, through the great improvement of navigation, the winds are divided and subdivided in the points of the compass; and, besides the four cardinal ones, there are twenty eight collateral ones, in all thirty two; but be they reckoned as many as they may, they are all in the hands of God, and disposed of at his pleasure. Jerom here interprets them of the angels; perhaps it might be better to apply them to the gifts and graces of the Spirit, sometimes compared to wind, which are treasured up in Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>. <p>(g)  "fulgura cum pluvia", Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Gejerus; so Ainsworth.
