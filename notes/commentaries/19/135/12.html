Worthy is He to be praised, for Israel knows full well that He who hath chosen it is the God of gods. The beginning is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16</a>). Heaven, earth, and water are the three kingdoms of created things, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; signifies that which is lifted up, ascended; here, as in Jeremiah, a cloud. The meaning of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not: He makes lightnings into rain, i.e., resolves them as it were into rain, which is unnatural; but either according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a> : He produces lightnings in behalf of rain, in order that the rain may pour down in consequence of the thunder and lightning, or poetically: He makes lightnings for the rain, so that the rain is announced (Apollinaris) and accompanied by them. Instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a>), which does not admit of the retreating of the tone, the expression is &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;, the ground-form of the part. Hiph. for plurals like &#1502;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, perhaps not without being influenced by the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; in Jeremiah, for it is not &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; from &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; that signifies "producing," but &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;  equals  &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;. The metaphor of the treasuries is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>. What is intended is the fulness of divine power, in which lie the grounds of the origin and the impulses of all things in nature. </body></html>
