There is one glory of the sun, which shines forth by day; and there are other glories of the moon and of the stars, which become visible by night. And because day and night interchangeably divide the world between them, they are therefore represented as transmitting in succession, each to other, the task enjoined them, like the two parts of a choir, chanting forth alternately the praises of God.” Thus the instruction becomes perpetual. Every day and every night renews or repeats these documents and demonstrations of God’s glory: so that he who has neglected them yesterday has an opportunity put into his hands again to- day of profiting by their instruction. And, at the same time, the circumstances of their regular, constant, and beneficial vicissitude, set forth and proclaim aloud the excellence of that wisdom and goodness, which first appointed, and still continues it. How does inanimate nature reproach us with our indolence, inattention, and indevotion!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-6 The heavens so declare the glory of God, and proclaim his wisdom, power, and goodness, that all ungodly men are left without excuse. They speak themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have a Creator who is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. The counter-changing of day and night is a great proof of the power of God, and calls us to observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, he forms the light, and creates the darkness, Isa 45:7, and sets the one against the other. The sun in the firmament is an emblem of the Sun of righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, and the Light of the world, diffusing Divine light and salvation by his gospel to the nations of the earth. He delights to bless his church, which he has espoused to himself; and his course will be unwearied as that of the sun, till the whole earth is filled with his light and salvation. Let us pray for the time when he shall enlighten, cheer, and make fruitful every nation on earth, with the blessed salvation. They have no speech or language, so some read it, and yet their voice is heard. All people may hear these preachers speak in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. Let us give God the glory of all the comfort and benefit we have by the lights of heaven, still looking above and beyond them to the Sun of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Day unto day - One day to another; or, each successive day. The day that is passing away proclaims the lesson which it had to convey from the movements of the heavens, about God; and thus the knowledge of God is accumulating as the time moves on. Each day has its own lesson in regard to the wisdom, the power, and the goodness of God, and that lesson is conveyed from one day to another. There is a perpetual testimony thus given to the wisdom and power of the Great Creator.<p>Uttereth speech - The word here rendered uttereth means properly to pour forth; to pour forth copiously as a fountain. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-4.htm">Proverbs 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>. Hence, the word means to utter; to declare. The word "speech" means properly "a word;" and then, "a lesson;" or "that which speech conveys." The idea is, that the successive days thus impart instruction, or convey lessons about God. The day does this by the returning light, and by the steady and sublime movement of the sun in the heavens, and by all the disclosures which are made by the light of the sun in his journeyings.<p>And night unto night showeth knowledge - Knowledge respecting God. Each successive night does this. It is done by the stars in their courses; in their order; their numbers; their ranks; their changes of position; their rising and their setting. There are as many lessons conveyed to man about the greatness and majesty of God by the silent movements of each night as there are by the light of the successive days - just as there may be as many lessons conveyed to the soul about God in the dark night of affliction and adversity, as there are when the sun of prosperity shines upon us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. uttereth&#8212;pours forth as a stream; a perpetual testimony.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Day unto day; </span> or rather, <span class="ital">after</span> (as the Hebrew <span class="ital">lamed</span> oft signifies, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-1.htm" title="And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 16:1</a> 29:38 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments to the LORD.">2 Chronicles 30:21</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-2.htm" title="Sing to the LORD, bless his name; show forth his salvation from day to day.">Psalm 96:2</a></span>) <span class="ital">day</span>; for the day doth not utter this to the day, but to us upon the day.

This, with the following clause, <p>and night untonight showeth knowledge, some understand of the constant and continued succession of day and night; which declares the glory of God, and shows him to be possessed of infinite knowledge and wisdom; and which brings a new accession of knowledge to men; others, of the continual declaration of the glory of God, and of the knowledge of him made by the heavens and the firmament, the ordinances of which always continue; the sun for a light by day, and the moon and stars for a light by night; and so night and day constantly and successively proclaim the glory and wisdom of God: but rather this is to be understood of the constancy of the Gospel ministry, and the continuance of the evangelic revelation. The apostles of Christ persevered in their work, and laboured in the word and doctrine night and day: they were in it at all seasons; yea, were instant in season and out of season; and though they are dead, the Gospel continues, and will do as long as day and night remain: and these, like overflowing fountains, sent forth in great abundance, as the word (x) rendered "uttereth" signifies, the streams of divine light and knowledge; they were full of matter, and their tongues were as the pen of a ready writer; they diffused the savour of the knowledge of Christ, in great plenty, in every place where they came.

This proclamation is continuous and unceasing. “Dies diem docet.” Each day, each night, hands on the message to its successor in an unbroken tradition. Day and night are mentioned separately, for each has a special message entrusted to it: the day tells of splendour, power, beneficence; the night tells of vastness, order, mystery, beauty, repose.

Like the (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;) &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; which is always doxological, &#1495;&#1497; &#1492; (vivus Jahve) is meant as a predicate clause, but is read with the accent of an exclamation just as in the formula of an oath, which is the same expression; and in the present instance it has a doxological meaning. Accordingly &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; also signifies "exalted be," in which sense it is written &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;  equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;) in the other text. There are three doxological utterances drawn from the events which have just been celebrated in song. That which follows, from &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; onwards, describes Jahve once more as the living, blessed (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;), and exalted One, which He has shown Himself to be. From &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; we see that &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1503; is to be resolved as an imperfect. The proofs of vengeance, &#1504;&#1511;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, are called God's gift, insofar as He has rendered it possible to him to punish the attacks upon his own dignity and the dignity of his people, or to witness the punishment of such insults (e.g., in the case of Nabal); for divine vengeance is a securing by punishment (vindicatio) of the inviolability of the right. It is questionable whether &#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; (synonym &#1512;&#1491;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>) here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a> means "to bring to reason" as an intensive of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, to drive (Ges.); the more natural meaning is "to turn the back" according to the Arabic adbara (Hitzig), cf. dabar, dabre, flight, retreat; debira to be wounded behind; medbu&#770;r, wounded in the back. The idea from which &#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; gains the meaning "to subdue" is that of flight, in which hostile nations, overtaken from behind, sank down under him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>); but the idea that is fully worked out in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>, is by no means remote. With &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; the assertion takes the form of an address. &#1502;&#1503; &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; does not differ from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-14.htm">Psalm 9:14</a> : Thou liftest me up away from mine enemies, so that I hover above them and triumph over them. The climactic &#1488;&#1507;, of which poetry is fond, here unites two thoughts of a like import to give intensity of expression to the one idea. The participle is followed by futures: his manifold experience is concentrated in one general ideal expression. </body></html>
