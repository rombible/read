Or, “the light diffused on every side from its fountain, extendeth to the extremities of heaven, filling the whole circle of creation; penetrating even to the inmost substances of grosser bodies, and acting in and through all other matter as the general cause of life and motion.” — Horne. <span class="ital">And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof — </span>There is no part of the earth which doth not, at one time or other, feel the comfort and benefit of its light and heat; and there is no creature which does not, more or less, partake of its influence. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-6 The heavens so declare the glory of God, and proclaim his wisdom, power, and goodness, that all ungodly men are left without excuse. They speak themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have a Creator who is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. The counter-changing of day and night is a great proof of the power of God, and calls us to observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, he forms the light, and creates the darkness, Isa 45:7, and sets the one against the other. The sun in the firmament is an emblem of the Sun of righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, and the Light of the world, diffusing Divine light and salvation by his gospel to the nations of the earth. He delights to bless his church, which he has espoused to himself; and his course will be unwearied as that of the sun, till the whole earth is filled with his light and salvation. Let us pray for the time when he shall enlighten, cheer, and make fruitful every nation on earth, with the blessed salvation. They have no speech or language, so some read it, and yet their voice is heard. All people may hear these preachers speak in their own tongue the wonderful works of God. Let us give God the glory of all the comfort and benefit we have by the lights of heaven, still looking above and beyond them to the Sun of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His going forth - The psalmist now describes that race which he has to run, as borne over the entire circuit of the heavens, from one end of it to another - sweeping the whole space across the firmament.<p>Is from the end of the heaven - From one end of the heaven; that is, from the East, where he starts.<p>And his circuit - The word used here - &#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1508;&#1492;  tequ&#770;pha&#770;h - means properly a coming about, or a return, as of the seasons, or of the year. It is found only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>, "At the year's end;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>, "When the time was come about" (Margin, in revolution of days); <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>, "At the end of the year" (Margin, in the revolution of the year). The word here does not refer to the fact that the sun comes round to the starting-point on the following day, but to the sweep or circuit which he makes in the heavens from one end of it to the other - traveling over the entire heavens.<p>Unto the ends of it - That is, to the other side of the heavens. The plural term is used here perhaps from the idea of completeness, or to denote that there was nothing beyond. The complete journey was made.<p>And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof - The rays of the sun penetrate everywhere. Nothing escapes it. It is not a mere march for show and splendor; it is not an idle and useless journey in the heavens; but all things - vegetables, birds, beasts, men - all that lives - feel the effect of his vital warmth, and are animated by his quickening influence. Thus the sun in his goings illustrates the glory of God. The psalmist was fully alive to the splendor, the glory, and the value of this daily march over the heavens, and shows that while, as in the remainder of the psalm, he dwells on the law of the Lord as having another sphere, and in its place more fully illustrating the divine glory, he is not by any means insensible to the grandeur and beauty of the works of God as showing forth the divine perfections. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6. The sun, as the most glorious heavenly body, is specially used to illustrate the sentiment; and his vigorous, cheerful, daily, and extensive course, and his reviving heat (including light), well display the wondrous wisdom of his Maker.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> His course is constant from east to west, and thence to the east again. There is no part of the earth which doth not one time or other feel the comfort and benefit of its light and heat. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>His going forth is from the end of the heaven,.... From the east, where it rises: <p>and his circuit to the ends of it; to the west, where it sets; which is expressive of the large compass the Gospel administration took in the times of the apostles; whereby the grace of God appeared to all men, shone out in a very illustrious manner, and Christ became, what the sun is to the earth, the light of the world; <p>and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof; though things may be hid from the light of it, yet not from its heat, so forcible and penetrating it is Christ, in the administration of the Gospel to all to whom it comes with power, not only enlightens their minds, but quickens their souls, warms their hearts, causes them to burn within them, arises with healing in his wings upon them, and makes his Gospel the savour of life unto life unto them. The psalmist goes on to say more and excellent things of the Gospel, its nature and usefulness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

He does not broach any astronomical theory. And his circuit (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his course) unto the ends of it; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he proceeds from one end of the heavens to the other. And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. Many things are hidden from the light of the sun, but nothing from its "heat." which is the vital force whence the whole earth receives life and energy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 18:50-51) The praise of so blessed a God, who acts towards David as He has promised him, shall not be confined within the narrow limits of Israel. When God's anointed makes war with the sword upon the heathen, it is, in the end, the blessing of the knowledge of Jahve for which he opens up the way, and the salvation of Jahve, which he thus mediatorially helps on. Paul has a perfect right to quote <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a> of this Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>), together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, as proof that salvation belongs to the Gentiles also, according to the divine purpose of mercy. What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a> as the reason and matter of the praise that shall go forth beyond Israel, is an echo of the Messianic promises in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> which is perfectly reconcileable with the Davidic authorship of the Psalm, as Hitzig acknowledges. And Theodoret does not wrongly appeal to the closing words &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; against the Jews. In whom, but in Christ, the son of David, has the fallen throne of David any lasting continuance, and in whom, but in Christ, has all that has been promised to the seed of David eternal truth and reality? The praise of Jahve, the God of David, His anointed, is, according to its ultimate import, a praising of the Father of Jesus Christ. </body></html>
