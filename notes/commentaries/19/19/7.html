Instead of the free lyric movement of the preceding verse, we come suddenly upon the most finished specimen of didactic poetry in regular metre, exhibiting a perfect balance of expression as well as of thought, so perfect in the original, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/19-7.htm" title="The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.">Psalm 19:7-9</a> the number of words is the same in each clause.

Testimony, from a root meaning “to repeat,” suggests the solemn earnestness and insistence of the Divine commands.<p>The description “perfect” and “sure” suggests the lofty ideal prescribed by the Law, and the reliance which the Hebrew might place upon it as a rule of conduct. The word “simple” is generally used in a bad sense, but here has its primary meaning, “open,” “ingenuous,” “impressible,” easily led either towards folly or wisdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm" title="The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.">Psalm 19:7</a>. </span><span class="ital">The law of the Lord — </span>The doctrine delivered to his church, whether by Moses, or by other prophets and holy men of God after him: for the title <span class="ital">law </span>is not only given to the ten commandments, or the moral law, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-23.htm" title="You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonor you God?...">Romans 2:23-29</a>; but also to the whole word of God, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm" title="But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.">Psalm 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-70.htm" title="Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in your law.">Psalm 119:70</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-8.htm" title="How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?

To recover man out of his fallen state, there is need of the word of God. The word translated law, may be rendered doctrine, and be understood as meaning all that teaches us true religion. The whole is perfect; its tendency is to convert or turn the soul from sin and the world, to God and holiness. It shows our sinfulness and misery in departing from God, and the necessity of our return to him. This testimony is sure, to be fully depended on: the ignorant and unlearned believing what God saith, become wise unto salvation. It is a sure direction in the way of duty. It is a sure fountain of living comforts, and a sure foundation of lasting hopes. The statues of the Lord are right, just as they should be; and, because they are right, they rejoice the heart. The commandments of the Lord are pure, holy, just, and good. By them we discover our need of a Saviour; and then learn how to adorn his gospel. They are the means which the Holy Spirit uses in enlightening the eyes; they bring us to a sight and sense of our sin and misery, and direct us in the way of duty. The fear of the Lord, that is, true religion and godliness, is clean, it will cleanse our way; and it endureth for ever. The ceremonial law is long since done away, but the law concerning the fear of God is ever the same. The judgments of the Lord, his precepts, are true; they are righteous, and they are so altogether; there is no unrighteousness in any of them. Gold is only for the body, and the concerns of time; but grace is for the soul, and the concerns of eternity. The word of God, received by faith, is more precious than gold; it is sweet to the soul, sweeter than honey. The pleasure of sense soon surfeit, yet never satisfy; but those of religion are substantial and satisfying; there is no danger of excess.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The law of the Lord - Margin, doctrine. The word used here - &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;  to&#770;ra&#770;h - is that which is commonly employed in the Old Testament with reference to the law of God, and is usually rendered "law." The word properly means "instruction," "precept," from a verb signifying "to teach." It is then used with reference to instruction or teaching in regard to conduct, and is thus applied to all that God has communicated to guide mankind. It does not here, nor does it commonly, refer exclusively to the commands of God, but it includes all that God has revealed to teach and guide us. It refers here to revealed truth as contradistinguished from the truth made known by the works of creation. Compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>. There are six epithets used in these verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-9</a> to describe the revealed truth of God, all referring to the same truths, but with reference to some distinct view of the truths themselves, or of their effect on the soul: to wit, law, testimony, statutes, commandment, fear, and judgments. Of the revealed truth of God, thus characterized by distinct epithets, a particular statement is first made in each case in regard to the truth itself as viewed in that special aspect, and then the effects of that revealed truth on the soul are described corresponding with that truth as so viewed. Thus, of the "law of the Lord" it is said:<p>(a) that it is perfect,<p>(b) that it converts the soul;<p>Of the "testimony of the Lord":<p>(a) that it is sure,<p>(b) that it makes the simple wise;<p>Of the "statutes of the Lord":<p>(a) that they are right,<p>(b) that they rejoice the heart;<p>Of the "commandment of the Lord":<p>(a) that it is pure,<p>(b) that it enlightens the eyes;<p>Of the "fear of the Lord":<p>(a) that it is clean,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9. The law is described by six names, epithets, and effects. It is a rule, God's testimony for the truth, His special and general prescription of duty, fear (as its cause) and judicial decision. It is distinct and certain, reliable, right, pure, holy, and true. Hence it revives those depressed by doubts, makes wise the unskilled (2Ti 3:15), rejoices the lover of truth, strengthens the desponding (Ps 13:4; 34:6), provides permanent principles of conduct, and by God's grace brings a rich reward.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/19.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>7 The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.<p>8 The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.<p>9 The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.<p>10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.<p>11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.<p>In the three following verses we have a brief but instructive hexapla containing six descriptive titles of the word, six characteristic qualities mentioned, and six divine effects declared. Names, nature, and effect are well set forth.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a><p>"The law of the Lord is perfect;" by which he means not merely the law of Moses but the doctrine of God, the whole run and rule of sacred Writ. The doctrine revealed by God he declares to be perfect, and yet David had but a very small part of the Scriptures, and if a fragment, and that the darkest and most historical portion, be perfect, what must the entire volume be? How more than perfect is the book which contains the clearest possible display of divine love, and gives us an open vision of redeeming grace. The gospel is a complete scheme or law of gracious salvation, presenting to the needy sinner everything that his terrible necessities can possibly demand. There are no redundancies and no omissions in the Word of God, and in the plan of grace; why then do men try to paint this lily and gild this refined gold? The gospel is perfect in all its parts, and perfect as a whole: it is a crime to add to it, treason to alter it, and felony to take from it.<p>"Converting the soul." - Making the man to be returned or restored to the place from which sin had cast him. The practical effect of the Word of God is to turn the man to himself, to his God, and to holiness; and the turn or conversion is not outward alone, "the soul" is moved and renewed. The great means of the conversion of sinners is the Word of God, and the more closely we keep to it in our ministry the more likely are we to be successful. It is God's Word rather than man's comment on God's Word which is made mighty with souls. When the law drives and the gospel draws, the action is different but the end is one, for by God's Spirit the soul is made to yield, and cries, "Turn me, and I shall be turned." Try men's depraved nature with philosophy and reasoning, and it laughs your efforts to scorn, but the Word of God soon works a transformation.<p>"The testimony of the Lord is sure." God bears his testimony against sin, and on behalf of righteousness; he testifies of our fall and of our restoration; this testimony is plain, decided, and infallible, and is to be accepted as sure. God's witness in his Word is so sure that we may draw solid comfort from it both for time and eternity, and so sure that no attacks made upon it, however fierce or subtle, can ever weaken its force. What a blessing that in a world of uncertainties we have something sure to rest upon! We hasten from the quicksands of human speculation to the terra firma of Divine Revelation.<p>"Making wise the simple." Humble, candid, teachable minds receive the word, and are made wise unto salvation. Things hidden from the wise and prudent are revealed unto babes. The persuadable grow wise, but the cavillers continue fools. As a law or plan the Word of God converts, and then as a testimony it instructs; it is not enough for us to be converts, we must continue to be disciples; and if we have felt the power of truth, we must go on to prove its certainty by experience. The perfection of the gospel converts, but its sureness edifies; if we would be edified it becomes us not to stagger at the promise through unbelief, for a doubted gospel cannot make us wise, but truth of which we are assured will be our establishment.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a><p>"The statutes of the Lord are right." His precepts and decrees are founded in righteousness, and are such as are right or fitted to the right reason of man. As a physician gives the right medicine, and a counsellor the right advice, so does the Book of God. "Rejoicing the heart." Mark the progress; he who was converted was next made wise and is now made happy; that truth which makes the heart right then gives joy to the right heart. Free grace brings heart-joy. Earthborn mirth dwells on the lip, and flushes the bodily powers; but heavenly delights satisfy the inner nature, and fill the mental faculties to the brim. There is no cordial of comfort like that which is poured from the bottle of Scripture.<p>"Retire and read thy Bible to be gay."<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The law of the Lord, </span> i.e. the doctrine delivered by God to his church, whether by Moses or by other prophets, and holy men of God after him; for the title of <span class="ital">law</span> is given not only to the ten commandments, or the moral law, as it is <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm" title="You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonor you God?">Romans 2:23</a>,25,27 3:31</span>, but also to the whole word of God, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm" title="But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.">Psalm 1:2</a> 119:70</span> &c.; <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-8.htm" title="How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?

By which is meant, not the law of Moses, or the ten commandments, but the "doctrine" of the Lord; as the word  "torah", signifies, even the whole word of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-20.htm">Isaiah 8:20</a>. All the Scriptures of truth, which are profitable for doctrine; for setting doctrine in a clear light, and for the vindication and establishment of it, and are the rule of doctrine both to preachers and hearers; and which are "perfect", contain the whole mind and will of God, both with respect to faith and practice; whereby the man of God is made perfect, and thoroughly furnished to all good works, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>; and especially the Gospel part of the word of God may be designed, which both in the Old and New Testament is called "a law" or "doctrine", being eminently so; the doctrine of the Messiah, and of justification by faith in his righteousness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>. The Gospel is a perfect plan and scheme of spiritual and saving truths: it gives an account of perfect things; as of the perfect righteousness of Christ, and complete justification by it; of the full as well as free pardon of sins by the blood of Christ; and of redemption and salvation from all sin and evils by him: and it also shows where true perfection is; namely, in Christ, in whom the saints are complete, be being made to them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>. This character, therefore, suits better with the Gospel than with the moral law; though that, as it is to be gathered out of the whole word of God, contains the good and perfect will of God, with respect to what is to be done or avoided; nor is anything to be added to it; nor did our Lord come to add unto it, or to make it more perfect, but to fulfil it, which men could not do; nor could the law make any man or anything perfect, either perfectly sanctify, or justify, or save; whereas the bringing in of the better hope in the Gospel does, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>. The effect, under a divine influence and blessing ascribed to it, is, <p>converting the soul; which is a further proof that the law of Moses is not intended: for though by it is the knowledge of sin, or conviction of sin, which often falls short of conversion; yet the Spirit of God, as a spirit of regeneration, conversion, and sanctification, is not received through the doctrine or preaching of the law, but through the ministration of the Gospel; which is designed to turn men from darkness to light, and from the powers of Satan to God; and which use it has when it is attended with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, though the words may be rendered "relieving", that is, refreshing and comforting the "soul" (z) as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a>; Through want of bodily food, which is the case in the passage retorted to, the spirits faint and sink, the soul is almost gone, when, by the ministration of proper food, it is as it were brought back again, as the word (a) here used signifies, and the animal spirits are cheered and revived: and of like use is the Gospel; it is the food of the soul, by which it is refreshed and exhilarated, when ready to sink and faint away; hereby it is restored and revived, comforted and nourished; <p>the testimony of the Lord is sure; this is another name for the word of God, or the Holy Scriptures; so called because they testify of Christ, of his person, office, and grace; of what he is, was to do, and suffer, and perform for his people, and of his glory that should follow thereon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>; and particularly the doctrine of the Gospel is the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ, both which he himself testified, and which is a testimony concerning him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>. And this is "sure", or "to be believed" (b); the whole of Scripture is true, coming from the God of truth; having for its principal subject Christ, who is truth itself, and being dictated by the Spirit of truth; and particularly the Gospel part of it, and all the truths therein contained, especially the doctrine of salvation by Christ, which is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation: the Gospel is a testimony of record which God himself has bore concerning his Son, and eternal life by him, and therefore sure and to be depended upon; for if the witness of men is received, the witness of God is greater, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm">1 John 5:9</a>. The effect ascribed to the word of God, Or to the Gospel under this character, is, <p>making wise the simple. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, render it "babes" or "children"; and so Apollinarius; and the word  here used in the Arabic language, is said to (c) signify such; and here it intends babes and children not in years, but in understanding, to whom God is pleased to reveal the truths of his Gospel, when he hides them from the wise and prudent: these simple ones are such who are sensible of their simplicity and folly, and of their want of understanding; who, with Agur, think themselves more foolish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man; and these, by the word of God, are made wise to know themselves, their folly, sinfulness, imperfections, and impotence; and are made wise unto salvation, to know the right way of salvation by Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; where the same phrase is used as here, and seems to be borrowed from hence, and is used of the Scriptures; which also make men wise in the knowledge of Gospel doctrines, the wisdom of God in a mystery, which to know is the greatest wisdom and understanding, and much more so than to be acquainted with the law only, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>. <p>(z)  "recreans animam", Vatablus, Schmidt; "refocillat", Piscator.

Some go so far as to say that there is no connection at all between the first and second parts of the psalm. But it is the law and order that pervades the material universe which constitutes its main glory; and the analogy between God's physical laws and his moral laws is evident, and generally admitted (see the great work of Bishop Butler, part 1.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Law of the Lord is perfect.</span> Whatsoever proceeds from God is perfect in its kind; his "Law" especially - the rule of life to his rational creatures.

The Law, by instructing men, restores them from moral blindness to the light which is theirs by nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>), and, as a further consequence, in many cases, restores them from sin to righteousness<span class="cmt_word">.

The sky and firmament are not conceived of as conscious beings which the middle ages, in dependence upon Aristotle (vid., Maimonides, More Nebuchim ii. 5), believed could be proved fro this passage, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>. Moreover, Scripture knows nothing of the "music of the spheres" of the Pythagoreans. What is meant is, as the old expositors correctly say, objectivum vocis non articulatae praeconium. The doxa, which God has conferred upon the creature as the reflection of His own, is reflected back from it, and given back to God as it were in acknowledgment of its origin. The idea of perpetuity, which lies even in the participle, is expanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-3.htm">Psalm 19:3</a>. The words of this discourse of praise are carried forward in an uninterrupted line of transmission. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; (fr. &#1504;&#1489;&#1506;, Arab. nb&#8219;, root &#1504;&#1489;, to gush forth, nearly allied to which, however, is also the root &#1489;&#1506;, to spring up) points to the rich fulness with which, as from an inexhaustible spring, the testimony passes on from one day to the next. The parallel word &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is an unpictorial, but poetic, word that is more Aramaic than Hebrew ( equals  &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;). &#1488;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; also belongs to the more elevated style; the &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; deposited in the creature, although not reflected, is here called &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;. The poet does not say that the tidings proclaimed by the day, if they gradually die away as the day declines, are taken up by the night, and the tidings of the night by the day; but (since the knowledge proclaimed by the day concerns the visible works of God by day, and that proclaimed by the night, His works by night), that each dawning day continues the speech of that which has declined, and each approaching night takes up the tale of that which has passed away (Psychol. S. 347, tr. p. 408). If <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a> were to be rendered "there is no speech and there are no words, their voice is inaudible," i.e., they are silent, speechless witnesses, uttering no sound, but yet speaking aloud (Hengst.), only inwardly audible but yet intelligible everywhere (Then.): then, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a> ought at least to begin with a Waw adversativum, and, moreover, the poet would then needlessly check his fervour, producing a tame thought and one that interrupts the flow of the hymn. To take <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a> as a circumstantial clause to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>, and made to precede it, as Ewald does, "without loud speech...their sound has resounded through all the earth" (341, d), is impossible, even apart from the fact of &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; not meaning "Loud speech" and &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; hardly "their sound." <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4</a> is in the form of an independent sentence, and there is nothing whatever in it to betray any designed subordination to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>. But if it be made independent in the sense "there is no loud, no articulate speech, no audible voice, which proceeds from the heavens," then <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a> would form an antithesis to it; and this, in like manner, there is nothing to indicate, and it would at least require that the verb &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; should be placed first. Luther's rendering is better: There is no language nor speech, where their voice is not heard, i.e., as Calvin also renders it, the testimony of the heavens to God is understood by the peoples of every language and tongue. But this ought to be &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1492; ro &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1</a>). Hofmann's rendering is similar, but more untenable: "There is no speech and there are no words, that their cry is not heard, i.e., the language of the heavens goes forth side by side with all other languages; and men may discourse ever so, still the speech or sound of the heavens is heard therewith, it sounds above them all." But the words are not &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-20.htm">Genesis 31:20</a>), or rather &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-8.htm">Job 41:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; with the part. is a poetical expression for the Alpha privat. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>), consequently &#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is "unheard" or "inaudible," and the opposite of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, audible, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>. Thus, therefore, the only rendering that remains is that of the lxx., Vitringa, and Hitzig: There is no language and no words, whose voice is unheard, i.e., inaudible. Hupfeld's assertion that this rendering destroys the parallelism is unfounded. The structure of the distich resembles <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a>. The discourse of the heavens and the firmament, of the day (of the sky by day) and of the night (of the sky by night), is not a discourse uttered in a corner, it is a discourse in speech that is everywhere audible, and in words that are understood by all, a &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>. </body></html>
