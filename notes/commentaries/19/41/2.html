From his Lord's example the believer learns to consider his poor and afflicted brethren. This branch of godliness is usually recompensed with temporal blessings. But nothing is so distressing to the contrite believer, as a fear or sense of the Divine displeasure, or of sin in his heart. Sin is the sickness of the soul; pardoning mercy heals it, renewing grace heals it, and for this spiritual healing we should be more earnest than for bodily health.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive - This is a farther statement of the same principle, and it refers to a general, not a universal rule in the divine administration, that acts of piety will be partially rewarded on the earth; or that the divine favor will be shown to those who deal kindly with others. This principle is often referred to in the Scriptures. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3-4</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-11.htm">Psalm 37:11</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23-26</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>, note; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. The par ticular application here is, that if any one showed kindness to him that was sick or enfeebled by disease, he might expect that God would interpose in his case under similar circumstances, and would "preserve" him, or "keep him alive." Of course this is to be regarded as a statement made under the general principle. It is not to be interpreted as teaching that this would be universally true, or that he who did this would never die, but the meaning is, that he might look for special divine aid and favor, when he in turn should be sick.<p>And he shall be blessed upon the earth - This is in accordance with the doctrine noticed above, and so often referred to in the Psalms and elsewhere, that the effect of religion will be to promote happiness and prosperity in this life.<p>And thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies - Margin: "Do not thou deliver." The margin, perhaps, expresses most correctly the sense of the original, but still it is an expression of the confident belief of the psalmist that this will not occur; a belief expressed here rather in the form of a prayer than of a direct assertion. The idea is, that he would find God to be a defender and a helper when he was attacked by his foes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. shall be blessed&#8212;literally, "led aright," or "safely," prospered (Ps 23:3).<p>upon the earth&#8212;or land of promise (Ps 25:13; 27:3-9, &c.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Keep him alive, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">quicken him</span>, i.e. revive and restore him.

There is just the same correlation of mercy and truth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a> and here: he wishes continually to stand under the protection of these two saving powers, which he has gratefully proclaimed before all Israel. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>, he bases these desires upon his own urgent need. &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; are the evils, which come even upon the righteous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-20.htm">Psalm 34:20</a>) as trials or as chastenings. &#1488;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is a more circumstantial form of expression instead of &#1488;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>.

He cannot see, because he is closely encompassed on all sides, and a free and open view is thereby altogether taken from him (the expression is used elsewhere of loss of sight, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-15.htm">1 Samuel 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-4.htm">1 Kings 14:4</a>). The interpretation adopted by Hupfeld and Hitzig: I am not able to survey, viz., their number, puts into the expression more than it really expresses in the common usage of the language. His heart, i.e., the power of vital consistence, has forsaken him he is disconcerted, dejected, as it were driven to despair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>).
