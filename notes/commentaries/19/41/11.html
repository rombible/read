One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By this I know - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-6.htm">Psalm 20:6</a>. This indicates a confident assurance that his prayer would be answered, and that he would be restored to health. How he had this assurance we are not informed, but it seems most probable that it was by an intimation conveyed to his mind by God himself. Compare, for a similar case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>. See the notes at that passage.<p>That thou favorest me - That thou dost delight in me; that thou art my friend.<p>Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me - The word here rendered triumph properly means to shout, or to make a noise. As a sign of exultation, more especially in war: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>. Here it means that his enemy would not secure a victory over him; or would not shout as if such a victory were obtained. That is, he felt assured now that all the machinations of his goes would be defeated; that all the hopes which they cherished that he was soon to die would be disappointed; that he himself would be recovered from Iris sickness, contrary to their malicious anticipations and desires. This he regarded as an evidence that God was his friend. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. favourest&#8212;or tenderly lovest me (Ge 34:19), evinced by relief from his enemies, and, farther, God recognizes his innocence by upholding him.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/41.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>11 By this I know thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.<p>12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.<p>13 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen and Amen.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-11.htm">Psalm 41:11</a><p>We all are cheered by tokens for good, and the Psalmist felt it to be an auspicious omen, that after all his deep depression he was not utterly given over to his foe. "By this I know that thou favourest me." Thou hast a special regard to me, I have the secret assurance of this in my heart, and, therefore, thine outward dealings do not dismay me, for I know that thou lovest me in them all. "Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me." What if the believer has no triumph over his foes, he must be glad that they do not triumph over him. If we have not all we would we should praise God for all we have. Much there is in us over which the ungodly might exult, and if God's mercy keeps the dogs' mouths closed when they might be opened, we must give him our heartiest gratitude. What a wonder it is that when the devil enters the lists with a poor, erring, bedridden, deserted, slandered saint, and has a thousand evil tongues to aid him, yet he cannot win the day, but in the end slinks off without renown.<p>"The feeblest saint shall win the day<p>Though death and hell obstruct his way."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-12.htm">Psalm 41:12</a><p>"And as for me," despite them all and in the sight of them all, "thou up-holdest me in mine integrity;" thy power enables me to rise above the reach of slander by living in purity and righteousness. Our innocence and consistency are the result of the divine upholding. We are like those glasses without feet, which can only be upright while they are held in the hand; we fall, and spill, and spoil all, if left to ourselves. The Lord should be praised every day if we are preserved from gross sin. When others sin they show us what we should do but for grace. "He today and I tomorrow," was the exclamation of a holy man, whenever he saw another falling into sin. Our integrity is comparative as well as dependant, we must therefore be humbled while we are grateful. If we are clear of the faults alleged against us by our calumniators, we have nevertheless quite enough of actual blameworthiness to render it shameful for us to boast. "And settest me before thy face for ever." He rejoiced that he lived under the divine surveillance; tended, cared for, and smiled upon by his Lord; and yet more, that it would be so world without end. To stand before an earthly monarch is considered to be a singular honour, but what must it be to be a perpetual courtier in the palace of the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible?<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a><p>The Psalm ends with a doxology. "Blessed be the Lord," i.e., let him be glorified. The blessing at the beginning from the mouth of God is returned from the mouth of his servant. We cannot add to the Lord's blessedness, but we can pour out our grateful wishes, and these he accepts, as we receive little presents of flowers from children who love us. Jehovah is the personal name of our God. "God of Israel" is his covenant title, and shows his special relation to his elect people. "From everlasting and to everlasting." The strongest way of expressing endless duration. We die, but the glory of God goes on and on without pause. "Amen and amen." So let it surely, firmly, and eternally be. Thus the people joined in the Psalm by a double shout of holy affirmation; let us unite in it with all our hearts. This last verse may serve for the prayer of the universal church in all ages, but none can sing it so sweetly as those who have experienced as David did the faithfulness of God in times of extremity. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/41.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou favourest me; </span> bearest a good will to me, and art resolved to make good thy promises to me, and wilt plead my righteous cause against them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me; </span> because hitherto thou hast helped and supported me, and prolonged my days to the disappointment of their hopes and designed triumphs.
