One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/41.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mine enemies speak evil of me - They take occasion to speak evil of me in my weak and feeble state, thus adding to my sorrows. The word "evil" here refers to their calumnies or reproaches. They spoke of him as a bad man; as if it were desirable that he should die; that his influence in the world should come to an end, and that his name should be forgotten.<p>When shall he die - "He is sick; sick on account of his sins; it seems certain that he will die; and it is desirable that such a man should die. But he seems to linger on, as if there were no hope of his dying." Nothing can be imagined more unkind, cutting, severe than this - the desire that a man who is sick shall die, and be out of the way. Nothing could add more to the sorrows of sickness itself than such a wish; than to have it talked about among men - whispered from one to another - that such a man was a nuisance; that he was a bad man; that he was suffering on account of his sins; that it was desirable that his death should occur as soon as possible, and that all remembrance of him on earth should cease.<p>And his name perish - That he should be forgotten altogether; that his name should be no more mentioned; that all the influence of his life should cease forever. Of a truly bad man - a corrupter of the faith and the virtue of others - this is desirable, for the sooner such men are forgotten the better. Forgotten they will be <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>, but there is no more malignant feeling in regard to a good man, and especially when such a man is suffering under a severe disease, than the wish that he should die, and that his name should wholly fade away from recollection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/41.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

That is, the Jews, who were enemies to his person, people, doctrines and ordinances, and would not have him to reign over them; these spake evil of him, charged him with being a glutton and a winebibber; said he had a devil, and was a Samaritan; imputed his miracles to diabolical influence; branded his doctrine with blasphemy, and spoke against his religion and worship, and wished him ill, saying, <p>when shall he die; they had a good will to assassinate him privately, but upon mature deliberation they consulted and determined to take what advantage they could against him, and deliver him up to the Roman governor; they feared, should he go on and succeed, through his doctrines and miracles, as he did, it would go ill with them; and they concluded, could he be brought to death, it would clearly appear to the common people that he was not the Messiah; though this was the very thing he came into the world for, and which he himself was very desirous of; because hereby, and hereby only, the salvation of his people could be brought about; and though this was a thing foretold in prophecy, yet it seems as if Christ's enemies the Jews, and Satan himself, were ignorant of it, and of its virtue and use to save men; however, though it was an ill wish in them, it was well for us that he did die, though the consequence is not as they wished; <p>and his name perish? that is, the fame of his doctrine and miracles, the memory of him and his worthy deeds, particularly his Gospel, which so fully expresses the glory of his person and grace; yea, he himself, for they hoped that upon his death he would come into general disgrace, that his name would never be mentioned but with reproach, that his Gospel would be no more preached, and that he would be accursed of God and men: in all which they were sadly disappointed; for, upon his resurrection from the dead, he had a name given him above every name; his memory became precious to thousands; an ordinance was appointed to remember him to the end of the world in all his churches; his Gospel was ordered to be preached to all the world, as it was; and he himself is blessed for evermore. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/41.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Mine enemies <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?</span><p>(d) That is, curse me and cannot have their cruel hate quenched but with my shameful death.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/41.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">speak evil of me</span>] R.V. against me. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-5.htm" title="My enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?">Psalm 41:5</a></span> takes up <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-2.htm" title="The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed on the earth: and you will not deliver him to the will of his enemies.">Psalm 41:2</a></span>, as <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-4.htm" title="I said, LORD, be merciful to me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against you.">Psalm 41:4</a></span> answers to <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm" title="The LORD will strengthen him on the bed of languishing: you will make all his bed in his sickness.">Psalm 41:3</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">When</span> &c.] The words of the enemies, expressing their impatient eagerness for his death, and even for the extinction of his posterity.

Another head of suffering, viz. misrepresentation, calumny, abuse, on the part of enemies. Absalom had stolen away the hearts of the children of Israel from David by misrepresenting him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-3.htm">2 Samuel 15:3, 4</a>). Shimei had followed the example, adding to his misrepresentation abuse and cursing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>). Absalom's aiders and abettors generally, no doubt, joined in the chorus. This, then, is David's second subject of complaint, and one that he felt keenly - his enemies spoke evil of him. Farther, they desired and anticipated his death. <span class="cmt_word">When</span> (they said) <span class="cmt_word">shall he die, and his name perish?</span> David evidently was, or had been, when his enemies thus spoke, on the bed of sickness, prostrate, and in danger of his life. While he thus suffered, they rejoiced, expecting his early demise. When he was dead, they intended that his name should "perish;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that his memory should be utterly rooted out. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/40.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the midst of such sufferings, which, the longer they last, discover him all the more to himself as a sinner, he prays for speedy help.
