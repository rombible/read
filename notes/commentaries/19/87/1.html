The psalmist’s thoughts, we may suppose, were strongly fixed upon the temple and city of God; he had them full in his view, and was contemplating the glories of them, and at length breaks out into this abrupt expression, which has a reference, though not to what he had written before, yet to what he had deeply thought of; nor was his meaning obscure to any one who knew what had been the subject of his meditation. Thus Dr. Horne: “The psalmist having meditated on the strength, the beauty, and the glory of the holy city, and imagining the thoughts of his hearers or readers to have been employed on the same subject, breaks forth at once in this abrupt manner.” <span class="ital">Is in the holy mountains — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">בהררי קדשׁ</span>, <span class="ital">beharree kodesh, the mountains of holiness; </span>by which he means those mountains, or “hills of Judea, which God had chosen and separated to himself from all others, whereon to construct the highly-favoured city and temple, namely, mount Zion, mount Moriah, and other lesser hills. They are called <span class="ital">holy mountains, </span>or <span class="ital">mountains of holiness, </span>because the city and temple were, in a peculiar sense, consecrated to God, and because God in an especial manner dwelt therein, the ark of his presence being fixed there. The <span class="ital">doctrines, </span>and <span class="ital">merits, </span>and <span class="ital">laws </span>of Christ are those holy mountains on which his church, here typified by the city and temple of Jerusalem, is built; for it is built on Christ our Prophet, Priest, and King, and <span class="ital">other foundation </span>than this <span class="ital">can no man lay. </span>It is founded in and on <span class="ital">holiness; </span>Christ is a holy Prophet, a holy Priest, and a holy King; his doctrine, and merits and laws are all holy. And holiness is the strength and stability of his church; that, and that alone, will support it, and keep it from sinking: not so much,” says Henry, “that it is built upon <span class="ital">mountains, </span>as that it is built on <span class="ital">holy </span>mountains;” upon the word and promise of the holy God, for the confirming of which he <span class="ital">hath sworn by his holiness; </span>upon the mediation of his holy Son, who was <span class="ital">manifested to take away our sins, </span>and <span class="ital">gave himself for his church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it; </span>and upon the sanctifying influence of his holy Spirit and holy laws, all which, taken together, secure both the holiness and happiness of its members.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/87.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>87:1-3 Christ himself is the Foundation of the church, which God has laid. Holiness is the strength and firmness of the church. Let us not be ashamed of the church of Christ in its meanest condition, nor of those that belong to it, since such glorious things are spoken of it. Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, even Jesus Christ. The glorious things spoken of Zion by the Spirit, were all typical of Christ, and his work and offices; of the gospel church, its privileges and members; of heaven, its glory and perfect happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/87.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His foundation - This is an abrupt commencement of the psalm. The adjective "his" has been supposed by some to refer to the psalm itself, and this expression has been considered to be a part of the title to the psalm, meaning that the foundation of the psalm is the holy mountain where the praises of God were celebrated; that is Zion. This, however, is a forced and unnatural interpretation. The most obvious explanation is to refer it to God, and the meaning is, that his "foundation," or that which he had founded and established, to wit, the place for his worship, or for the institutions of religion, was in the holy mountains of Jerusalem. It would seem that the psalmist was contemplating the city - looking on its walls, and its palaces, and especially on the place which had been reared for the worship of God, and that he breaks out in this abrupt manner, by saying that this was what God had founded; that here he had established his home; that here was the place where he was worshipped, and where he dwelt; that this was the place which he loved more than all the other places where the descendants of Jacob dwelt.<p>Is in the holy mountains - The mountains of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is surrounded by hills, and within the city itself there were the hills of Zion, Moriah, Acra, and Bezethah; See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>. These sacred hills God had selected as the place of his solemn worship - of his own abode.

Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The foundation, i.e. the argument or matter, of this Psalm or Song. So these words are thought to be a part of the title, the words lying thus in the Hebrew text, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the sons of Korah, </span> a Psalm or Song whose <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">foundation is in the Holy mountains.</span> But, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The Hebrew word rendered <span class="ital">foundation</span> is no where used in that sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. There is no example of any such like title in the Book of the Psalms. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of the city or temple of God, of which he speaks in the following verses. And whereas the beginning is somewhat abrupt, which seems to be the only ground of the foregoing exposition, that is no unusual thing in Scripture, and the pronoun relative, such as this is, is often put without any foregoing antecedent, and the antecedent is to be fetched out of the following words or verses, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a></span>, <span class="ital">I shall see him</span>, or <span class="ital">it</span>, to wit, the star, which follows afterward; <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-19.htm" title="Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.">Psalm 105:19</a></span>, <span class="ital">his word</span>, i.e. the Lord’s; <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-8.htm" title="Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,">Proverbs 7:8</a></span>, to her house, i.e. the harlot’s, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-10.htm" title="And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtle of heart.">Proverbs 7:10</a></span>; and especially <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-2.htm" title="Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for your love is better than wine.">Song of Solomon 1:2</a></span>, <span class="ital">let him kiss</span>, to wit, my beloved, who is there understood, but not expressed till <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-14.htm" title="I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.">Proverbs 7:14</a></span>. And the ground of that abrupt and imperfect speech there seems to be the same with this here; for as the church was there in deep meditation and a great passion about her beloved, which caused that abruptness of speech, which is usual in such cases, so the psalmist’s thoughts were strongly fixed upon the temple and city of God; and therefore this relative his had a certain antecedent in his thoughts, though not in his words. The word <span class="ital">foundations</span> may possibly be emphatical, because this Psalm might probably be composed when the foundations of the second temple were newly laid, and the old men who had seen the glory of the former house were dejected at the sight of this, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm" title="And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endures for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.">Ezra 3:11</a>,12</span>. And so the meaning of this passage may be this, Be not discouraged, O ye Jews, that your temple is not yet erected and built, but only the foundations of it laid, and those too are mean and obscure in comparison of the magnificence of your former temple; but take comfort in this, that your temple hath its foundations laid, and those sure and firm; sure in themselves, because they are not laid in the sand, nor in boggy or fenny grounds, but in the mountains; and sure by Divine establishment, because those mountains are holy, consecrated to God, and therefore maintained and established by him. Or he may use this word foundations in opposition to the tabernacle, which was movable, and without foundations, to note the stability and perpetuity of this building. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the holy mountains; </span> or, <span class="ital">among or within the holy mountains</span>, to wit, in Jerusalem, which was encompassed with mountains, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm" title="As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.">Psalm 125:2</a></span>, and in which were two famous mountains, to wit, Zion and Moriah.

The Jewish writers connect these words with the title of the psalm, and make the sense to be this; "the foundation" or argument "of it", the psalm, "is concerning the holy mountains" of Zion and Jerusalem; so Aben Ezra, Jarchi, and Kimchi; and the Targum joins them together thus, <p>"by the hands of the sons of Korah is said a song, which is founded by the mouth of the fathers that were of old:'' <p>but the words are a part of the song or psalm, which begins in an abrupt manner, just as Sol 1:2 and may be rendered either "its foundation", or "his foundation", and refer either to the church, or to the Lord, and the sense is the same either way; for the church's foundation is also the Lord's foundation, a foundation of his laying; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-32.htm">Isaiah 14:32</a> and is laid "in the holy mountains"; alluding to the mountains of Zion and Moriah, where the temple stood, a type of the church; or to the mountains about Jerusalem, by which also the church is frequently signified; and by those, in a mystical and spiritual sense, may be meant the purposes and decrees of God, which are as mountains of brass, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>, they are like the ancient mountains for the antiquity of them, and are high, and not to be reached and searched into, and are firm, solid, and immoveable; and are also holy, particularly the decree of election, that source of all true holiness, which has sanctification for its end and means; and is the foundation of the church, which supports and secures it, and stands sure, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>, also the covenant of grace, which is sure and immoveable, and in which are provisions for holiness, internal and external; and is the foundation and security of the church, and all believers; but especially Jesus Christ, the Rock of ages, is meant, the Holy One of Israel, the sure foundation laid in Zion: some interpret these holy mountains of the holy apostles, who were in an high and eminent station in the church, and were doctrinally foundations, as they ministerially laid Christ, as the only foundation; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, it may be rendered, "among the holy mountains" (w); and so may regard, as Cocceius explains it, the several kingdoms and provinces of the world in which the Gospel shall be preached; and the church shall be established and settled in the latter day even upon the tops of mountains, which shall become holy to the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>. <p>(w)  "inter montes sanctitatis", Junius &amp; Tremellius; so Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/87.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><<A Psalm <i>or</i> Song for the sons of Korah.>> His <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> foundation <i>is</i> in the holy mountains.</span><p>(a) God chose that place among the hills to establish Jerusalem and his temple.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/87.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>.

Luther has rightly departed from the renderings of the lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate: laetetur (&#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468; from &#1495;&#1491;&#1492;). The meaning, however, is not so much "keep my heart near to the only thing," as "direct all its powers and concentrate them on the one thing." The following group shows us what is the meaning of the deliverance out of the hell beneath (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, like &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, the earth beneath, the inner parts of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-14.htm">Ezekiel 31:14</a>.), for which the poet promises beforehand to manifest his thankfulness (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-13.htm">Psalm 86:13</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-14.htm">Psalm 56:14</a>). </body></html>
