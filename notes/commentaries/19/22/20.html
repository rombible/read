The very manner of Christ's death is described, though not in use among the Jews. They pierced his hands and his feet, which were nailed to the accursed tree, and his whole body was left so to hang as to suffer the most severe pain and torture. His natural force failed, being wasted by the fire of Divine wrath preying upon his spirits. Who then can stand before God's anger? or who knows the power of it? The life of the sinner was forfeited, and the life of the Sacrifice must be the ransom for it. Our Lord Jesus was stripped, when he was crucified, that he might clothe us with the robe of his righteousness. Thus it was written, therefore thus it behoved Christ to suffer. Let all this confirm our faith in him as the true Messiah, and excite our love to him as the best of friends, who loved us, and suffered all this for us. Christ in his agony prayed, prayed earnestly, prayed that the cup might pass from him. When we cannot rejoice in God as our song, yet let us stay ourselves upon him as our strength; and take the comfort of spiritual supports, when we cannot have spiritual delights. He prays to be delivered from the Divine wrath. He that has delivered, doth deliver, and will do so. We should think upon the sufferings and resurrection of Christ, till we feel in our souls the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deliver my soul from the sword - The word soul here means life, and denotes a living person. It is equivalent to "deliver me." "The sword" is used to denote an instrument of death, or anything that pierces like a sword. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-24.htm">2 Samuel 11:24-25</a>. As applied to the Saviour here, it may mean those extreme mental sufferings that were like the piercing of a sword.<p>My darling - Margin, "my only one." Prof. Alexander, "my lonely one." DeWette, my life. The Hebrew word - &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;  ya&#770;ch&#305;&#770;yd - means "one alone, only," as of an only child; then one alone, as forsaken, solitary, wretched, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>; then it means one only, the only one, in the sense of "most dear, darling." Here, according to Gesenius (Lexicon), it is used poetically for life, as being something most dear, or as denoting all that we have, and, therefore, most precious. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-4.htm">Job 2:4</a>. This is the most probable interpretation here, as it would thus correspond with the expression in the first part of the verse, "deliver my soul."<p>From the power of the dog - Margin, as in Hebrew, from the hand. The enemy is represented, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, as a "dog" (see the notes on that verse); and then that enemy is spoken of as inflicting death by his hand. There is a little incongruity in speaking of a "dog" as having hands, but the image before the mind is that of the enemy with the character of a dog, and thus there is no impropriety in using in reference to him the language which is commonly applied to a man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. my soul&#8212;or self (compare Ps 3:2; 16:10).<p>my darling&#8212;literally, "my only one," or, "solitary one," as desolate and afflicted (Ps 25:16; 35:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From the sword, </span> i.e. from the rage and violence of mine enemies, as the next clause explains it, and as the sword is oft taken in Scripture.

Christ's life was a more precious life than any man's, and peculiarly his own, in such sense as another man's, is not his own; and his soul also was an only one, it was not polluted with original sin, as the souls of other men are; it was pure and holy: the word here used is sometimes rendered "desolate" and "solitary"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>; and it may have this sense here, and be translated "my lonely" or "solitary one" (k); he being forsaken by God, and deserted by his disciples; his soul was in darkness, sorrow, and distress, wherefore he prays it might be delivered "from the power of the dog"; either Satan is so called for his malice and envy, who had put it into the heart of Judas to betray him, and had filled the Pharisees with envy at him, and who through it delivered him to Pilate; or the impure, cruel, and wicked Roman soldiers, and in short all his crucifiers; called in the plural number "dogs"; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>. <p>(i) "unicam meam", V.

If he prayed, even on the cross, to be delivered from it, the prayer must have been offered with the reservations previously made in Gethsemane, "If it be possible" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>); "If thou be willing" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>); "Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt." The human will in Christ was in favour of the deliverance; the Divine will, the same in Christ as in his Father, was against it. My darling - literally, <span class="accented">my only one</span> - from the power of the dog. By "my darling" there is no doubt that the soul is intended, both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>. It seems to be so called as the most precious thing that each man possesses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>). "The dog" is used, not of an individual, but of the class, and is best explained, like the "dogs" in ver. 16, of the executioners. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 22:15-16)Now he described, how, thus encompassed round, he is still just living, but already as it were dead. The being poured out like water reminds us of the ignominious abandonment of the Crucified One to a condition of weakness, in which His life, deprived of its natural support, is in the act of dissolution, and its powers dried up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>); the bones being stretched out, of the forcible stretching out of His body (&#1495;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; to separate, cf.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a> the comparison &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; has reference to the issue of result (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>): my strength is dried up, so that it is become like a potsherd. &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (Saadia) instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; commends itself, unless, &#1499;&#1468;&#1495; perhaps, like the Talmudic &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495; cidumlaT eht eki, also had the signification "spittle" (as a more dignified word for &#1512;&#1511;). &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, with the exception perhaps of <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a>, is uniformly feminine; here the predicate has the masculine ground-form without respect to the subject. The part. pass. has a tendency generally to be used without reference to gender, under the influence of the construction laid down in Ges. 143, 1, b, according to which &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; may be treated as an accusative of the object; &#1502;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497;, however, is acc. loci (cf. &#1500; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-6.htm">Psalm 137:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-10.htm">Job 29:10</a>; &#1488;&#1500; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a>): my tongue is made to cleave to my jaws, fauces meas. Such is his state in consequence of outward distresses. His enemies, however, would not have power to do all this, if God had not given it to them. Thus it is, so to speak, God Himself who lays him low in death. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1514; to put anywhere, to lay, with the accompanying idea of firmness and duration, Arab. t&#817;ba&#770;t, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-12.htm">Isaiah 26:12</a>; the future is used of that which is just taking place. Just in like manner, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>, the death of the Servant of God is spoken of not merely as happening thus, but as decreed; and not merely as permitted by God, but as being in accordance with the divine will. David is persecuted by Saul, the king of His people, almost to the death; Jesus, however, is delivered over by the Sanhedrim, the authority of His people, to the heathen, under whose hands He actually dies the death of the cross: it is a judicial murder put into execution according to the conditions and circumstances of the age; viewed, however, as to its final cause, it is a gracious dispensation of the holy God, in whose hands all the paths of the world's history run parallel, and who in this instance makes sin subservient to its own expiation. </body></html>
