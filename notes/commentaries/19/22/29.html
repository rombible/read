The mention of the “fat upon earth,” as included in this feast, seems certainly out of place, and injures the parallelism. We must change the text to either (1) “Shall eat and do homage all earth’s mourners,” or (2) “Ah! to him shall be bowed all the fat ones of earth.”<p><span class= "bld">They that go down to the <span class= "ital">dust</span></span><span class= "ital">—i.e., </span>those on the point to die through their sufferings.<p><span class= "bld">And none can keep.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">And he who cannot keep his soul alive. </span>Literally, <span class= "ital">has not kept. </span>But the parallelism shows that this is not spoken of those actually dead, but of those not able from poverty to keep body and soul together.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-29.htm" title="All they that be fat on earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.">Psalm 22:29</a></span>. <span class="ital">All they that be fat upon the earth — </span>It was said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm" title="The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.">Psalm 22:26</a>, that the <span class="ital">meek, </span>the <span class="ital">lowly, </span>and <span class="ital">poor </span>should eat and be satisfied: it is here foretold, that the fat ones of the earth; the rich and great, the nobles, princes, and kings, should be called in to partake of the feast. <span class="ital">And worship</span> — This word is added to show what kind of eating he spoke of, that it is a spiritual eating, a feeding upon the bread of life, a partaking of Christ and his benefits. High and low, rich and poor; all mankind are invited to partake of the gospel-feast. <span class="ital">All they that go down to the dust — </span>That is, the whole human race; for none can escape death; <span class="ital">shall bow before him — </span>“As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.” <span class="ital">And none can keep alive his own soul — </span>Can secure or preserve his natural life longer than God is pleased to continue it to him, or can be the author to himself of spiritual and eternal life. It is, therefore, the great interest as well as duty of all to bow before the Lord Jesus; to give themselves up to him to be his subjects and worshippers; for this is the only way, and it is a sure way, to secure happiness when they go down to the dust. Seeing we cannot keep alive our own souls, it is our wisdom, by an obedient faith, to commit our souls to Jesus Christ, who is able to save them, and keep them alive for ever. Observe, reader, all who would partake of the benefits of Christ’s passion, here or hereafter, must worship, confide in, love and obey him as a Saviour and a king, before they are called to bow before and adore him as a judge. But the latter part of this verse is understood differently by some. <span class="ital">All that descend into the dust, </span>they suppose to mean all the poor, who, as well as the rich, are called upon, and shall have the privilege to worship him. <span class="ital">For none can keep alive his own soul </span>— That is, the greatest, as well as the meanest, must acknowledge that their salvation proceeds from him alone.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:22-31 The Saviour now speaks as risen from the dead. The first words of the complaint were used by Christ himself upon the cross; the first words of the triumph are expressly applied to him, Heb 2:12. All our praises must refer to the work of redemption. The suffering of the Redeemer was graciously accepted as a full satisfaction for sin. Though it was offered for sinful men, the Father did not despise or abhor it for our sakes. This ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. All humble, gracious souls should have a full satisfaction and happiness in him. Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness in Christ, shall not labour for that which satisfies not. Those that are much in praying, will be much in thanksgiving. Those that turn to God, will make conscience of worshipping before him. Let every tongue confess that he is Lord. High and low, rich and poor, bond and free, meet in Christ. Seeing we cannot keep alive our own souls, it is our wisdom, by obedient faith, to commit our souls to Christ, who is able to save and keep them alive for ever. A seed shall serve him. God will have a church in the world to the end of time. They shall be accounted to him for a generation; he will be the same to them that he was to those who went before them. His righteousness, and not any of their own, they shall declare to be the foundation of all their hopes, and the fountain of all their joys. Redemption by Christ is the Lord's own doing. Here we see the free love and compassion of God the Father, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, for us wretched sinners, as the source of all grace and consolation; the example we are to follow, the treatment as Christians we are to expect, and the conduct under it we are to adopt. Every lesson may here be learned that can profit the humbled soul. Let those who go about to establish their own righteousness inquire, why the beloved Son of God should thus suffer, if their own doings could atone for sin? Let the ungodly professor consider whether the Saviour thus honoured the Divine law, to purchase him the privilege of despising it. Let the careless take warning to flee from the wrath to come, and the trembling rest their hopes upon this merciful Redeemer. Let the tempted and distressed believer cheerfully expect a happy end of every trial.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All they that be fat upon the earth - The general meaning of this verse is, that "all classes of persons" will come and worship the true God; not the poor and needy only, the afflicted, and the oppressed, but the rich and the prosperous. There are three classes mentioned as representing all:<p>(1) the rich and prosperous;<p>(2) they who bow down to the dust, or the crushed and the oppressed;<p>(3) those who are approaching the grave, and have no power to keep themselves alive.<p>The first class comprises those who are mentioned here as being fat. This image is often used to denote prosperity: <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-29.htm">Judges 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-27.htm">Job 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-10.htm">Psalm 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a> (Hebrew); <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>. The meaning is, that the rich, the great, the prosperous would be among the multitudes who would be converted to the living God.<p>Shall eat and worship - This expression is derived from the custom of offering sacrifices, and of feasting upon portions of the animal that was slain. In accordance with this, the blessings of salvation are often represented as a "feast" to which all are invited. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-16.htm">Luke 14:16</a>.<p>All they that go down to the dust - All those descending to the dust. Those who are bowed down to the dust; who are crushed, broken, and oppressed; the poor, the sad, the sorrowful. Salvation is for them, as well as for the rich and the great.<p>Shall bow before him - Shall worship before the true God.<p>And none can keep alive his own soul - Or rather, and he who cannot keep his soul (that is, himself) alive. So the Hebrew properly means, and this accords better with the connection. The class here represented is composed of those who are ready to perish, who are about to die - the aged - the infirm - the sick - the dying. These, thus helpless, feeble, and sad, shall also become interested in the great plan of salvation, and shall turn unto the Lord. These classes would represent all the dwellers on the earth; and the affirmation is equivalent to a statement that men of all classes would be converted, and would partake of the blessings of salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-31.

These may be opposed to the <span class="ital">fat ones</span> mentioned in the first clause of the verse. <span class="ital">None can keep alive his own soul</span>: this may seem to be a further description of the same persons, and an aggravation of their miserable condition, from this circumstance, that it was not in their power to help themselves; their soul was going down to the dust, as he said in the last foregoing clause, and now he adds that none of them could stop it, or keep himself alive; so that their case was wholly desperate as to themselves; and this drove them out of themselves to seek relief from God, and to receive Jesus Christ and the gospel of salvation gladly. Heb. <span class="ital">and</span> he who (the pronoun relative being here understood, as it is in very many places) <span class="ital">doth not or cannot quicken or enliven his own soul</span>, i.e. himself, as the soul is oft taken; and <span class="ital">quickening</span> may be put either for nourishing, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;">Isaiah 7:21</a></span>, or for <span class="ital">comforting</span>, as here, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm" title="The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.">Psalm 22:26</a></span>, or <span class="ital">preserving life</span>, whether temporal or spiritual and eternal, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-19.htm" title="Behold now, your servant has found grace in your sight, and you have magnified your mercy, which you have showed to me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:">Genesis 19:19</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm" title="And will you pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?">Ezekiel 13:19</a> 18:27</span>. But these words are and may be rendered otherwise, and that very agreeably to the Hebrew text, and the scope of the place. Having said that all nations should <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">bow before him, </span> i.e. before Christ and unto Christ, whom they should own as their Lord and Saviour, he now adds these words, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Because he laid down his life for sinners, which the Father had commanded him, and he had promised to do, therefore God loved him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17</a>,18</span>, and glorified him, and performed his promise made to him upon that condition, that if <span class="ital">he did make his soul an offering for sin</span>, he should see his seed, &c., <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a></span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. As an amplification or commendation of the faith of the Gentiles in coming and bowing to Christ, <span class="ital">although</span> (for so also the Hebrew <span class="ital">vau</span> is often used, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-8.htm" title="You answered them, O LORD our God: you were a God that forgave them, though you took vengeance of their inventions.">Psalm 99:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-24.htm" title="He that hates dissembles with his lips, and lays up deceit within him;">Proverbs 26:24</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-16.htm" title="Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.">Ecclesiastes 9:16</a></span>) <span class="ital">he did not keep alive his own soul</span>, but laid down his own life, and suffered himself to be killed by wicked men; which was one principal reason why the Jews would not believe on him, as is noted, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-40.htm" title="And saying, You that destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself. If you be the Son of God, come down from the cross.">Matthew 27:40</a>,42,43</span>, and therefore was a just commendation to the Gentiles, that, notwithstanding this great stumbling-block, believed on him. But this I propose with submission. Only it may be observed that this last clause of the verse in the Hebrew is in the singular number, and therefore more likely to belong to <span class="ital">him</span>, immediately going before it, which is of the same number, than to the other preceding clauses, which are all expressed in the plural number. And though I know enallage of numbers be very usual, yet they are not to be supposed without necessity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All they that be fat upon earth,.... Rich men, who abound in worldly substance, are in very flourishing and prosperous circumstances, of whom for the most part this is literally true; yea, by these sometimes are meant princes, rulers, the chief among the people in power and authority, as well as in riches; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a>; the phrase may design such who are in prosperous circumstances in their souls, in spiritual things, in faith, comfort, and spiritual joy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-14.htm">Psalm 92:14</a>; but the former sense is best: Jarchi inverts the words, "they shall eat", that is, the meek shall eat, "all the fat of the earth, and worship"; which may be understood of the spiritual blessings of grace, which converted persons shall feed and live upon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>; the allusion may be to the fat parts of the earth, and what grows thereon, made so by ashes, which the word used has the signification of; for some lands are fattened by ashes being strewed upon them (p); but rather the rich and great men of the earth are intended, who yet are but dust and ashes. They <p>shall eat, and worship; for as, in the first times of the Gospel, not many mighty and noble were called, yet some were; so more especially, in the latter day, many of this sort will be called, even kings and queens; who will not live upon their titles of honour, their grandeur and glory, but upon Christ and his Gospel, and will fall down before him, and serve and worship him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>; <p>all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him; such as are in mean circumstances of life; so that both rich and poor shall serve him; or who are mean in their own eyes, sit in the dust of self-abhorrence, and put their mouths in the dust, are in a low condition, out of which the Lord raises them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7</a>. The Targum paraphrases it, "who go down to the house of the grave"; that is, the dead; and then the sense is, that Christ is the Lord, both of the dead and living, and that those that are under the earth, and are reduced to dust, as well as they that live and are fat upon it, shall bow the knee to Christ, when raised again, who is the Judge of quick and dead; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <p>and none can keep alive his own soul; as no man can quicken himself when dead in trespasses and sins; so when he is made alive, he cannot preserve his life, nor nourish himself, nor make himself lively and comfortable, nor cause his heart to live, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a>; but by eating the flesh, and drinking the blood of Christ, feeding and living upon him by faith: though some take the sense to be, that such as are before described as converted persons, will not seek to save their lives, but will freely lay them down and part with them for Christ's sake; but rather the meaning is, that so universal will the kingdom of Christ be, as that high and low, rich and poor, will be bowing to him; whoever are his enemies, and will not have him to rule over them, will be brought before him and slain, and none of them will be able to save themselves; so the Targum, "he will not quicken", or "keep alive, the soul of the wicked"; or as Jarchi interprets it, <p>"he will have no mercy on them, to keep their souls alive from hell.'' <p>(p) "Effoetos cinerem immundum jactare per agros", Virgil.

A most obscure verse. The first line (according to the present text) may be rendered literally,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All earth’s fat ones have eaten and worshipped.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The tense is a ‘prophetic perfect’; with the eye of faith the Psalmist sees homage already paid to Jehovah even by the haughty nobles of the earth. They abandon their proud self-sufficiency, and join in the eucharistic meal with the meek (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm" title="The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.">Psalm 22:26</a></span>), whom once they despised and persecuted. Then he continues<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Before him bow all that were going down to the dust,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Yea he who could not keep his soul alive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Those who were on the edge of the grave, ready to die from want and misery and trouble, come as guests and gain new life. Rich and poor, strong and weak, alike partake of the feast: for it the rich desert their wealth; in it the poor receive the compensation of their privations; and those who were ready to die find life. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined....">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This seems to be the best explanation of the text as it stands; but it is open to serious objections. The reference to the sacrificial meal is very abrupt; the sense given to ‘those that go down to the dust’ is questionable; and the last line drags heavily at the end of the verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Others suppose that the contrast intended is not between rich and poor, but between the living and the dead. ‘Earth’s fat ones’ are those in the full vigour of life: <span class="ital">eat</span> means simply ‘enjoy life’: <span class="ital">all they that have gone down into the dust</span> are the dead. Quick and dead bow in homage before the universal sovereign. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Php 2:10</a>. Attractive as this explanation is, the idea is foreign to the O.T.

An easy emendation, adopted by several critics, simplifies the first line thus:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Surely him shall all earth’s fat ones worship,</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and the second line repeats the thought,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Before him shall bow all they that must go down to the dust.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Earth’s mightiest are but mortals and must yield their homage to the King of kings.

The Christian feast is not for the poor and needy only, like Jewish sacrificial feasts, but for the "fat ones" of the earth as well - the rich and prosperous. As Hengstenberg observes, "This great spiritual feast is not unworthy of the presence even of those who live in the greatest abundance: it contains a costly viand, which all their plenty cannot give - a viand for which even the satisfied are hungry; and, on the other hand, the most needy and most miserable are not excluded" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 396). <span class="cmt_word">All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all mortal men what-soever - all that are on their way to the tomb - shall bow before Christ, either willingly as his worshippers, or unwillingly as his conquered enemies, made to lick the dust at his feet. <span class="cmt_word">And none can keep alive his own soul</span>. Life is Christ's gift; the soul cannot be kept alive except through <span class="accented">him</span>, by his quickening Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53, 63</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 22:23-24)In the third section, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a>, the great plaintive prayer closes with thanksgiving and hope. In certainty of being answered, follows the vow of thanksgiving.

The sufferer is conscious of the significance of his lot of suffering in relation to the working out of the history of redemption.
