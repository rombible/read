Hitzig’s conjecture, “from my cry,” instead of “from my help,” is very plausible, since it makes the parallelism complete and involves a very slight change.

Agreeably to this supposition, it may be further observed, that <span class="ital">Eloi, Eloi, </span>as St. Mark expresses our Saviour’s words, were more nearly Chaldee. Christ, it must be well observed, “was not ignorant of the reason why he was afflicted.

The words then imply, that he had done nothing to merit the evils which he suffered.

We have a sorrowful complaint of God's withdrawings. This may be applied to any child of God, pressed down, overwhelmed with grief and terror. Spiritual desertions are the saints' sorest afflictions; but even their complaint of these burdens is a sign of spiritual life, and spiritual senses exercised. To cry our, My God, why am I sick? why am I poor? savours of discontent and worldliness. But, Why hast thou forsaken me? is the language of a heart binding up its happiness in God's favour. This must be applied to Christ. In the first words of this complaint, he poured out his soul before God when he was upon the cross, Mt 27:46. Being truly man, Christ felt a natural unwillingness to pass through such great sorrows, yet his zeal and love prevailed. Christ declared the holiness of God, his heavenly Father, in his sharpest sufferings; nay, declared them to be a proof of it, for which he would be continually praised by his Israel, more than for all other deliverances they received. Never any that hoped in thee, were made ashamed of their hope; never any that sought thee, sought thee in vain. Here is a complaint of the contempt and reproach of men. The Saviour here spoke of the abject state to which he was reduced. The history of Christ's sufferings, and of his birth, explains this prophecy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to this, each strophe, as Hengstenberg remarks, would consist of ten verses - with an intermediate verse between the 10th and the 12th <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-11.htm">Psalm 22:11</a> connecting the first and second parts. Prof. Alexander supposes that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a> is a connecting link also between the second and third parts.<p>This division, however, seems fanciful and arbitrary; and it will present a more simple and clear view of the psalm to regard it as embracing two main things: I. The condition of the sufferer; and II. His consolations or supports in his travels.<p>I. The condition of the sufferer. This consists of two parts:<p>(1) His sufferings as derived from God, or as they spring from God;<p>(2) as they are derived from men, or as they spring from the treatment which he receives from men.<p>(1) As they are derived from God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1-2</a>.<p>(a) He is forsaken of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>.<p>(b) He cries to him day and night (or continually), and receives no answer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a>.<p>His prayer seems not to be heard, and he is left to suffer apparently unpitied and alone.<p>(2) his sufferings as derived front men, as produced by the treatment which he received from men.<p>Here there are "five" specifications; "five" sources of his affliction and sorrow.<p>"First." He was despised, reproached, derided by them in the midst of his other sufferings, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6-8</a>; especially his piety, or confidence in God was ridiculed, for it now seemed as if God had abandoned him.<p>"Second." His enemies were fierce and ravenous as strong bulls of Bashan, or as a ravening and roaring lion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12-13</a>.<p>"Third." His sufferings were intense, so that his whole frame was relaxed and prostrated and crushed; he seemed to be poured out like water, and all his bones were out of joint; his heart was melted like wax; his strength was dried up like a potsherd; his tongue clave to his jaws, and he was brought into the dust of death, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14-15</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 22<p>Ps 22:1-31. The obscure words Aijeleth Shahar in this title have various explanations. Most interpreters agree in translating them by "hind of the morning." But great difference exists as to the meaning of these words. By some they are supposed (compare [579]Ps 9:1) to be the name of the tune to which the words of the Psalm were set; by others, the name of a musical instrument. Perhaps the best view is to regard the phrase as enigmatically expressive of the subject&#8212;the sufferer being likened to a hind pursued by hunters in the early morning (literally, "the dawn of day")&#8212;or that, while hind suggests the idea of a meek, innocent sufferer, the addition of morning denotes relief obtained. The feelings of a pious sufferer in sorrow and deliverance are vividly portrayed. He earnestly pleads for divine aid on the ground of his relation to God, whose past goodness to His people encourages hope, and then on account of the imminent danger by which he is threatened. The language of complaint is turned to that of rejoicing in the assured prospect of relief from suffering and triumph over his enemies. The use of the words of the first clause of Ps 22:1 by our Saviour on the cross, and the quotation of Ps 22:18 by John (Joh 19:24), and of Ps 22:22 by Paul (Heb 2:12), as fulfilled in His history, clearly intimate the prophetical and Messianic purport of the Psalm. The intensity of the grief, and the completeness and glory of the deliverance and triumph, alike appear to be unsuitable representations of the fortunes of any less personage. In a general and modified sense (see on [580]Ps 16:1), the experience here detailed may be adapted to the case of all Christians suffering from spiritual foes, and delivered by divine aid, inasmuch as Christ in His human nature was their head and representative.<p>1. A summary of the complaint. Desertion by God, when overwhelmed by distress, is the climax of the sufferer's misery.<p>words of my roaring&#8212;shows that the complaint is expressed intelligently, though the term "roaring" is figurative, taken from the conduct of irrational creatures in pain.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/22.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?<p>2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.<p>3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.<p>4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.<p>5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<p>6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.<p>7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying.<p>8 He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.<p>9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.<p>10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a><p>"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? This was the startling cry of Golgotha: Eloi&#770; Eloi&#770; lama sabacthani. The Jews mocked, but the angels adored when Jesus cried this exceeding bitter cry. Nailed to the tree we behold our great Redeemer in extremities, and what see we? Having ears to hear let us hear, and having eyes to see let us see! Let us gaze with holy wonder, and mark the flashes of light amid the awful darkness of that midday-midnight. First, our Lord's faith beams forth and deserves our reverent imitation; he keeps his hold upon his God with both hands and cries twice, "My God, my God!" The spirit of adoption was strong within the suffering Son of Man, and he felt no doubt about his interest in his God. Oh that we could imitate this cleaving to an afflicting God! Nor does the sufferer distrust the power of God to sustain him, for the title used - "El" - signifies strength, and is the name of the Mighty God. He knows the Lord to be the all-sufficient support and succour of his spirit, and therefore appeals to him in the agony of grief, but not in the misery of doubt. He would fain know why he is left, he raises that question and repeats it, but neither the power nor the faithfulness of God does he mistrust. What an enquiry is this before us! "Why hast thou forsaken me?" We must lay the emphasis on every word of this saddest of all utterances. "Why?" what is the great cause of such a strange fact as for God to leave his own Son at such a time and in such a plight? There was no cause in him, why then was he deserted? "Hast:" it is done, and the Saviour is feeling its dread effect as he asks the question; it is surely true, but how mysterious! It was no threatening of forsaking which made the great Surety cry aloud, he endured that forsaking in very deed. "Thou:" I can understand why traitorous Judas and timid Peter should be gone, but thou, my God, my faithful friend, how canst thou leave me? This is worst of all, yea worse than all put together. Hell itself has for its fiercest flame the separation of the soul from God. "Forsaken:" if thou hadst chastened I might bear it, for they face would shine; but to forsake me utterly, ah! why is this? "Me:" thine innocent, obedient, suffering Son, why leavest thou me to perish? A sight of self seen by penitence, and of Jesus on the cross seen by faith will best expound this question. Jesus is forsaken because our sins had separated between us and our God.<p>"Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?" The Man of Sorrows had prayed until his speech failed him, and he could only utter moanings and groanings as men do in severe sicknesses, like the roarings of a wounded animal. To what extremity of grief was our Master driven! What strong crying and tears were those which made him too hoarse for speech! What must have been his anguish to find his own beloved and trusted Father standing afar off, and neither granting help nor apparently hearing prayer. This was good cause to make him "roar." Yet there was a reason for all this which those who rest in Jesus as their Substitute well know.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a><p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That question mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-34.htm" title="And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?">Acts 8:34</a></span>, is very proper here. <span class="ital">Of whom speaketh the prophet this (Psalm)? of himself, or of some other man?</span> It is confessed that David was a type of Christ, and that many Psalms, or passages of the Psalms, though properly and literally understood of David, yet had a further and mystical reference to Christ, in whom they were accomplished. But there are some other Psalms, or passages in the Psalms, as also some chapters or passages in other prophets, especially in Isaiah, who lived not very long after David, which either by those sacred penmen, or at least by the Holy Ghost inspiring them, which is one and the same thing, were directly, primarily, and immediately intended for, and areproperly and literally to be understood of, the Messias; though withal there may be some respect and allusion to the state of the penman himself, who being a type of Christ, it is not strange if there be many resemblances between them. And this seems to be the state of this Psalm, which is understood of the Messias by the Hebrew doctors themselves, and by Christ himself, and by his apostles, as we shall see. And there are many passages in it, which are most literally accomplished in him, and cannot in a tolerable sense be understood of any other, as we shall see in the particular verses. And therefore I doubt not that David, though he had an eye to his own condition in divers passages here used, yet was carried forth by the Spirit of prophecy beyond himself, and unto Christ, to whom alone it truly and fully agrees. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Aijeleth Shahar</span>; or, <span class="ital">the hind of the morning</span>, to note that the person here designed was like a hind, comely and meek, and every way lovely, but withal persecuted by wicked men, and that oftentimes is <span class="ital">in the morning</span>, when she comes out of her lurking and lodging place, and when the hunters use to go abroad to their work.

God is the God of Christ as he is man; he prepared a body for him, an human nature; anointed it with the oil of gladness; supported it under all its sorrows and sufferings, and at last exalted it at his own right hand:, and Christ behaved towards him as his covenant God; prayed to him, believed in him, loved him, and was obedient to him as such; and here expresses his faith of interest in him, when he hid his face from him, on account of which he expostulates with him thus, "why hast thou forsaken me?" which is to be understood, not as if the hypostatical or personal union of the divine and human natures were dissolved, or that the one was now separated from the other: for the fulness of the Godhead still dwelt bodily in him; nor that he ceased to be the object of the Father's love; for so he was in the midst of all his sufferings, yea, his Father loved him because he laid down his life for the sheep; nor that the principle of joy and comfort was lost in him, only the act and sense of it; he was now deprived of the gracious presence of God, of the manifestations of his love to his human soul, and had a sense of divine wrath, not for his own sins, but for the sins of his people, and was for a while destitute of help and comfort; all which were necessary in order to make satisfaction for sin: for as he had the sins of his people imputed to him, he must bear the whole punishment of them, which is twofold the punishment of loss and the punishment of sense; the former lies in a deprivation of the divine presence, and the latter in a sense of divine wrath, and both Christ sustained as the surety of his people. This expostulation is made not as ignorant of the reason of it; he knew that as he was wounded and bruised for the sins of his people, he was deserted on the same account; nor as impatient, for he was a mirror of patience in all his sufferings; and much less as in despair; for, in these very words, he strongly expresses and repeats his faith of interest in God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>; and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>. But this is done to set forth the greatness and bitterness of his sufferings; that not only men hid their faces from him, and the sun in the firmament withdrew its light and heat from him, but, what was most grievous of all, his God departed from him. From hence it appears that he was truly man, had an human soul, and endured sorrows and sufferings in it; and this may be of use to his members, to expect the hidings of God's face, though on another account; and to teach them to wait patiently for him, and to trust in the Lord, and stay themselves upon their God, even while they walk in darkness and see no light; <p>why art thou so far from helping me? or from my salvation; from saving and delivering him out of his sorrows and sufferings? not that he despaired of help; he firmly believed he should have it, and accordingly had it: but he expostulates about the deferring of it. He adds, <p>and from the words of my roaring? which expresses the vehemency of his spirit in crying to God, the exceeding greatness of his sorrows, and his excruciating pains and sufferings: this is what the apostle means by his "strong crying and tears", <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>; or "the words of my roaring are far from my salvation"; there is a great space or interval between the one and the other, as Gussetius (u) observes. <p>(u) Comment.

Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-1.htm" title="Why stand you afar off, O LORD? why hide you yourself in times of trouble?">Psalm 10:1</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-11.htm" title="Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.">Psalm 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-19.htm" title="But be not you far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste you to help me.">Psalm 22:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my roaring</span>] The groaning of the sufferer in his distress is compared to the lion’s roar.

It is remarkable that our Lord's quotation of this passage does not follow <span class="accented">exactly</span> either the Hebrew or the Chaldee paraphrase - the Hebrew having '<span class="accented">azab-thani</span> for <span class="accented">sabacthani</span>, and the Chaldee paraphrase <span class="accented">metul ma</span> for <span class="accented">lama.</span> May we not conclude that it is the thought, and not its verbal expression by the sacred writers, that is inspired? <span class="cmt_word">Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</span> It is very doubtful whether our translators have done right in supplying the words which they have added.

The address to God is now changed into an address to the king; not, however, expressive of the wishes, but of the confident expectation, of the speakers. Hengstenberg rightly regards <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8</a> as the transition to the second half; for by its objective utterance concerning the king and God, it separates the language hitherto addressed to God, from the address to the king, which follows. We do not render <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8</a>: and trusting in the favour of the Most High - he shall not be moved; the mercy is the response of the trust, which (trust) does not suffer him to be moved; on the expression, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-30.htm">Proverbs 10:30</a>. This inference is now expanded in respect to the enemies who desire to cause him to totter and fall. So far from any tottering, he, on the contrary, makes a victorious assault upon his foes. If the words had been addressed to Jahve, it ought, in order to keep up the connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8</a>, at least to have been &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; (his, i.e., the king's, enemies). What the people now hope on behalf of their king, they here express beforehand in the form of a prophecy. &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1500; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>) and &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; seq. acc. (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>) are distinguished as: to reach towards, or up to anything, and to reach anything, attain it. Supposing &#1500; to represent the accusative, as e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-6.htm">Psalm 69:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a> would be a useless repetition. </body></html>
