There were righteousness and peace at first in the administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at an end. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of the Messiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which were to have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far as his kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families, churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance of peace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cut down, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needs not the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Those that have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do good with it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever we ask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered to him: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall be feared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be praised. All nations shall call HIM blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/72.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In his days shall the righteous flourish - It will be a period when just and upright people will be protected, or when they shall receive the countenance of him who reigns. The administration of the kingdom that is to be set up will be in favor of righteousness or justice. The word "flourish" here is derived from the growth of plants - as plants sprout, or spring up - an emblem of prosperity.<p>And abundance of peace - literally, "multitude of peace;" that is, The things which produce peace, or which indicate peace, will not be few, but numerous; they will abound everywhere. They will be found in towns and villages, and private dwellings; in the calm and just administration of the affairs of the State; in abundant harvests; in intelligence, in education, and in undisturbed industry; in the protection extended to the rights of all.<p>So long as the moon endureth - Margin, as in Hebrew, "until there be no moon." That is, until the moon shall cease to shine upon the earth.

As the grass of the field, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>; the dews and rain of grace descending upon them; and as a branch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>. They being branches in Christ the vine, flourish and bring forth fruit; and as the palm tree, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>; which the more it is pressed with weights, the more it grows; so they, the more they are afflicted, as the Israelites, the more they grow in grace and experience, and become fruitful in every good word and work; which is owing to their being planted in a good soil, in the house and courts of the Lord, where the word is preached, and ordinances administered; to their being rooted and grounded in the love of God and grace of Christ; to their being watered continually with the dews of divine favour; enjoying the bright shining of the sun of righteousness, and the refreshing gales of the divine Spirit, like the south wind upon them, causing their spices to flow out. The Targum is, <p>"in his days the righteous shall be multiplied;'' <p>when the forces and fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in, and the nation of the Jews shall be born at once: in the latter days of the Messiah, all the Lord's people shall be righteous; and none but righteous persons shall dwell in the new heavens and earth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>. This is to be understood not of persons outwardly righteous only; nor that are so in their own conceit; nor that seek for righteousness by the works of the law, or depend on an external profession of religion; for such never flourish, nor grow in grace, who have no grace to grow in: but of such that are justified by the righteousness of Christ, have faith in him, and the seed of grace implanted in them. This is interpreted of the Messiah, by a Jewish writer (x); who observes, that in his days the priesthood shall return, and the rod of Aaron shall flourish; <p>and abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth; alluding, no doubt, to the name of Solomon, which signifies peace; and to that peace and prosperity which were enjoyed under his reign, and was a shadow of what would be in the times of Christ: universal peace, in a temporal sense, was in the times of Augustus, in which Christ was born, and in whose reign the temple of Janus was shut, a sure sign of peace (y). Spiritual peace was made with God by his blood, and all things were reconciled by him, whether in heaven or in earth; Jew and Gentile were made both one, and reconciled in one body; and abundance of spiritual peace is enjoyed by those that believe in Christ: they are kept in perfect peace, and filled with it; and in the latter day there will be abundance of peace among the saints, There will be no disputes nor discord among them; no envying nor vexing one another; no animosities or contentions about religious matters; for they will then see eye to eye: and they will be at peace with the men of the world; there will be no more wars in the earth, nor bloodshed, nor persecution. And this shall endure till there is no moon, till there shall be no need of one; as there will not in the New Jerusalem state, in which there will be no night. <p>(x) Baal Hatiurim in Numb. fol. 169. 3.((y) Vell.

The petition itself, and even the position of the words, show that the king's son is present, and that he is king; God is implored to bestow upon him His &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., the rights or legal powers belonging to Him, the God of Israel, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, i.e., the official gift in order that he may exercise those rights in accordance with divine righteousness. After the supplicatory teen the futures which now follow, without the Waw apodoseos, are manifestly optatives. Mountains and hills describe synecdochically the whole land of which they are the high points visible afar off. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; is used in the sense of &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-8.htm">Ezekiel 17:8</a> : may &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; be the fruit which ripens upon every mountain and hill; universal prosperity satisfied and contented within itself. The predicate for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a> is to be taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>, just as, on the other hand, &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, "in or by righteousness," the fruit of which is indeed peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>), belongs also to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>; so that consequently both members supplement one another. The wish of the poet is this: By righteousness, may there in due season be such peaceful fruit adorning all the heights of the land. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>, however, always makes one feel as though a verb were wanting, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; suggested by Bttcher. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a> the wishes are continued in plain unfigurative language. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; in the signification to save, to obtain salvation for, has, as is frequently the case, a dative of the object. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; are those who are born to poverty, just like &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, one who is born a king. Those who are born to poverty are more or less regarded, by an unrighteous government, as having no rights. </body></html>
