The prayer is based on the justice and beneficence of his reign (“to him that hath shall be given”), in which the weak and poor find their lives safe from violence, and their property protected against fraud.

There were righteousness and peace at first in the administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at an end. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of the Messiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which were to have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far as his kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families, churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance of peace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cut down, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needs not the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Those that have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do good with it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever we ask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered to him: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall be feared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be praised. All nations shall call HIM blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/72.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth - The sufferer; the down-trodden; the oppressed.

They are not the conquests of arms, but the influences of humane and peaceful principles (compare Isa 9:7; 11:1-9; Zec 9:9, 10).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/72.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.<p>13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.<p>14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12</a><p>"For he shall deliver the needy." Here is an excellent reason for man's submission to the Lord Christ; it is not because they dread his overwhelming power, but because they are won over by his just and condescending rule. Who would not fear so good a Prince, who makes the needy his peculiar care, and pledges himself to be their deliverer in times of need? "When he crieth." He permits them to be so needy as to be driven to cry bitterly for help, but then he hears them, and comes to their aid. A child's cry touches a father's heart, and our King is the Father of his people. If we can do no more than cry it will bring omnipotence to our aid. A cry is the native language of a spiritually needy soul; it has done with fine phrases and long orations, and it takes to sobs and moans; and so, indeed, it grasps the most potent of all weapons, for heaven always yields to such artillery. "The poor also, and him that hath no helper." The proverb says, "God helps those that help themselves;" but it is yet more true that Jesus helps those who cannot help themselves, nor find help in others. All helpless ones are under the especial care of Zion's compassionate King; let them hasten to put themselves in fellowship with him. Let them look to him, for he is looking for them.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-13.htm">Psalm 72:13</a><p>"He shall spare the poor and needy." His pity shall be manifested to them; he will not allow their trials to overwhelm them; his rod of correction shall fall lightly; he will be sparing of his rebukes, and not sparing in his consolations. "And shall save the souls of the needy." His is the dominion of souls, a spiritual and not a worldly empire; and the needy, that is to say, the consciously unworthy and weak, shall find that he will give them his salvation. Jesus calls not the righteous, but sinners to repentance. He does not attempt the superfluous work of aiding proud Pharisees to air their vanity; but he is careful of poor Publicans whose eyes dare not look up to heaven by reason of their sense of sin. We ought to be anxious to be among these needy ones whom the Great King so highly favours.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-14.htm">Psalm 72:14</a><p>"He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence." These two things are the weapons with which the poor are assailed: both law and no law are employed to fleece them. The fox and the lion are combined against Christ's lambs, but the Shepherd will defeat them, and rescue the defenceless from their teeth. A soul hunted by the temptations of Satanic craft, and the insinuations of diabolical malice, will do well to fly to the throne of Jesus for shelter. "And precious shall their blood be in his sight." He will not throw away his subjects in needless wars as tyrants have done, but will take every means for preserving the humblest of them. Conquerors have reckoned thousands of lives as small items; they have reddened fields with gore, as if blood were water, and flesh but manure for harvests; but Jesus, though he gave his own blood, is very chary of the blood of his servants, and if they must die for him as martyrs, he loves their memory, and counts their lives as his precious things. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/72.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The fame of his just and merciful government shall induce multitudes either to put themselves under him, or to show great respect and reverence to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/72.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth,.... Such as are not only in want, but are sensible of it, see their need of Christ and his righteousness, and salvation by him, and cry to him for the same, under a sense of their misery and danger; these he delivers out of all their troubles, and out of the hands of all their enemies, and supplies all their need; <p>the poor also; the poor in spirit; who acknowledge their spiritual poverty, and apply to him for the true riches; to these he gives gold tried in the fire, that they may be rich; he gives them grace here, and glory hereafter; <p>and him that hath no helper; that is in an helpless condition; can neither help himself, nor can any creature, angel or man, give him any help: but this being laid on Christ, and found in him, is given to him, whereby he is delivered out of a miserable state into a very comfortable and happy one; and such humane, kind, and tender regard to the needy, poor, and helpless, in this great King spoken of, is what engages to a cheerful subjection to him, and worship and reverence of him; more of which is expressed in the following verses, as the reason of the great esteem he should be had in. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/72.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/72.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">For he shall deliver</span>] His claim to this universal homage rests not on the strength of his armies but on the justice and mercifulness of his rule.

The first two periphrastic expressions for unlimited time recur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>., a Psalm composed after the time of Solomon; cf. the unfigurative expression in Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the Temple in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-40.htm">1 Kings 8:40</a>. The continuance of the kingship, from the operation of which such continuance of the fear of God is expected, is not asserted until <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>. It is capricious to refer the language of address in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a> to the king (as Hupfeld and Hitzig do), who is not directly addressed either in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>, or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>, or anywhere in the Psalm. With respect to God the desire is expressed that the righteous and benign rule of the king may result in the extension of the fear of God from generation to generation into endless ages. The poet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a> delights in a heaping up of synonyms in order to give intensity to the expression of the thoughts, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>; the last two expressions stand side by side one another without any bond of connection as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>. &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;, Arab. rbb, densum, spissum esse, and then, starting from this signification, sometimes multum and sometimes magnum esse) is the shower of rain pouring down in drops that are close together; nor is &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1507; a synonym of &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;, but (formed from &#1494;&#1512;&#1507;, Arab. d&#817;rf, to flow, by means of a rare reduplication of the first two letters of the root, Ew. 157, d) properly the water running from a roof (cf. B. Joma 87a: "when the maid above poured out water, &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497; &#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1488; came upon his head"). &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;, however, is not the meadow-shearing, equivalent to a shorn, mown meadow, any more than &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, Arabic g&#769;izza, signifies a shorn hide, but, on the contrary, a hide with the wool or feathers (e.g., ostrich feathers) still upon it, rather a meadow, i.e., grassy plain, that is intended to be mown. The closing word &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (accus. loci as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-15.htm">Psalm 147:15</a>) unites itself with the opening word &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;: descendat in terram. In his last words (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a>) David had compared the effects of the dominion of his successor, whom he beheld as by vision, to the fertilizing effects of the sun and of the rain upon the earth. The idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a> is that Solomon's rule may prove itself thus beneficial for the country. The figure of the rain in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a> gives birth to another: under his rule may the righteous blossom (expanding himself unhindered and under the most favourable circumsntaces), and (may there arise) salvation in all fulness &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;, until there is no more moon (cf. the similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>). To this desire for the uninterrupted prosperity and happiness of the righteous under the reign of this king succeeds the desire for an unlimited extension of his dominion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>. The sea (the Mediterranean) and the river (the Euphrates) are geographically defined points of issue, whence the definition of boundary is extended into the unbounded. Solomon even at his accession ruled over all kingdoms from the Euphrates as far as the borders of Egypt; the wishes expressed here are of wider compass, and Zechariah repeats them predictively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-10.htm">Psalm 9:10</a>) with reference to the King Messiah. </body></html>
