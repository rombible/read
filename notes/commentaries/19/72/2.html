There were righteousness and peace at first in the administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at an end. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of the Messiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which were to have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far as his kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families, churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance of peace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ's kingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cut down, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. His gospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needs not the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Those that have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do good with it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever we ask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered to him: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall be feared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be praised. All nations shall call HIM blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/72.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall judge thy people with righteousness - On this verse see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3-4</a>.

Or, "so shall he judge"; or, "that he may judge" (n), as the Syriac and Arabic versions; having the judgments and righteousness of God given him, he will be thereby qualified to judge the people of God; such as are so, not by creation, but by special grace; his chosen and covenant people, the redeemed and purchased people of God, and who in the effectual calling appear to be so, and are made his willing people. These Christ judges, rules, and governs, protects and defends, in a righteous manner; pleads their cause, vindicates their right, and avenges them on their enemies, as well as justifies them with his own righteousness; <p>and thy poor with judgment; justice and equity. Such who are literally poor, and are the Lord's poor, whom he has chosen, and makes rich in faith, and heirs of a kingdom; and with whom Christ, when here on earth, was chiefly concerned, and now is; and not with the great men and rulers of the earth: or such who are poor in spirit, sensible of their spiritual poverty; that find themselves hungry and thirsty, and destitute of righteousness, and without money, or anything to procure either. Or, "thine afflicted ones" (o); such as are distressed in body or mind, with respect to things temporal or spiritual; oppressed by sin, Satan, and the world, These Christ regards, and administers justice to in his own time and way; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>. <p>(n) "ut jus dicat", Tigurine version; so Ainsworth.

Without <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-19.htm">Psalm 71:19-21</a> being subordinate to &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a>, &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1514;&#1498; is coupled by close connection with &#1489;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-19.htm">Psalm 71:19</a> is an independent clause; and &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; takes the place of the predicate: the righteousness of God exceeds all bounds, is infinite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-11.htm">Psalm 57:11</a>). The cry &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; &#1502;&#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-10.htm">Psalm 35:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-6.htm">Jeremiah 10:6</a>, refers back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>. According to the Chethb, the range of the poet's vision widens in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a> from the proofs of the strength and righteousness of God which he has experienced in his own case to those which he has experienced in common with others in the history of his own nation. The Ker (cf. on the other hand <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-7.htm">Psalm 85:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a>) rests upon a failing to discern how the experiences of the writer are interwoven with those of the nation. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; in both instances supplies the corresponding adverbial notion to the principal verb, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-7.htm">Psalm 85:7</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;, prop. a rumbling, commonly used of a deep heaving of waters, here signifies an abyss.

The past and future are clearly distinguished in the sequence of the tenses. When God shall again raise His people out of the depth of the present catastrophe, then will He also magnify the &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; of the poet, i.e., in the dignity of his office, by most brilliantly vindicating him in the face of his foes, and will once more (&#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, fut. Niph. like &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; ekil .h above) comfort him. He on his part will also (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-14.htm">Job 40:14</a>) be grateful for this national restoration and this personal vindication: he will praise God, will praise His truth, i.e., His fidelity to His promises. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1489;&#1500; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1489;&#1500; sounds more circumstantial than in the old poetry.
