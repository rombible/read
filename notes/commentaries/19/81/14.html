He terms them <span class="ital">haters of the Lord, </span>partly because they hated the Israelites for God’s sake, and on account of the singularity of their worship, as the heathen often declared; and partly to show the close union and solemn league and covenant which were between God and them, by virtue of which God had declared he would account their friends to be his friends, and their enemies to be his enemies. <span class="ital">But their time — </span>That is, Israel’s time, meaning, either, 1st, Their <span class="ital">happy </span>time, <span class="ital">life </span>being often put for a happy life or state; or, rather, 2d, The duration of their commonwealth; <span class="ital">should have endured for ever </span>— Should have lasted for a long time; whereas now their latter and doleful end is hastening toward them. It may be proper to observe here the original expression, rendered, <span class="ital">should have submitted themselves to him, </span>is, <span class="greekheb">יכחשׁו לו</span>, <span class="ital">jecachashu lo, </span>which, as we have more than once had occasion to observe, signifies, <span class="ital">should have lied unto him, </span>that is, <span class="ital">spoken fair, fawned, </span>and pretended great respect to the Jewish people and their God, though in reality they hated them both. In this sense the words are understood by Bishop Patrick, whose paraphrase upon the verse is well worth transcribing. “All that maligned their prosperity,” (the prosperity of Israel,) “and set themselves against the design of the Lord, to make them victorious over their enemies, should have been so daunted, that they should have dissembled their inward hatred, and been forced, at least, to counterfeit submission; but his people should have seen blessed days, and have enjoyed a substantial and durable happiness without any interruption.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/81.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>81:8-16 We cannot look for too little from the creature, nor too much from the Creator. We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. All the wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People are not religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author of their sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and the counsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must be upon themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. What enemies sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubles long, and our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith and obedience, do Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things, which the pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth. Christ is the Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and his promises are as honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as their Lord and Master, must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/81.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I should soon have subdued their enemies - This is one of the consequences which, it is said, would have followed if they had been obedient to the laws of God. The phrase rendered soon means literally like a little; that is, as we might say, in a little, to wit, in a little time. The word rendered subdued means to bow down; to be curved or bent; and the idea is, that he would have caused them to bow down, to wit, by submission before them.

It begins, as one would expect in a Passover speech, with a reference to the &#1505;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-4.htm">Exodus 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>.), and to the duwd, the task-basket for the transport of the clay and of the bricks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-7.htm">Exodus 5:7</a>.).<p>(Note: In the Papyrus Leydensis i. 346 the Israelites are called the "Aperiu (&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;), who dragged along the stones for the great watch-tower of the city of Rameses," and in the Pap. Leyd. i. 349, according to Lauth, the "Aperiu, who dragged along the stones for the storehouse of the city of Rameses.")<p>Out of such distress did He free the poor people who cried for deliverance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>); He answered them &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1512;&#1506;&#1501;, i.e., not (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>): affording them protection against the storm, but (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-17.htm">Psalm 77:17</a>.): out of the thunder-clouds in which He at the same time revealed and veiled Himself, casting down the enemies of Israel with His lightnings, which is intended to refer pre-eminently to the passage through the Red Sea (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a>); and He proved them (&#1488;&#1489;&#1495;&#1504;&#1498;, with o&#774; contracted from o&#772;, cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-6.htm">Job 35:6</a>) at the waters of Merbah, viz., whether they would trust Him further on after such glorious tokens of His power and loving-kindness. The name "Waters of Mer&#305;&#770;bah," which properly is borne only by Mer&#305;&#770;bath Kadesh, the place of the giving of water in the fortieth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>), is here transferred to the place of the giving of water in the first year, which was named Massah u-Mer&#305;&#770;bah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>), as the remembrances of these two miracles, which took place under similar circumstances, in general blend together (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>.). It is not now said that Israel did not act in response to the expectation of God, who had son wondrously verified Himself; the music, as Seal imports, here rises, and makes a long and forcible pause in what is being said. What now follows further, are, as the further progress of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> shows, the words of God addressed to the Israel of the desert, which at the same time with its faithfulness are brought to the remembrance of the Israel of the present. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, to bear testimony that concerns him against any one. &#1488;&#1501; (according to the sense, o si, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>, which is in many ways akin to this Psalm) properly opens a searching question which wishes that the thing asked may come about (whether thou wilt indeed give me a willing hearing?!). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-10.htm">Psalm 81:10</a> the key-note of the revelation of the Law from Sinai is struck: the fundamental command which opens the decalogue demanded fidelity to Jahve and forbade idol-worship as the sin of sins. &#1488;&#1500; &#1494;&#1512; is an idol in opposition to the God of Israel as the true God; and &#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, a strange god in opposition to the true God as the God of Israel. To this one God Israel ought to yield itself all the more undividedly and heartily as it was more manifestly indebted entirely to Him, who in His condescension had chosen it, and in His wonder-working might had redeemed it (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1498;, part.
