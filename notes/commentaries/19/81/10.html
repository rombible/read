We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. All the wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People are not religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author of their sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and the counsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must be upon themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. What enemies sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubles long, and our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith and obedience, do Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things, which the pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth. Christ is the Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and his promises are as honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as their Lord and Master, must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/81.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am the Lord thy God ... - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>. The meaning is, "I am Yahweh, that God; the God to be worshipped and honored by thee; I only am thy God, and no other god is to be recognized or acknowledged by thee." The foundation of the claim to exclusive service and devotion is here laid in the fact that he had brought them out of the land of Egypt. Literally, had caused them to ascend, or go up from that land. The claim thus asserted seems to be twofold:<p>(a) that in doing this, he had shown that he was God, or that he had performed a work which none but God could perform, and had thus shown his existence and power; and<p>(b) that by this he had brought them under special obligations to himself, inasmuch as they owed all that they had - their national existence and liberty - entirely to him.<p>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it - Possibly an allusion to young birds, when fed by the parent-bird. The meaning here is, "I can amply supply all your needs. You need not go to other gods - the gods of other lands - as if there were any deficiency in my power or resources; as if I were not able to meet your necessities. All your needs I can meet. Ask what you need - what you will; come to me and make any request with reference to yourselves as individuals or as a nation - to this life or the life to come - and you will find in me all abundant supply for all your needs, and a willingness to bless you commensurate with my resources." What is here said of the Hebrews may be said of the people of God at all times. There is not a want of our nature - of our bodies or our souls; a want pertaining to this life or the life to come - to ourselves, to our families, to our friends, to the church, or to our country - which God is not able to meet; and there is not a real necessity in any of these respects which he is not willing to meet. Why, then, should his people ever turn for happiness to the "weak and beggarly elements of the world" (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>), as if God could not satisfy them? Why should they seek for happiness in vain amusements, or in sensual pleasures, as if God could not, or would not, supply the real needs of their souls? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/81.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The true Jehovah, the Being of beings, in whom all live and move and have their beings, the covenant God of his people; and is a reason why they should hear him, and worship him, and no other: <p>which brought thee out of the land of Egypt; this, with what goes before, is the preface to the ten commands, the first and principal of which is urged in the preceding verse; and this is another reason why the Lord God should be had and worshipped, and not a strange god; and redemption from worse than Egyptian bondage, from the bondage of sin, Satan, and the law, and a deliverance from worse than Egyptian darkness, and from a state of wickedness and impiety, should lay under greater obligations still to serve the Lord, and worship him only; who adds, as a further reason for it, <p>open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it; which may be understood of opening the mouth either in prayer or in praise: to open the mouth wide in prayer is to pray with great freedom, to pour out the soul to God, lay open its whole case, and tell him all his mind and wants; to pray with great boldness, and with much importunity and fervency, and in full assurance of faith, pleading with great strength the promises of God, and asking in faith for much, according to them; and God may be said to fill this wide mouth of faith in prayer, when he grants the desires of the heart, gives his people what they will, even very largely and abundantly, yea, more than they can ask or think: to open the mouth wide in praise is to be abundantly thankful for mercies received; and when persons are so, the Lord fills them with more abundant matter for praise and thanksgiving; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-8.htm">Psalm 71:8</a>, or this may be interpreted of opening the mouth wide in expressions of desire after spiritual food, hungering and thirsting after spiritual things, when the Lord fills or satisfies the mouths of his people with good things, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>, with the sincere milk of the word which they desire, and with the ordinances, the breasts of consolation they long for, and so satisfies them with the goodness and fatness of his house, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/64-4.htm">Psalm 64:4</a>, the metaphor seems to be taken from the young of birds, which open their mouths, and are filled by the old ones: the Targum is, <p>"open thy mouth to the words of the law, and I will fill it with every good thing.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/81.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</span><p>(i) God accuses their incredulity, because they did not open their mouths to receive God's benefits in such abundance as he pours them out.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/81.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

God's gifts, both temporal and spiritual, are proportioned to our eager longing for them. As Christ could not do his miracles in one place because of their unbelief (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5, 6</a>), so God cannot give lavishly unless we desire largely. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/81.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/81-4.htm">Psalm 81:4-5</a> now tell whence the feast which is to be met with singing and music has acquired such a high significance: it is a divine institution coming from the time of the redemption by the hand of Moses. It is called &#1495;&#1511; as being a legally sanctioned decree, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; as being a lawfully binding appointment, and &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; as being a positive declaration of the divine will. The &#1500; in &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; characterizes Israel as the receiver, in &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; the God of Israel as the owner, i.e., Author and Lawgiver. By &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493; the establishing of the statute is dated back to the time of the Exodus; but the statement of the time of its being established, "when He went out over the land of Egypt," cannot be understood of the exodus of the people out of Egypt, natural as this may be here, where Israel has just been called &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507; (pathetic for &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507;), by a comparison with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>, where Joseph is spoken of in the same words. For this expression does not describe the going forth out of a country, perhaps in the sight of its inhabitants, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a> (Hengstenberg), but the going out over a country. Elohim is the subject, and &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; is to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4</a> (Kimchi, De Dieu, Dathe, Rosenmller, and others): when He went out for judgment over the land of Egypt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>). This statement of the time of itself at once decides the reference of the Psalm to the Passover, which commemorates the sparing of Israel at that time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-27.htm">Exodus 12:27</a>), and which was instituted on that very night of judgment. The accentuation divides the verse correctly. According to this, &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is not a relative clause to &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;: where I heard a language that I understood not (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-1.htm">Psalm 114:1</a>). Certainly &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1492;, "to understand a language," is an expression that is in itself not inadmissible (cf. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, to understand writing, to be able to read, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>.), the selection of which instead of the more customary phrase &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-19.htm">Isaiah 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>) might be easily intelligible here beside &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;; but the omission of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;) is harsh, the thought it here purposeless, and excluded with our way of taking &#1489;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;. From the speech of God that follows it is evident that the clause is intended to serve as an introduction of this divine speech, whether it now be rendered sermonem quem non novi (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-44.htm">Psalm 18:44</a>, populus quem non novi), or alicujus, quem non novi (Ges. 123, rem. 1), both of which are admissible. It is not in some way an introduction to the following speech of God as one which it has been suddenly given to the psalmist to hear: "An unknown language, or the language of one unknown, do I hear?" Thus Dderlein explains it: Subitanea et digna poetico impetu digressio, cum vates sese divino adflatu subito perculsum sentit et oraculum audire sibi persuadet; and in the same way De Wette, Olshausen, Hupfeld, and others. But the oracle of God cannot appear so strange to the Israelitish poet and seer as the spirit-voice to Eliphaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>); and moreover &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; after the foregoing historical predicates has the presumption of the imperfect signification in its favour. Thus, then, it will have to be interpreted according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-2.htm">Exodus 6:2</a>. It was the language of a known, but still also unknown God, which Israel heard in the redemption of that period. It was the God who had been made manifest as &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; only, so to speak, by way of prelude hitherto, who now appeared at this juncture of the patriarchal history, which had been all along kept in view, in the marvellous and new light of the judgment which was executed upon Egypt, and of the protection, redemption, and election of Israel, as being One hitherto unknown, as the history of salvation actually then, having arrived at Sinai, receives an entirely new form, inasmuch as from this time onwards the congregation or church is a nation, and Jahve the King of a nation, and the bond of union between them a national law educating it for the real, vital salvation that is to come. The words of Jahve that follow are now not the words heard then in the time of the Exodus. The remembrance of the words heard forms only a transition to those that now make themselves heard. For when the poet remembers the language which He who reveals Himself in a manner never before seen and heard of spoke to His people at that time, the Ever-living One Himself, who is yesterday and to-day the same One, speaks in order to remind His people of what He was to them then, and of what He spake to them then. </body></html>
