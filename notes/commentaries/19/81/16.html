We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. All the wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People are not religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author of their sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and the counsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must be upon themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. What enemies sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubles long, and our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith and obedience, do Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things, which the pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth. Christ is the Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and his promises are as honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as their Lord and Master, must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/81.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He should have fed them also - He would have given them prosperity, and their land would have produced abundantly of the necessities - even of the luxuries - of life.

Much of that which was obtained was wild honey, deposited by the bees in the hollows of trees, and as it would seem in the caverns of the rocks. Much of it was gathered also from rocky regions, and this was regarded as the most delicate and valuable. I do not know the cause of this, nor why honey in high and rocky countries should be more pure and white than that obtained from other places; but the whitest and the most pure and delicate honey that I have ever seen I found at Chamouni in Switzerland. Dr. Thomson (land and the Book, vol. ii. p. 362) says of the rocky region in the vicinity of Timnath, that "bees were so abundant in a wood at no great distance from this spot that the honey dropped down from the trees on the ground;" and that "he explored densely-wooded gorges in Hermon and in Southern Lebanon where wild bees are still found, both in trees and in the clefts of the rocks."<p>The meaning here is plain, that, if Israel had been obedient to God, he would have blessed them with abundance - with the richest and most coveted productions of the field. Pure religion - obedience to God - morality - temperance, purity, honesty, and industry, such as religion requires - are always eminently favorable to individual and national prosperity; and if a man or a nation desired to be most prospered, most successful in the lawful and proper objects of individual or national existence, and most happy, nothing would tend more to conduce to it than those virtues which piety enjoins and cultivates. Individuals and nations, even in respect to temporal prosperity, are most unwise, as well as most wicked, when they disregard the laws of God, and turn away from the precepts and the spirit of religion. It is true of nations, as it is of individuals, that "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/81.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-16.

Aben Ezra interprets this of the water which flowed out of the rock at Horeb, which was sweeter than honey; but the former sense is best: the rock spiritually and mystically designs Christ, the Rock of salvation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, the honey out of the rock, the fulness of grace in him, and the blessings of it, the sure mercies of David, and the precious promises of the everlasting covenant; and the Gospel, which is sweeter than the honey or the honeycomb; and with these such are filled and satisfied, who hearken to Christ, and walk in his ways; for, as the whole of what is here said shows what Israel lost by disobedience, it clearly suggests what such enjoy who hear and obey. <p>(y)  "ex adipe frumenti", V.

Leyd. i. 349, according to Lauth, the "Aperiu, who dragged along the stones for the storehouse of the city of Rameses.")<p>Out of such distress did He free the poor people who cried for deliverance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>); He answered them &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1512; &#1512;&#1506;&#1501;, i.e., not (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>): affording them protection against the storm, but (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-17.htm">Psalm 77:17</a>.): out of the thunder-clouds in which He at the same time revealed and veiled Himself, casting down the enemies of Israel with His lightnings, which is intended to refer pre-eminently to the passage through the Red Sea (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a>); and He proved them (&#1488;&#1489;&#1495;&#1504;&#1498;, with o&#774; contracted from o&#772;, cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-6.htm">Job 35:6</a>) at the waters of Merbah, viz., whether they would trust Him further on after such glorious tokens of His power and loving-kindness. The name "Waters of Mer&#305;&#770;bah," which properly is borne only by Mer&#305;&#770;bath Kadesh, the place of the giving of water in the fortieth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>), is here transferred to the place of the giving of water in the first year, which was named Massah u-Mer&#305;&#770;bah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>), as the remembrances of these two miracles, which took place under similar circumstances, in general blend together (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>.). It is not now said that Israel did not act in response to the expectation of God, who had son wondrously verified Himself; the music, as Seal imports, here rises, and makes a long and forcible pause in what is being said. What now follows further, are, as the further progress of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> shows, the words of God addressed to the Israel of the desert, which at the same time with its faithfulness are brought to the remembrance of the Israel of the present. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, to bear testimony that concerns him against any one. &#1488;&#1501; (according to the sense, o si, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>, which is in many ways akin to this Psalm) properly opens a searching question which wishes that the thing asked may come about (whether thou wilt indeed give me a willing hearing?!). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-10.htm">Psalm 81:10</a> the key-note of the revelation of the Law from Sinai is struck: the fundamental command which opens the decalogue demanded fidelity to Jahve and forbade idol-worship as the sin of sins. &#1488;&#1500; &#1494;&#1512; is an idol in opposition to the God of Israel as the true God; and &#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, a strange god in opposition to the true God as the God of Israel. To this one God Israel ought to yield itself all the more undividedly and heartily as it was more manifestly indebted entirely to Him, who in His condescension had chosen it, and in His wonder-working might had redeemed it (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1498;, part.
