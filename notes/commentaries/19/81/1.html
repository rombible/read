What God had done on Israel's behalf, was kept in remembrance by public solemnities. To make a deliverance appear more gracious, more glorious, it is good to observe all that makes the trouble we are delivered from appear more grievous. We ought never to forget the base and ruinous drudgery to which Satan, our oppressor, brought us. But when, in distress of conscience, we are led to cry for deliverance, the Lord answers our prayers, and sets us at liberty. Convictions of sin, and trials by affliction, prove his regard to his people. If the Jews, on their solemn feast-days, were thus to call to mind their redemption out of Egypt, much more ought we, on the Christian sabbath, to call to mind a more glorious redemption, wrought out for us by our Lord Jesus Christ, from worse bondage.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/81.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sing aloud unto God our strength - The strength and support of the nation; he from whom the nation has derived all its power.

"Aloud." For the heartiest praise is due to our good Lord. His acts of love to us speak more loudly than any of our words of gratitude can do. No dulness should ever stupify our psalmody, or half-heartedness cause it to limp along. Sing aloud, ye debtors to sovereign grace, your hearts are profoundly grateful: let your voices express your thankfulness. "Unto God our strength." The Lord was the strength of his people in delivering them out of Egypt with a high hand, and also in sustaining them in the wilderness, placing them in Canaan, preserving them from their foes, and giving them victory. To whom do men give honour but to those upon whom they rely, therefore let us sing aloud unto our God, who is our strength and our song. "Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob." The God of the nation, the God of their father Jacob, was extolled in gladsome music by the Israelitish people: let no Christian be silent, or slack in praise, for this God is our God. It is to be regretted that the niceties of modern singing frighten our congregations from joining lustily in the hymns. For our part we delight in full bursts of praise, and had rather discover the ruggedness of a want of musical training than miss the heartiness of universal congregational song. The gentility which lisps the tune in wellbred whispers, or leaves the singing altogether to the choir, is very like a mockery of worship. The gods of Greece and Rome may be worshipped well enough with classical music, but Jehovah can only be adored with the heart, and that music is the best for his service which gives the heart most play.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-2.htm">Psalm 81:2</a><p>"Take a psalm." Select a sacred song, and then raise it with your hearty voices. "And bring hither the timbrel." Beat on your tambourines, ye damsels, let the sound be loud and inspiriting. "Sound the trumpets, beat the drums." God is not to be served with misery but with mirthful music, sound ye then the loud timbrel, as of old ye smote it by "Egypt's dark sea." "The pleasant harp with the psaltery." The timbrel for sound, must be joined by the harp for sweetness, and this by other stringed instruments for variety. Let the full compass of music be holiness unto the Lord.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a><p>"Blow up the trumpet in the new moon." Announce the sacred month, the beginning of months, when the Lord brought his people out of the house of bondage. Clear and shrill let the summons be which calls all Israel to adore the Redeeming Lord. "In the time appointed, on our solemn feast day." Obedience is to direct our worship, not whim and sentiment: God's appointment gives a solemnity to rites and times which no ceremonial pomp or hierarchical ordinance could confer. The Jews not only observed the ordained month, but that part of the month which had been divinely set apart. The Lord's people in the olden time welcomed the times appointed for worship; let us feel the same exultation, and never speak of the Sabbath as though it could be other than "a delight" and "honourable." Those who plead this passage as authority for their man-appointed feasts and fasts must be moonstruck. We will keep such feasts as the Lord appoints, but not those which Rome or Canterbury may ordain.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-4.htm">Psalm 81:4</a><p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm seems to have been made for the use of the church in solemn feasts; particularly either upon every first day of the month, or upon the first day of the seventh mouth, which was celebrated with more solemn blast of trumpets, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall you have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.">Leviticus 23:24</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm" title="And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets to you.">Numbers 29:1</a></span>; because that month was more sacred than others by reason of the concurrence of divers religious solemnities in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gittith; </span> of which title <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm" title="O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth! who have set your glory above the heavens.">Psalm 8:1</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">An exhortation to a solemn praising of God</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/81-1.htm" title="Sing aloud to God our strength: make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob....">Psalm 81:1-3</a></span>; which he requireth for his manifold mercies and deliverances, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/81-4.htm" title="For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob....">Psalm 81:4-7</a></span>; and, exhorting to obedience, and the worshipping of him the true God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/81-8.htm" title="Hear, O my people, and I will testify to you: O Israel, if you will listen to me;...">Psalm 81:8-10</a></span>, complaineth of their disobedience, which tended to their own hurt and affliction, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/81-11.htm" title="But my people would not listen to my voice; and Israel would none of me....">Psalm 81:11-16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Our strength; who is all our refuge and safeguard against all our enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/81.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Sing aloud unto God our strength,....

Rabba, ch. 44, with reference to this passage, says: "When husbandmen seek to improve a vine, what do they do? They root (&#1506;&#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;) it out of its place and plant (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;) it in another." And Levit. Rabba, ch. 36, says: "As one does not plant a vine in a place where there are great, rough stones, but examines the ground and then plants it, so didst Thou drive out peoples and didst plant it," etc.)<p>Here God made His vine a way and a place (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, to clear, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, to turn, turn aside, Arabic fanija, to disappear, pass away; root &#1508;&#1503;, to urge forward), and after He had secured to it a free soil and unchecked possibility of extension, it (the vine) rooted its roots, i.e., struck them ever deeper and wider, and filled the earth round about (cf. the antitype in the final days, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>). The Israelitish kingdom of God extended itself on every side in accordance with the promise. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>, and vegetable &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, a shoot) also has the vine as its subject, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-11.htm">Psalm 80:11-12</a> state this in a continued allegory, by the "mountains" pointing to the southern boundary, by the "cedars" to the northern, by the "sea" to the western, and by the "river" (Euphrates) to the eastern boundary of the country (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a> and other passages). &#1510;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; and &#1506;&#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492; are accusatives of the so-called more remote object (Ges. 143, 1). &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; is a cutting  equals  a branch; &#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1514;, a (vegetable) sucker  equals  a young, tender shoot; &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;, the cedars of Lebanon as being living monuments of the creative might of God. The allegory exceeds the measure of the reality of nature, inasmuch as this is obliged to be extended according to the reality of that which is typified and historical. But how unlike to the former times is the present! The poet asks "wherefore?" for the present state of things is a riddle to him. The surroundings of the vine are torn down; all who come in contact with it pluck it (&#1488;&#1512;&#1492;, to pick off, pluck off, Talmudic of the gathering of figs); the boar out of the wood (&#1502;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512; with &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;, Ajin)<p>(Note: According to Kiddushin, 30a, because this Ajin is the middle letter of the Psalter as the Waw of &#1490;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-42.htm">Leviticus 11:42</a>, is the middle letter of the Tra. One would hardly like to be at the pains of proving the correctness of this statement; nevertheless in the seventeenth century there lived one Laymarius, a clergyman, who was not afraid of this trouble, and found the calculations of the Masora (e.g., that &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492; occurs 222 times) in part inaccurate; vid., Monatliche Unterredungen, 1691, S. 467, and besides, Geiger, Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel, S. 258f.))<p>cuts it off (&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1501;, formed out of &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1501;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1501;<p>(Note: Saadia appropriately renders it Arab. yqrd&#803;ha&#770;, by referring, as does Dunash also, to the Talmudic &#1511;&#1512;&#1505;&#1501;, which occurs of ants, like Arab. qrd&#803;, of rodents.

Without doubt the poet associates a distinct nation with the wild boar in his mind; for animals are also in other instances the emblems of nations, as e.g., the leviathan, the water-serpent, the behemoth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>), and flies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>) are emblems of Egypt.

Accordingly the Ajin suspensum might also be the result of a later inserted correction, for there is a Phoenician inscription that has &#1497;&#1512; (wood, forest); vid., Levy, Phnizisches Wrterbuch, S. 22.)<p>But the alternation of &#1506;&#1500; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>, and Arab. jn &#8219;la&#770;, to cover over) with the accusative of the object makes it more natural to derive &#1499;&#1504;&#1492;, not from &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, but from &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503; Arab. kanna  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;, to cover, conceal, protect (whence Arab. kinn, a covering, shelter, hiding-place): and protect him whom...or: protect what Thy right hand has planted. The pointing certainly seems to take &#1499;&#1504;&#1492; as the feminine of &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; (lxx, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-7.htm">Daniel 11:7</a>, &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;); for an imperat. paragog. Kal of the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; does not occur elsewhere, although it might have been regarded by the punctuists as possible from the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, volve, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-22.htm">Psalm 119:22</a>. If it is regarded as impossible, then one might read &#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;. At any rate the word is imperative, as the following &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, eum quem, also shows, instead of which, if &#1499;&#1504;&#1492; were a substantive, one would expect to find a relative clause without &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a>. Moreover <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a> requires this, since &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; can only be used of visiting with punishment. And who then would the slip (branch) and the son of man be in distinction from the vine? If we take &#1489;&#1504;&#1492; as imperative, then, as one might expect, the vine and the son of man are both the people of God. The Targum renders <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a> thus: "and upon the King Messiah, whom Thou hast established for Thyself," after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>; but, as in the latter passage, it is not the Christ Himself, but the nation out of which He is to proceed, that is meant. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509; has the sense of firm appropriation, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a>, inasmuch as the notion of making fast passes over into that of laying firm hold of, of seizure. Rosenmller well renders it: quem adoptatum tot nexibus tibi adstrinxisti.<p>The figure of the vine, which rules all the language here, is also still continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; for the partt. fem. refer to &#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1503; ot refer, - the verb, however, may take the plural form, because those of Israel are this "vine," which combusta igne, succisa (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12</a>; Aramaic, be cut off, tear off, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-13.htm">Psalm 80:13</a> the Targum word for &#1488;&#1512;&#1492;; Arabic, ksh&#803;, to clear away, peel off), is just perishing, or hangs in danger of destruction (&#1497;&#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;) before the threatening of the wrathful countenance of God. The absence of anything to denote the subject, and the form of expression, which still keeps within the circle of the figure of the vine, forbid us to understand this <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a> of the extirpation of the foes. According to the sense &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; &#1506;&#1500;<p>(Note: The &#1514;&#1492;&#1497; has Gaja, like &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1470;&#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a>), &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1499;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>), and the like. This Gaja beside the Sheb (instead of beside the following vowel) belongs to the peculiarities of the metrical books, which in general, on account of their more melodious mode of delivery, have many such a Gaja beside Sheb, which does not occur in the prose books. Thus, e.g., &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; always have Gaja beside the Sheb when they have Rebia magnum without a conjunctive, probably because Rebia and Dech had such a fulness of tone that a first stroke fell even upon the Sheb-letters.)<p>coincides with the supplicatory &#1499;&#1504;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;. It is Israel that is called &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a>, as being the son whom Jahve has called into being in Egypt, and then called out of Egypt to Himself and solemnly declared to be His son on Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>), and who is now, with a play upon the name of Benjamin in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a>), called &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;, as being the people which Jahve has preferred before others, and has placed at His right hand<p>(Note: Pinsker punctuates thus: Let Thy hand be upon the man, Thy right hand upon the son of man, whom, etc.; but the impression that &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; and &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1498; coincide is so strong, that no one of the old interpreters (from the lxx and Targum onwards) has been able to free himself from it.)<p>continued...</body></html>
