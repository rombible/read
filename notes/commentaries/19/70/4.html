They have given the sufferer gall and vinegar; therefore their table, which was abundantly supplied, is to be turned into a snare to them, from which they shall not be able to escape, and that &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, in the very midst of their banqueting, whilst the table stands spread out before them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (collateral form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;) is the name given to them as being carnally secure; the word signifies the peaceable or secure in a good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>) and in a bad sense. Destruction is to overtake them suddenly, "when they say: Peace and safety" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). The lxx erroneously renders: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  equals  &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. The association of ideas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-24.htm">Psalm 69:24</a> is transparent. With their eyes they have feasted themselves upon the sufferer, and in the strength of their loins they have ill-treated him. These eyes with their bloodthirsty malignant looks are to grow blind. These loins full of defiant self-confidence are to shake (&#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1491;, imperat. Hiph. like &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>, from &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;, for which in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-7.htm">Ezekiel 29:7</a>, and perhaps also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-14.htm">Daniel 11:14</a>, we find &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;). Further: God is to pour out His wrath upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>), i.e., let loose against them the cosmical forces of destruction existing originally in His nature. &#1494;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; has the Dagesh in order to distinguish it in pronunciation from &#1494;&#1506;&#1502;&#1498;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-26.htm">Psalm 69:26</a> &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; (from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to encircle) is a designation of an encamping or dwelling-place (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;) taken from the circular encampments (Arabic s&#803;&#305;&#770;ra&#770;t, s&#803;ira&#770;t, and dwa&#770;r, dua&#770;r) of the nomads (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>). The laying waste and desolation of his own house is the most fearful of all misfortunes to the Semite (Job, note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>). The poet derives the justification of such fearful imprecations from the fact that they persecute him, who is besides smitten of God. God has smitten him on account of his sins, and that by having placed him in the midst of a time in which he must be consumed with zeal and solicitude for the house of God. The suffering decreed for him by God is therefore at one and the same time suffering as a chastisement and as a witnessing for God; and they heighten this suffering by every means in their power, not manifesting any pity for him or any indulgence, but imputing to him sins that he has not committed, and requiting him with deadly hatred for benefits for which they owed him thanks.<p>There are also some others, although but few, who share this martyrdom with him. The psalmist calls them, as he looks up to Jahve, &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, Thy fatally smitten ones; they are those to whom God has appointed that they should bear within themselves a pierced or wounded heart (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm">Psalm 109:22</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-18.htm">Jeremiah 8:18</a>) in the face of such a godless age. Of the deep grief (&#1488;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>) of these do they tell, viz., with self-righteous, self-blinded mockery (cf. the Talmudic phrase &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1489;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; or &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;, of evil report or slander). The lxx and Syriac render &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;): they add to the anguish; the Targum, Aquila, Symmachus, and Jerome follow the traditional text. Let God therefore, by the complete withdrawal of His grace, suffer them to fall from one sin into another - this is the meaning of the da culpam super culpam eorum - in order that accumulated judgment may correspond to the accumulated guilt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>). Let the entrance into God's righteousness, i.e., His justifying and sanctifying grace, be denied to them for ever. Let them be blotted out of &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>), that is to say, struck out of the list of the living, and that of the living in this present world; for it is only in the New Testament that we meet with the Book of Life as a list of the names of the heirs of the &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. According to the conception both of the Old and of the New Testament the &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; are the heirs of life. Therefore <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-29.htm">Psalm 69:29</a> wishes that they may not be written by the side of the righteous, who, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, "live," i.e., are preserved, by their faith. With &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; the poet contrasts himself, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-18.htm">Psalm 40:18</a>, with those deserving of execration. They are now on high, but in order to be brought low; he is miserable and full of poignant pain, but in order to be exalted; God's salvation will remove him from his enemies on to a height that is too steep for them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-2.htm">Psalm 59:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-14.htm">Psalm 91:14</a>). Then will he praise (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;) and magnify (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;) the Name of God with song and thankful confession. And such spiritual &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, such thank-offering of the heart, is more pleasing to God than an ox, a bullock, i.e., a young ox ( equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;, an ox-bullock, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a>, according to Ges. 113), one having horns and a cloven hoof (Ges. 53, 2). The attributives do not denote the rough material animal nature (Hengstenberg), but their legal qualifications for being sacrificed. &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; is the name for the young ox as not being under three years old (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-24.htm">1 Samuel 1:24</a>, lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;); &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; as belonging to the clean four-footed animals, viz., those that are cloven-footed and chew the cud, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>. Even the most stately, full-grown, clean animal that may be offered as a sacrifice stands in the sight of Jahve very far below the sacrifice of grateful praise coming from the heart.<p>When now the patient sufferers (&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;) united with the poet by community of affliction shall see how he offers the sacrifice of thankful confession, they will rejoice. &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is a hypothetical preterite; it is neither &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (perf. consec.), nor &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-42.htm">Psalm 107:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-19.htm">Job 22:19</a>). The declaration conveying information to be expected in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-33.htm">Psalm 69:33</a> after the Waw apodoseos changes into an apostrophe of the "seekers of Elohim:" their heart shall revive, for, as they have suffered in company with him who is now delivered, they shall now also refresh themselves with him. We are at once reminded of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27</a>, where this is as it were the exhortation of the entertainer at the thank-offering meal. It would be rash to read &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23</a>, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>, instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (Olshausen); the one object in that passage is here generalized: Jahve is attentive to the needy, and doth not despise His bound ones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>), but, on the contrary, He takes an interest in them and helps them. Starting from this proposition, which is the clear gain of that which has been experienced, the view of the poet widens into the prophetic prospect of the bringing back of Israel out of the Exile into the Land of Promise. In the face of this fact of redemption of the future he calls upon (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>) all created things to give praise to God, who will bring about the salvation of Zion, will build again the cities of Judah, and restore the land, freed from its desolation, to the young God-fearing generation, the children of the servants of God among the exiles. The feminine suffixes refer to &#1506;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a> Chethb). The tenor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a> is similar. If the Psalm were written by David, the closing turn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23</a> onwards might be more difficult of comprehension than <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>: If, however, it is by Jeremiah, then we do not need to persuade ourselves that it is to be understood not of restoration and re-peopling, but of continuance and completion (Hofmann and Kurtz). <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/54.htm">Jeremiah 54</a>ed to experience the catastrophe he foretold; but the nearer it came to the time, the more comforting were the words with which he predicted the termination of the Exile and the restoration of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a> shows us how natural to him, and to him in particular, was the distinction between Jerusalem and the cities of Judah. The predictions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-1.htm">Jeremiah 32:1</a>, which sound so in accord with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-36.htm">Psalm 69:36</a>., belong to the time of the second siege. Jerusalem was not yet fallen; the strong places of the land, however, already lay in ruins. </body></html>
