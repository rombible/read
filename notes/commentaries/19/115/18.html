Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/115.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But we will bless the Lord ... - While life lasts; now and ever onward. Our lives are spared; and while those lives shall be continued they shall be spent in praise. We will transmit the praise to future times; and when we are dead, the voice of praise shall be prolonged by those who come after us. It may be added here that we have now higher and clearer views of the grave and of the future world than the psalmist had, and that though it is certain that our voices of praise must be stilled by death, yet in another world we shall continue the work of praise in strains more lofty than here, and in a continuance of service that shall never end. The grave is, indeed, before us all; but so is also heaven, if we belong to those who truly fear the Lord, and who sincerely worship him through Christ Jesus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/115.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

The threefold division into Israel, the house of Aaron, and those who fear Jahve is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-2.htm">Psalm 118:2-4</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a> the "house of Levi" is further added to the house of Aaron. Those who fear Jahve, who also stand in the last passage, are probably the proselytes (in the Acts of the Apostles &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, or merely &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>(Note: The appellation &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; does not however occur, if we do not bring <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a> in here; but in Latin inscriptions in Orelli-Hentzen No. 2523, and in Auer in the Zeitschrift fr katholische Theologie 1852, S. 80, the proselyte (religionis Judaicae) is called metuens.))<p>at any rate these are included even if Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm">Psalm 115:9</a> is meant to signify the laity, for the notion of "those who fear Jahve" extends beyond Israel. The fact that the threefold refrain of the summons does not run, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>, our help and shield is He, is to be explained from its being an antiphonal song. In so far, however, as the Psalm supplicates God's protection and help in a campaign the declaration of confident hope, their help and shield is He, may, with Hitzig, be referred to the army that is gone or is going forth. It is the same voice which bids Israel to be of good courage and announces to the people the well-pleased acceptance of the sacrifice with the words "Jahve hath been mindful of us" (&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;, cf. &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), perhaps simultaneously with the presentation of the memorial portion (&#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;) of the meat-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-1.htm">Psalm 38:1</a>). The &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; placed at the head is particularized threefold, corresponding to the threefold summons. The special promise of blessing which is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-14.htm">Psalm 115:14</a> is an echo of <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-3.htm">2 Samuel 24:3</a>. The contracted future &#1497;&#1505;&#1507; we take in a consolatory sense; for as an optative it would be too isolated here. In spite of all oppression on the part of the heathen, God will make His people ever more numerous, more capable of offering resistance, and more awe-inspiring. </body></html>
