Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/115.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O house of Aaron ... - Ministers of religion; descendants of Aaron.

The family of the tribe of Levi, that was separated from the rest, to minister in the priest's office, to offer gifts and sacrifices for the people, and to bless them; and therefore ought to trust in the Lord, and set a good example to others: as ministers of the word should, who are intrusted with much by the Lord, and should trust in him for much; for every supply of gifts and grace; and the rather, as they are to be examples of faith to the people: and as all the saints under the Gospel dispensation are priests unto God, they should put their trust and confidence in the Lord; since their sacrifices cannot be acceptable and wellpleasing to God, without faith in him. <p>He is their help and their shield; the Lord is the help and shield of everyone of Aaron's family; of the priests under the law, and of ministers under the Gospel; and of all those who are kings and priests unto God; and therefore they should trust in him. This is repeated for the certainty of it, and for the particular application of it to Aaron's house. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/115.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{g}</span> O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he <i>is</i> their help and their shield.</span><p>(g) For they were appointed by God as instructors and teachers of faith and religion for others to follow.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/115.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord</span>.

Israel's God is in the heavens, and is therefore supramundane in nature and life, and the absolutely unlimited One, who is able to do all things with a freedom that is conditioned only by Himself: quod vult, valet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>  equals  <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-6.htm">Psalm 135:6</a>, Wisd. 12:18, and frequently). The carved gods (&#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, from &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;, cogn. &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, &#1511;&#1510;&#1489;) of the heathen, on the contrary, are dead images, which are devoid of all life, even of the sensuous life the outward organs of which are imagined upon them. It cannot be proved with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:16</a> that &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501; are equivalent to &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. They are either subjects which the Waw apodosis cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-24.htm">Genesis 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-24.htm">Proverbs 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>) renders prominent, or casus absoluti (Ges. &#1431;145, 2), since both verbs have the idols themselves as their subjects less on account of their gender (&#1497;&#1491; and &#1512;&#1490;&#1500; are feminine, but the Hebrew usage of genders is very free and not carried out uniformly) as in respect of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a>: with reference to their hands, etc. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; is the energetic future form, which goes over from &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; into &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, for &#1497;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;. It is said once again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a> that speech is wanting to them; for the other negations only deny life to them, this at the same time denies all personality. The author might know from his own experience how little was the distinction made by the heathen worship between the symbol and the thing symbolized. Accordingly the worship of idols seems to him, as to the later prophets, to be the extreme of self-stupefaction and of the destruction of human consciousness; and the final destiny of the worshippers of false gods, as he says in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/115-8.htm">Psalm 115:8</a>, is, that they become like to their idols, that is to say, being deprived of their consciousness, life, and existence, they come to nothing, like those their nothingnesses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>). This whole section of the Psalm is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/115-6.htm">Psalm 115:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-15.htm">Psalm 115:15</a>). </body></html>
