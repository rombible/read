Here the change of person suggests some musical arrangement. Apparently one part of the choir, or, it may be, one officiating priest, addressed successively the whole congregation with the charge, “trust in Jehovah,” and each time the full choir took up the refrain, “He is their helper and shield,” repeating to the priest the ground on which he urged confidence and loyalty.

Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith in him; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever found faithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied to the meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especially in spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness is large, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use. The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God: death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial and conflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we are gone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us to praise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the first and last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refresh our souls for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/115.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Israel, trust thou in the Lord - This exhortation is founded in a great measure on what had been just said in regard to idols. They had no power. There was no reason why they should be confided in. They could not help in the day of trouble; and as people need a god, and as the idols cannot be to them as gods, the exhortation is addressed to his people to trust him. He would be to them all that was implied in the name God; all that was wanted in a God.<p>He is their help - The help of those who trust in him. He is able to help them in the time of trouble; he is willing to help them; he will help them. They who put their trust in him will find him a sure and certain help.

Whatever others do, let the elect of heaven keep fast to the God who chose them. Jehovah is the God of Jacob, let his children prove their loyalty to their God by their confidence in him. Whatever our trouble may be, and however fierce the blasphemous language of our enemies, let us not fear nor falter, but confidently rest in him who is able to vindicate his own honour, and protect his own servants. "He is their help and their shield." He is the friend of his servants, both actively and passively, giving them both aid in labour and defence in danger. In the use of the pronoun "their," the Psalmist may have spoken to himself, in a sort of soliloquy: he had given the exhortation, "trust in Jehovah," and then he whispers to himself, "They may well do so, for he is at all times the strength and security of his servants."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-10.htm">Psalm 115:10</a><p>"O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord." You who are nearest to him, trust him most; your very calling is connected with his truth and is meant to declare his glory, therefore never entertain a doubt concerning him, but lead the way in holy confidence. The priests were the leaders, teachers, and exemplars of the people, and therefore above all others they should place an unreserved reliance upon Israel's God. The Psalmist is glad to add that they did so, for he says, "He is their help and their shield." It is good to exhort those to faith who have faith: "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God;... that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God." We may stir up pure minds by way of remembrance, and exhort men to trust in the Lord because we know that they are trusting already.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-11.htm">Psalm 115:11</a><p>The next verse is of the same tenor - "Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Loan," whether belonging to Israel, or to the house of Aaron, or not, all those who reverence Jehovah are permitted and commanded to confide in him. "He is their help and their shield." He does aid and protect all those who worship him in filial fear, to whatever nation they may belong. No doubt these repeated exhortations were rendered necessary by the trying condition in which the children of Israel were found: the sneers of the adversary would assail all the people, they would most bitterly be felt by the priests and ministers, and those who were secret proselytes would groan in secret under the contempt forced upon their religion and their God, All this would be very staggering to faith, and therefore they were bidden again and again and again to trust in Jehovah.<p>This must have been a very pleasant song to households in Babylon, or far away in Persia, when they met together in the night to eat the Paschal supper in a land which knew them not, where they wept as they remembered Zion. We seem to hear them repeating the three-fold word, "Trust in Jehovah," men and women and little children singing out their scorn of the dominant idolatry, and declaring their adhesion to the one God of Israel. In the same manner in this day of blasphemy and rebuke it becomes us all to abound in testimonies to the truth of God. The sceptic is loud in his unbelief, let us be equally open in the avowal of our faith.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/115.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">O Israel, </span> do not thou follow the example of these brutish idolaters, but serve the Lord only. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their help; </span> who trust in God, as he now required.

Or, "the house of Israel hath trusted in the Lord": so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions: the Targum is, <p>"Israel trusteth in the Word of the Lord;'' <p>in distinction from the Heathens, that trust in their idols. But it is better rendered as an imperative, trust thou; it being an exhortation to Israel to trust in the Lord, in opposition to idols; and may be understood of Israel, literally taken, who were God's chosen covenant people, to whom he had made a revelation of himself, and of his will; and therefore should trust in him, and in no other; and of spiritual Israel, or all the elect of God, and redeemed of the Lamb; every Israelite indeed; every wrestling Jacob, and prevailing Israel; every praying soul; every sensible sinner, Jew or Gentile. It becomes them to trust in the Lord, not in the creature; not in their own strength, wisdom, riches, righteousness, or fleshly privileges; but in the Lord, as the God of nature, providence, and grace; as a promising and covenant keeping God, who is to be trusted with all, and for every thing temporal and spiritual, and at all times. <p>He is their help and their shield; the help and shield of every true Israelite; of everyone that trusts in the Lord; or, <p>"your help and your shield, O ye Israelites;'' <p>so Ben Balaam in Aben Ezra reads the words: which are a reason or argument encouraging trust in the Lord, since he is the help of his people; they are helpless in themselves, and vain is the help of man, for there is none in him; there is no help but in the Lord, and he is a present, seasonable, and sufficient help: Jehovah the Father has promised them help, and he is both able and faithful to make it good; he has laid help upon his Son for them; and has set up a throne of grace, where they may come for grace to help them in time of need: Christ has helped them out of the miserable estate they were fallen into by sin; he helps them on in their way to heaven, by his power and grace, and at last brings them thither: the Spirit of God helps them to the things of Christ; to many exceeding great and precious promises; and out of many difficulties, snares, and temptations; and he helps them in prayer under all their infirmities, and makes intercession for them, according to the will of God; and therefore they should trust in the Lord, Father, Son, and Spirit: and who is also "their shield", to protect and defend them from all dangers, evils, and enemies; what a shield is to the body, to secure it from hurt, that to the people of God are the love and favour of God, his power and might, his truth and faithfulness; as likewise Christ, his blood, righteousness, and salvation; and the Spirit, and his grace; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/115.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/115.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Israel</span>] The LXX and Syr. have <span class="ital">house of Israel</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-19.htm" title="Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:">Psalm 135:19</a>; hence the P.B.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he</span> is <span class="ital">their help and their shield</span>] At first sight the transition to the third person seems awkward, and some of the Ancient Versions (LXX, Syr., Jer.) read the verb in the preceding line with different vowels in the third person, <span class="ital">The house of I. trusteth in the Lord</span>.

Israel as a whole is first addressed, then the religious leaders of the people, then the inner circle of those who are truly God-fearing; or perhaps the Psalmist assumes the reality of their devotion and addresses people and priests together as ‘fearers of Jehovah.’ Many commentators however hold that by ‘fearers of Jehovah’ are meant Gentile proselytes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-41.htm" title="Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your name's sake;">1 Kings 8:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-6.htm" title="Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and takes hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:6</a>). In the N.T. God-fearing Gentiles, who had attached themselves more or less closely to the faith and worship of Israel, are designated as ‘those who fear,’ or ‘reverence, God’ (<span class="greekheb">οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Θεόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ σεβόμενοι τὸν Θεόν</span>, or <span class="greekheb">οἱ σεβόμενοι</span>) simply: <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-16.htm" title="Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, give audience.">Acts 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm" title="And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul.">Acts 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-7.htm" title="And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.">Acts 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-17.htm" title="Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.">Acts 17:17</a>). But the general usage of the O.T., and of the Psalter in particular, makes it improbable that the phrase ‘fearers of Jehovah’ has this sense here. In the closely parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm" title="You that fear the LORD, praise him; all you the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all you the seed of Israel.">Psalm 22:23</a>, it certainly denotes Israelites, whether it be understood as synonymous with the ‘seed of Israel’ or as designating an inner circle of true believers. The question is discussed by Prof. A. B. Davidson in the <span class="ital">Expository Times</span>, 1892, pp. 491 ff., who comes to the conclusion that “any reference to a Gentile element in the Palestinian community is wholly without probability.” It seems evident from the words “both small and great” of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-13.htm" title="He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.">Psalm 115:13</a></span> that it is not “some small section like Gentile proselytes” that is meant: and “the intensely national and even local spirit” of this and kindred Psalms (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-14.htm" title="The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.">Psalm 115:14</a></span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-21.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwells at Jerusalem.

Three several times the leader of the choir gives forth the call - " Trust in the Lord " - and three several times the choir responds with the acknowledgment that he, and he alone, "is their Help and Shield."
