If we are for him, he is for us; and if he is for us, we need not fear. Every creature is that to us, and no more, which God makes it to be. The Lord will in due time save his people, and in the mean time he sustains them, and bears them up, so that the spirit he has made shall not fail. There is truth in God's threatenings, as well as in his promises; sinners that repent not, will find it so to their cost. David's present deliverance was an earnest of further deliverance. He speaks of the completion of his deliverance as a thing done, though he had as yet many troubles before him; because, having God's promise for it, he was as sure of it as if it was done already. The Lord would deliver him out of all his troubles. May he help us to bear our cross without repining, and at length bring us to share his victories and glory. Christians never should suffer the voice of praise and thanksgiving to cease in the church of the redeemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/54.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he hath delivered me out of all trouble - This is spoken either in confident expectation of what would be, or as the statement of a general truth that God did deliver him from all trouble. It was what he had experienced in his past life; it was what he confidently expected in all time to come.<p>And mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies - The words "his desire" are not in the original. A literal translation would be, "And on my enemies hath my eye looked." The meaning is, that they had been overthrown; they had been unsuccessful in their malignant attempts against him; and he had had the satisfaction of "seeing" them thus discomfited. Their overthrow had not merely been reported to him, but he had had ocular demonstration of its reality. This is not the expression of malice, but of certainty. The fact on which the eye of the psalmist rested was his own safety. Of that he was assured by what he had witnessed with his own eyes; and in that fact he rejoiced. There is no more reason to charge malignity in this case on David, or to suppose that he rejoiced in the destruction of his enemies as such, than there is in our own case when we are rescued from impending danger. It is proper for Americans to rejoice in their freedom, and to give thanks to God for it; nor, in doing this, is it to be supposed that there is a malicious pleasure in the fact that in the accomplishment of this thousands of British soldiers were slain, or that thousands of women and children as the result of their discomfiture were made widows and orphans. We can be thankful for the mercies which we enjoy without having any malignant delight in those woes of others through which our blessings may have come upon us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/54.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. mine eye &#8230; desire&#8212;(compare Ps 59:10; 112:8), expresses satisfaction in beholding the overthrow of his enemies as those of God, without implying any selfish or unholy feeling (compare Ps 52:6, 7).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/54.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He speaks of it as a thing already done, either to express his assurance of it, or because this Psalm was made after it was done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His desire; </span> or, <span class="ital">thy vengeance</span>; which may be understood out of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm" title="He shall reward evil to my enemies: cut them off in your truth.">Psalm 54:5</a></span>.

Such rejoicing over the fall of enemies is not of the spirit of the Gospel. But the ‘salvation’ for which the Psalmist prays is a temporal deliverance, which can only be effected at the expense of the implacable enemies who are seeking his life; and it will be a vindication of God’s faithfulness and a proof of His righteous government at which he cannot but rejoice. The defeat of evil and the triumph of good presented themselves to the saints of the O.T. in this concrete form, which sometimes has a ring of personal vindictiveness about it, yet, fairly considered, is in its real motive and character elevated far above a mere thirst for revenge.

The obtaining of right for any one (&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>, and frequently, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>) is attributed to the all-conquering might of God, which is only one side of the divine Name, i.e., of the divine nature which manifests itself in the diversity of its attributes. &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-4.htm">Psalm 54:4</a>) is construed with &#1500; (cf. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-2.htm">Psalm 87:2</a>) like &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a>.

The inscription leads one to think of the Ziphites in particular in connection with "strangers" and "violent men." The two words in most instances denote foreign enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; but &#1494;&#1512; is also a stranger in the widest sense, regulated in each instance according to the opposite, e.g., the non-priest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>; and one's fellow-countrymen can also turn out to be &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-21.htm">Jeremiah 15:21</a>. The Ziphites, although Judaeans like David, might be called "strangers," because they had taken the side against David; and "violent men," because they pledged themselves to seize and deliver him up. Under other circumstances this might have been their duty as subjects. In this instance, however, it was godlessness, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a>) says. Any one at that time in Israel who feared God more than man, could not lend himself to be made a tool of Saul's blind fury. God had already manifestly enough acknowledged David. </body></html>
