David has no other plea to depend upon than God's name, no other power to depend upon than God's strength, and these he makes his refuge and confidence. This would be the effectual answer to his prayers. Looking unto David, betrayed by the men of Judah, and to Jesus, betrayed by one of his apostles, what can we expect from any who have not set God before them, save ingratitude, treachery, malice, and cruelty? What bonds of nature, or friendship, or gratitude, or covenant, will hold those that have broken through the fear of God? Selah; Mark this. Let us set God before us at all times; for if we do not, we are in danger of despair.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/54.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear my prayer, O God - My earnest cry for deliverance from the designs of those who would betray me.<p>Give ear to the words of my mouth - Incline thine ear to me, as one does who wishes to hear.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> it reads three times Elohim and four times Jahve; in the Psalm before us it is all seven times Elohim, which in this instance is a proper name of equal dignity with the name Jahve. Since the mingling of the two names in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-7</a> is perfectly intentional, inasmuch as Elohim in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/53-1.htm">Psalm 53:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-2.htm">Psalm 53:2</a> describes God as a Being most highly exalted and to be reverentially acknowledged, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a> as the Being who is present among men in the righteous generation and who is mighty in their weakness, it becomes clear that David himself cannot be the author of this levelling change, which is carried out more rigidly than the Elohimic character of the Psalm really demands. </body></html>
