David has no other plea to depend upon than God's name, no other power to depend upon than God's strength, and these he makes his refuge and confidence. This would be the effectual answer to his prayers. Looking unto David, betrayed by the men of Judah, and to Jesus, betrayed by one of his apostles, what can we expect from any who have not set God before them, save ingratitude, treachery, malice, and cruelty? What bonds of nature, or friendship, or gratitude, or covenant, will hold those that have broken through the fear of God? Selah; Mark this. Let us set God before us at all times; for if we do not, we are in danger of despair.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/54.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For strangers are risen up against me - That is, foreigners; those of another nation or land.

Meaning such as Doeg the Edomite, or Heathen soldiers, that Saul had hired and took into his army, who were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel; and such as these rose up against David's antitype, the Messiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>. Or rather the Ziphims, who were of his own nation, yea, of his own tribe, yet used him as barbarously as the very Heathens would have done, or worse; and who, though notwithstanding they were of Israel, might not be Israelites indeed, but strangers to an inward experience of divine and spiritual things: for men may be professors of religion, and yet be strangers to God in Christ, to Christ himself, and the way of salvation by him, and communion with him; to the Spirit of God, and the operations of his grace on the heart; to themselves, their own hearts, and their state and condition by nature; to the Gospel of Christ, and to the people of God; and these are sometimes the most violent persecutors of good and spiritual men; <p>and oppressors seek after my soul; or "life" (i), to take it away; as did Saul and his army; who are "the mighty" or "strong ones" (k), as the word here used signifies; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>; and as the Jewish sanhedrim, Scribes and Pharisees, sought after the soul or life of Christ, to take that away, as they did; <p>they have not set God before them. They did not consider themselves as under the omniscient eye of God; they did not set his word before them, as the rule of their conduct, but cast it behind their backs; nor did they regard his providential mercies and layouts as a motive to engage them to obedience to him, but despised them; they had not the fear of God before their eyes, nor in their hearts, nor any concern for his glory; and therefore did the wicked things they did against his servant. <p>Selah; on this word; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>. <p>(i) "vitam meam", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Michaelis.

This verse is repeated almost verbatim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-14.htm" title="O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set you before them.">Psalm 86:14</a> (a mosaic constructed of fragments of other Psalms), with the change, accidental or intentional, of <span class="ital">strangers</span> into <span class="ital">proud</span>. The consonants of the Heb. words zârîm, <span class="ital">strangers</span>, and zçdîm, <span class="ital">proud</span>, are almost identical, and some Heb. MSS. and the Targ. read zçdîm here; but the rest of the versions support the Massoretic Text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and oppressors</span> &c.] Render, and violent men have sought my life, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-15.htm" title="And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.">1 Samuel 23:15</a>, “David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life.” It has been argued that the terms ‘strangers’ and ‘violent men’ are inapplicable to Israelites, and prove that the title is erroneous. No doubt they are often used of foreign invaders or oppressors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-2.htm" title="For you have made of a city an heap; of a defended city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.">Isaiah 25:2</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm" title="Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.">Isaiah 29:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm" title="And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-7.htm" title="Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.">Isaiah 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-21.htm" title="And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.">Ezekiel 7:21</a>); but ‘violent men’ or ‘terrible ones’ is not exclusively so used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-23.htm" title="Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?">Job 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-21.htm" title="And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.">Jeremiah 15:21</a>), and might well be applied to Saul and his followers; while the Ziphites might be designated ‘strangers,’ in view of their unneighbourly behaviour. It is however possible that ‘strangers’ refers to the men of Keilah, whom there is some ground for regarding as Canaanites. The peculiar term ‘lords’ or ‘owners’ applied to the men of Keilah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/23-11.htm" title="Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down....">1 Samuel 23:11-12</a>) seems to have been specially (though not exclusively) used of Canaanites. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm" title="And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.">Joshua 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-2.htm" title="Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are three score and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.">Jdg 9:2</a> ff; and J. S. Black’s note on the latter passage in the <span class="ital">Smaller Cambridge Bible for Schools</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they have not set God before them</span>] They have no regard for God’s will, and no fear of His judgements. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/10-4.htm" title="The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts....">Psalm 10:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-1.htm" title="The transgression of the wicked said within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.">Psalm 36:1</a>; and contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-8.htm" title="I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.">Psalm 16:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-22.htm" title="For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.">Psalm 18:22</a>. Under other circumstances loyalty to Saul might have required the Ziphites to surrender David: as it was, they were simply fighting against God in making themselves the tools of Saul’s blind rage, for it must have been well known that God intended David to be Saul’s successor.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/54.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For strangers are risen up against me</span>. David's designation of his foes as "strangers" has been made an argument against the trustworthiness of the "title," since the Ziphites were Israelites of the tribe of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a>). But he might well call those "strangers" who were treating him as an alien. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>, where "the psalmist, heavily oppressed by his countrymen, complains that he dwelt in Mesheeh and Kedar" (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">And oppressors seek after my soul</span>; or, <span class="accented">my life.</span> The phrase is exactly that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-15.htm">1 Samuel 23:15</a>, when David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in a wood, and "saw that Saul was come out to <span class="accented">seek his life."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>They have not set God before them</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a>).
