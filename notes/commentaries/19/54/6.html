And to praise thy name is not only our duty, but our interest and our happiness. It is pleasant and profitable; good for us, as well as reasonable, just, and good in itself. <span class="ital">For he hath delivered me out of all trouble — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מכל צרה</span>, <span class="ital">michal tzarah, from every strait. </span>Or, as the Seventy render it, <span class="greekheb">εκ πασης θλιψεως</span>, <span class="ital">out of every affliction. </span>He speaks of his deliverance as already effected, either to express his assurance of it, or because this Psalm was made after it was wrought. <span class="ital">And mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies — </span>Not seen them cut off and ruined, but forced to retreat; tidings being brought to Saul that the Philistines <span class="ital">had invaded the land, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/23-27.htm" title="But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land....">1 Samuel 23:27-28</a>. All that David desired was to see himself safe: and when he saw Saul draw off his forces, he saw his desire. The words, <span class="ital">his desire, </span>however, are not in the Hebrew, which may be properly rendered, <span class="ital">mine eye hath looked upon mine enemies, </span>that is, “mine enemies came near enough to be seen by me, and that was all. God kept them from coming near me, so that they have all been disappointed of their prey.” This was the very case with David. He saw his enemies with pleasure at a distance, and he enjoyed the sight; especially when they marched off and left him to escape. His deliverance was great, and was manifestly the work of God, and he gave God the glory of it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/54.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>54:4-7 Behold, God is mine Helper. If we are for him, he is for us; and if he is for us, we need not fear. Every creature is that to us, and no more, which God makes it to be. The Lord will in due time save his people, and in the mean time he sustains them, and bears them up, so that the spirit he has made shall not fail. There is truth in God's threatenings, as well as in his promises; sinners that repent not, will find it so to their cost. David's present deliverance was an earnest of further deliverance. He speaks of the completion of his deliverance as a thing done, though he had as yet many troubles before him; because, having God's promise for it, he was as sure of it as if it was done already. The Lord would deliver him out of all his troubles. May he help us to bear our cross without repining, and at length bring us to share his victories and glory. Christians never should suffer the voice of praise and thanksgiving to cease in the church of the redeemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/54.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will freely sacrifice unto thee - The Hebrew words rendered "freely," mean with "willingness, voluntariness, spontaneousness." The idea is, that he would do it of a free or willing mind; without constraint or compulsion; voluntarily. The reference is to a free-will or voluntary offering, as distinguished from one, that was prescribed by law. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-3.htm">Exodus 36:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-16.htm">Leviticus 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-39.htm">Numbers 29:39</a>. The idea is, that as the result of the divine interposition which he prayed for, he would bring voluntary offerings to God in acknowledgment of his goodness and mercy.<p>I will praise thy name, O Lord - I will praise thee. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm">Psalm 52:9</a>.<p>For it is good - That is, God himself is benevolent; and David says that he would express his sense of God's goodness by offering him praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/54.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Not legal sacrifices; no, nor freewill offerings the law gives directions about, though the allusion is to them; but the freewill offerings of his mouth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-108.htm">Psalm 119:108</a>; the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, on account of help, salvation, and deliverance, as appears from the following clause; which he determines to offer, not by constraint, but willingly; not by force, but of a ready mind; freely, and with all his heart. The sacrifice of his antitype is himself, his soul and body, as in union with his divine Person; and this was offered up to God, against whom man has sinned, and whose justice must be satisfied; and this was done freely and voluntarily; he gave himself an offering; he laid down his life of himself, and that for sinners. The sacrifices of his people are their prayers and praises, their acts of beneficence, and the presentation of their souls and bodies in divine service; all which they do freely, under the influence of divine grace; <p>I will praise thy name, O Lord; which explains what is meant by sacrificing: this is what is due to the Lord, and comely in his people; <p>for it is good; either the name of God; and therefore to be praised. He himself is good, as, he is, both in a way of providence and of grace; and it is good, both pleasantly and profitably good, to sing praises to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-1.htm">Psalm 147:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/54.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for <i>it is</i> good.</span><p>(f) For hypocrites serve God out of fear or on conditions.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/54.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">I will freely sacrifice unto thee</span>] Or, With a free will I will sacrifice unto thee.
