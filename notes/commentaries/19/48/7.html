And that event may indeed have supplied the figure, but a figure for the dispersal of a <span class= "ital">land army. </span>We may render:<p>With a blast from the east<p>Thou breakest (them as) Tarshish ships.<p>Or,<p>With a blast from the east<p>(Which) breaketh Tarshish ships (thou breakest them),<p>according as we take the verb, second person masculine, or third person feminine.<p>Shakespeare, in <span class= "ital">King John, </span>compares the rout of an army to the dispersion of a fleet—<p>“So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,<p>A whole Armada of convicted sail<p>Is scattered and disjoined from fellowship.”<p>This is preferable to the suggestion that the seaboard tribes were in the alliance, whose break-up the psalm seems to commemorate, and that the sudden dispersion of their Armada ruined the enterprise. Tarshish ships, a common term for large merchantmen (comp. <span class= "ital">East Indiamen</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>from their use in the Tarshish trade, are here symbols of a powerful empire. Isaiah, in Isaiah 33, compares Assyria to a gallant ship.

Happy the kingdom, the city, the family, the heart, in which God is great, in which he is all. There God is known. The clearer discoveries are made to us of the Lord and his greatness, the more it is expected that we should abound in his praises. The earth is, by sin, covered with deformity, therefore justly might that spot of ground, which was beautified with holiness, be called the joy of the whole earth; that which the whole earth has reason to rejoice in, that God would thus in very deed dwell with man upon the earth. The kings of the earth were afraid of it. Nothing in nature can more fitly represent the overthrow of heathenism by the Spirit of the gospel, than the wreck of a fleet in a storm. Both are by the mighty power of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish - On the ships of Tarshish, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>. The allusion to these ships here may have been to illustrate the power of God; the ease with which he destroys that which man has made. The ships so strong - the ships made to navigate distant seas, and to encounter waves and storms - are broken to pieces with infinite ease when God causes the wind to sweep over the ocean. With so much ease God overthrows the most mighty armies, and scatters them. His power in the one case is strikingly illustrated by the other. It is not necessary, therefore, to suppose that there was any actual occurrence of this kind particularly in the eye of the psalmist; but it is an interesting fact that such a disaster did befall the navy of Jehoshaphat himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a> : "Jehoshaphat made "ships of Tarshish" to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not: "for the ships were broken" at Ezion-geber." Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36-37</a>. This coincidence would seem to render it not improbable that the discomfiture of the enemies of Jehoshaphat was particularly referred to in this psalm, and that the overthrow of his enemies when Jerusalem was threatened called to remembrance an important event in his own history, when the power of God was illustrated in a manner not less unexpected and remarkable. If this was the allusion, may not the reference to the "breaking of the ships of Tarshish" have been designed to show to Jehoshaphat, and to the dwellers in Zion, that they should not be proud and self-confident, by reminding them of the ease with which God had scattered and broken their own mighty navy, and by showing them that what he had done to their enemies he could do to them also, notwithstanding the strength of their city, and that their "real" defense was not in walls and bulwarks reared by human hand, anymore than it could be in the natural strength of their position only, but in God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. ships of Tarshish&#8212;as engaged in a distant and lucrative trade, the most valuable.

The language is plainly metaphorical. God’s might is irresistible. He shatters the stately ships of Tarshish with a sudden storm: with equal ease He annihilates the vast Assyrian army.

The literal exposition is wholly out of place, since history does not speak of any co-operation of a fleet with a land army in any attack upon Pales. fine. The expression must be used metaphorically of a great and violent destruction wrought by the arm of God upon Israel's foes. Still, the imagery would scarcely have been used, unless there had been something in the circumstances of the time to suggest it, as there certainly was in Jehoshaphat's time, whose fleet of "ships of Tamhish" was "broken" at Ezion-geber (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). The poet may have witnessed the catastrophe. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 48:2-9) Viewed as to the nature of its subject-matter, the Psalm divides itself into three parts. We begin by considering the three strophes of the first part. The middle strophe presents an instance of the rising and falling caesural schema. Because Jahve has most marvellously delivered Jerusalem, the poet begins with the praise of the great King and of His Holy City. Great and praised according to His due (&#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>) is He in her, is He upon His holy mountain, which there is His habitation. Next follow, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>, two predicates of a threefold, or fundamentally only twofold, subject; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;, in whatever way it may be understood, is in apposition to &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;. The predicates consequently refer to Zion-Jerusalem; for &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1512;&#1489; is not a name for Zion, but, inasmuch as the transition is from the holy mountain to the Holy City (just as the reverse is the case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>), Jerusalem; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-35.htm">Matthew 5:35</a>. Of Zion-Jerusalem it is therefore said, it is &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1504;&#1493;&#1507;, beautiful in prominence or elevation (&#1504;&#1493;&#1507; from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, Arabic na&#770;fa, nauf, root &#1504;&#1507;, the stronger force of &#1504;&#1489;, Arab. nb, to raise one's self, to mount, to come sensibly forward; just as &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; also goes back to a root &#1497;&#1507;, Arab. yf, wf, which signifies "to rise, to be high," and is transferred in the Hebrew to eminence, perfection, beauty of form), a beautifully rising terrace-like height; <p>(Note: Luther with Jerome (departing from the lxx and Vulgate) renders it: "Mount Zion is like a beautiful branch," after the Mishna-Talmudic &#1504;&#1493;&#1507;, a branch, Maccoth 12a, which is compared also by Saadia and Dunash. The latter renders it "beautiful in branches," and refers it to the Mount of Olives.) <p>and, in the second place, it is the joy (&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1513;&#1474;) of the whole earth. It is deserving of being such, as the people who dwell there are themselves convinced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>); and it is appointed to become such, it is indeed such even now in hope, - hope which is, as it were, being anticipatorily verified. but in what sense does the appositional &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; follow immediately upon &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;? Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, Caspari (Micha, p. 359), and others, are of opinion that the hill of Zion is called the extreme north with reference to the old Asiatic conception of the mountain of the gods - old Persic Ar-bur'g (Al-bur'g), and also called absolutely hara or haraiti, <p>(Note: Vid., Spiegel, Era&#770;n, S. 287f.) <p>old Indian Kaila&#770;sa and Me&#770;ru <p>(Note: Vide Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, ii.847.)<p> - forming the connecting link between heaven and earth, which lay in the inaccessible, holy distance and concealment of the extreme north. But the poet in no way betrays the idea that he applies this designation to Zion in an ideal sense only, as being not inferior to the extreme north (Bertheau, Lage des Paradieses, S. 50, and so also S. D. Luzzatto on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>), or as having taken the place of it (Hitzig). That notion is found, it is true, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, in the mouth of the king of the Chaldeans; but, with the exception of the passage before us, we have no trace of the Israelitish mind having blended this foreign mythological style of speech with its own. We therefore take the expression "sides of the north" to be a topographical designation, and intended literally. Mount Zion is thereby more definitely designated as the Temple-hill; for the Temple-hill, or Zion in the narrower sense, formed in reality the north-eastern angle or corner of ancient Jerusalem. It is not necessarily the extreme north (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>), which is called &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; are the two sides, then the angle in which the two side lines meet, and just such a northern angle was Mount Moriah by its position in relation to the city of David and the lower city.</body></html>
