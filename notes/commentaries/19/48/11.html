All the streams of mercy that flow down to us, must be traced to the fountain of His loving-kindness. Let us give to God the glory of the great things he has done for us. Let all the members of the church take comfort from what the Lord does for his church. Let us observe the beauty, strength, and safety of the church. Consider its strength; see it founded on Christ the Rock, fortified by the Divine power, guarded by Him who neither slumbers nor sleeps. See what precious ordinances are its palaces, what precious promises are its bulwarks, that you may be encouraged to join yourselves to it: and tell this to others. This God, who has now done such great things for us, is unchangeable in his love to us, and his care for us. If he is our God, he will lead and keep us even to the last. He will so guide us, as to set us above the reach of death, so that it shall not do us any real hurt.

Mount Zion is evidently used here to designate the city; and the idea is, that the city of God - the holy city - had occasion for joy and gladness in view of the manifestation of the divine favor.<p>Let the daughters of Judah be glad - The phrase "daughters of Judah" "may" denote the smaller cities in the tribe of Judah, that surrounded Jerusalem as the "mother" city - in accordance with an usage quite common in the Hebrew Scriptures. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>. Perhaps, however, the more obvious interpretation is the correct one, as meaning that the women of Judah had special occasion to rejoice on account of their deliverance from so great danger, and from the horrors which usually attended the siege or the conquest of the city - the atrocities which commonly befall the female sex when a city is captured in war. The "daughters of Judah" are those descended from Judah, or connected with the tribe of Judah. Jerusalem was in the bounds of that tribe, and the name Judah was given to all those that remained after the removal of the ten tribes.<p>Because of thy judgments - Thy righteous interposition in delivering the city and people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the daughters, &c.&#8212;the small towns, or the people, with the chief city, or rulers of the Church.<p>judgments&#8212;decisions and acts of right government.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/48.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mount Zion; </span> synecdochically put for Jerusalem. <span class="ital">The daughters of Judah</span>, i.e. the other and lesser cities and towns or villages (i.e. all the people) of Judah; for such are commonly called daughters in respect of the mother city, to which they are subjects: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-45.htm" title="Ekron, with her towns and her villages:">Joshua 15:45</a> 17:16 <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm" title="And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor.">Psalm 45:12</a> 137:8</span>.

Elohim has made Himself known by the loftily built parts <p>(Note: lxx: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, on which Gregory of Nyssa remarks (Opera, Ed.

The fact by which He has thus made Himself known now immediately follows. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; points to a definite number of kings known to the poet; it therefore speaks in favour of the time of peril and war in the reign of Jehoshaphat and against that in the reign of Hezekiah. &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is reciprocal: to appoint themselves a place of meeting, and meet together there. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a>, of crossing the frontier and invasion (Hitzig), not of perishing and destruction, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-36.htm">Psalm 37:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a> (De Wette); for &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493; requires further progress, and the declaration respecting their sudden downfall does not follow till later on. The allies encamped in the desert to Tekoa, about three hours distant from Jerusalem. The extensive view at that point extends even to Jerusalem: as soon as they saw it they were amazed, i.e., the seeing and astonishment, panic and confused flight, occurred all together; there went forth upon them from the Holy City, because Elohim dwells therein, a &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a>), or as we should say, a panic or a panic-striking terror. Concerning &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; as expressive of simultaneousness, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in the correlative protasis is omitted, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>, and frequently; cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-9.htm">Isaiah 55:9</a>. Trembling seized upon them there (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>), pangs as of a woman in travail. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>, the description passes over emotionally into the form of address. It moulds itself according to the remembrance of a recent event of the poet's own time, viz., the destruction of the merchant fleet fitted out by Jehoshaphat in conjunction with Ahaziah, king of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>.). The general meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a> is, that God's omnipotence is irresistible. Concerning the "wind of the east quarter," which here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>, causes shipwreck, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>. The "ships of Tarshish," as is clear from the context both before and after, are not meant literally, but used as a figure of the worldly powers; Isaiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/33.htm">Isaiah 33</a>) also compares Assyria to a gallant ship. Thus, then, the church can say that in the case of Jerusalem it has, as an eye-witness, experienced that which it has hitherto only heard from the tradition of a past age (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a>), viz., that God holds it erect, establishes it, for ever. Hengstenberg observes here, "The Jerusalem that has been laid in ruins is not that which the psalmist means; it is only its outward form which it has put off" [lit. its broken and deserted pupa]. It is true that, according to its inner and spiritual nature, Jerusalem continues its existence in the New Testament church; but it is not less true that its being trodden under foot for a season in the kairoi' ethnoo'n no more annuls the promise of God than Israel's temporary rejection annuls Israel's election. The Holy City does not fall without again rising up. </body></html>
