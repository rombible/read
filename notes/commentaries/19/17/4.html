Feigned prayers are fruitless; but if our hearts lead our prayers, God will meet them with his favour. The psalmist had been used to pray, so that it was not his distress and danger that now first brought him to his duty. And he was encouraged by his faith to expect God would notice his prayers. Constant resolution and watchfulness against sins of the tongue, will be a good evidence of our integrity. Aware of man's propensity to wicked works, and of his own peculiar temptations, David had made God's word his preservative from the paths of Satan, which lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very comfortable in the reflection, when we are in trouble. Those that are, through grace, going in God's paths, should pray that their goings may be held up in those paths. David prays, Lord, still hold me up. Those who would proceed and persevere in the ways of God, must, by faith prayer, get daily fresh supplies of grace and strength from him. Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, distinguishing favours, not common mercies, but be gracious to me; do as thou usest to do to those who love thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Concerning the works of men - In respect to the works or doings of men. The reference is here probably to the ordinary or common doings of mankind, or to what generally characterizes the conduct of men. As their conduct is so commonly, and so characteristically wicked, wickedness may be spoken of as their "work," and it is to this doubtless that the psalmist refers. In respect to the sinful courses or "paths" to which men are so prone, he says that he had kept himself from them. This is in accordance with what he says in the previous verse, that he had given no occasion by his conduct for the treatment which he had received at the hands of his enemies.<p>By the word of thy lips - Not by his own strength; not by any power which he himself had, but by the commands and promises of God - by what had proceeded from his mouth. The reference is doubtless to all that God had spoken: to the law which prescribed his duty, and to the promises which God had given to enable him to walk in the path of uprightness. He had relied on the word of God as inculcating duty; he had submitted to it as authority; he had found encouragement in it in endeavoring to do right.<p>I have kept me - I have preserved myself. I have so guarded my conduct that I have not fallen into the sins which are so common among men.<p>The paths of the destroyer - The paths which the "destroyer" treads; the course of life which such men lead. The idea is, not that he had been able to save himself from violence at their hands, but that he had been enabled to avoid their mode of life. The word rendered "destroyer" is from a verb which means "to break, to rend, to scatter," and would properly refer to acts of violence and lawlessness. He had kept himself from the modes of life of the violent and the lawless; that is, he had been enabled to lead a peaceful and quiet lift. He had given no occasion to his enemies to treat him as a violent, a lawless, a wicked man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. works of men&#8212;sinful practices.<p>by the word of thy lips&#8212;as a guide (Ps 119:9, 11, 95).<p>destroyer&#8212;violent man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Concerning the works of men:</span> concerning my care and caution about my words, I have now spoken, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm" title="You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.">Psalm 17:3</a></span>, now I may say the like concerning my works.

Because Jahve is thus near at hand to help him, his heart becomes joyful (&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;) and his glory, i.e., his soul (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>) rejoices, the joy breaking forth in rejoicing, as the fut. consec. affirms. There is no passage of Scripture that so closely resembles this as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>. &#1500;&#1489; is &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;), &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; (vid., Psychol. S. 98; tr. p. 119), &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (according to its primary meaning, attrectabile, that which is frail), &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;.

He looks death calmly and triumphantly in the face, even his flesh shall dwell or lie securely, viz., without being seized with trembling at its approaching corruption. David's hope rests on this conclusion: it is impossible for the man, who, in appropriating faith and actual experience, calls God his own, to fall into the hands of death. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> shows, that what is here thought of in connection with &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;, dwelling in safety under the divine protection (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-24.htm">Proverbs 3:24</a>), is preservation from death. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; is rendered by the lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, as though it came from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, as perhaps it may do in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a> the lxx has &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which is the more correct: prop. a sinking in, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; to sink, to be sunk, like &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, &#1512;&#1495;&#1514; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;. To leave to the unseen world (&#1506;&#1494;&#1489; prop. to loosen, let go) is equivalent to abandoning one to it, so that he becomes its prey. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> - where to see the grave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>), equivalent to, to succumb to the state of the grave, i.e., death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-49.htm">Psalm 89:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-26.htm">Luke 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm">John 8:51</a>) is the opposite of "seeing life," i.e., experiencing and enjoying it (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>), the sense of sight being used as the noblest of the senses to denote the sensus communis, i.e., the common sense lying at the basis of all feeling and perception, and figuratively of all active and passive experience (Psychol. S. 234; tr. p. 276) - shows, that what is said here is not intended of an abandonment by which, having once come under the power of death, there is no coming forth again (Bttcher). It is therefore the hope of not dying, that is expressed by David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>. for by &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498; David means himself. According to Norzi, the Spanish MSS have &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; with the Masoretic note &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512; &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;, and the lxx, Targ., and Syriac translate, and the Talmud and Midrash interpret it, in accordance with this Ker. There is no ground for the reading &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;, and it is also opposed by the personal form of expression surrounding it.<p>(Note: Most MSS and the best, which have no distinction of Ker and Chethb here, read &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, as also the Biblia Ven. 1521, the Spanish Polyglott and other older printed copies. Those MSS which give &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; (without any Ker), on the other hand, scarcely come under consideration.)<p>The positive expression of hope in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a> comes as a companion to the negative just expressed: Thou wilt grant me to experience (&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;, is used, as usual, of the presentation of a knowledge, which concerns the whole man and not his understanding merely) &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the path of life, i.e., the path to life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-19.htm">Proverbs 2:19</a> with ib. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-17.htm">Psalm 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-14.htm">Matthew 7:14</a>); but not so that it is conceived of as at the final goal, but as leading slowly and gradually onwards to life; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in the most manifold sense, as, e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15</a> : life from God, with God, and in God, the living God; the opposite of death, as the manifestation of God's wrath and banishment from Him. That his body shall not die is only the external and visible phase of that which David hopes for himself; on its inward, unseen side it is a living, inwrought of God in the whole man, which in its continuance is a walking in the divine life. The second part of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>, which consists of two members, describes this life with which he solaces himself. According to the accentuation, - which marks &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; with Olewejored not with Rebia magnum or Pazer, - &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; is not a second object dependent upon &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, but the subject of a substantival clause: a satisfying fulness of joy is &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, with Thy countenance, i.e., connected with and naturally produced by beholding Thy face (&#1488;&#1514; preposition of fellowship, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-7.htm">Psalm 21:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-14.htm">Psalm 140:14</a>); for joy is light, and God's countenance, or doxa, is the light of lights. And every kind of pleasurable things, &#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, He holds in His right hand, extending them to His saints - a gift which lasts for ever; &#1504;&#1510;&#1495; equivalent to &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;. &#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, from the primary notion of conspicuous brightness, is duration extending beyond all else - an expression for &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, which David has probably coined, for it appears for the first time in the Davidic Psalms. Pleasures are in Thy right hand continually - God's right hand is never empty, His fulness is inexhaustible.<p>The apostolic application of this Psalm (<a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29-32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35-37</a>) is based on the considerations that David's hope of not coming under the power of death was not realised in David himself, as is at once clear, to the unlimited extent in which it is expressed in the Psalm; but that it is fulfilled in Jesus, who has not been left to Hades and whose flesh did not see corruption; and that consequently the words of the Psalm are a prophecy of David concerning Jesus, the Christ, who was promised as the heir to his throne, and whom, by reason of the promise, he had prophetically before his mind. If we look into the Psalm, we see that David, in his mode of expression, bases that hope simply upon his relation to Jahve, the ever-living One. That it has been granted to him in particular, to express this hope which is based upon the mystic relation of the &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491; to Jahve in such language, - a hope which the issue of Jesus' life has sealed by an historical fulfilment, - is to be explained from the relation, according to the promise, in which David stands to his seed, the Christ and Holy One of God, who appeared in the person of Jesus. David, the anointed of God, looking upon himself as in Jahve, the God who has given the promise, becomes the prophet of Christ; but this is only indirectly, for he speaks of himself, and what he says has also been fulfilled in his own person. But this fulfilment is not limited to the condition, that he did not succumb to any peril that threatened his life so long as the kingship would have perished with him, and that, when he died, the kingship nevertheless remained (Hofmann); nor, that he was secured against all danger of death until he had accomplished his life's mission, until he had fulfilled the vocation assigned to him in the history of the plan of redemption (Kurtz) - the hope which he cherishes for himself personally has found a fulfilment which far exceeds this. After his hope has found in Christ its full realisation in accordance with the history of the plan of redemption, it receives through Christ its personal realisation for himself also. For what he says, extends on the one hand far beyond himself, and therefore refers prophetically to Christ: in decachordo Psalterio - as Jerome boldly expresses it - ab inferis suscitat resurgentem. But on the other hand that which is predicted comes back upon himself, to raise him also from death and Hades to the beholding of God. Verus justitiae sol - says Sontag in his Tituli Psalmorum, 1687 -  e sepulcro resurrexit, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; seu lapis sepulcralis a monumento devolutus, arcus triumphalis erectus, victoria ab hominibus reportata. En vobis Michtam! En Evangelium! -  </body></html>
