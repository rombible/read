This prayer is a prediction that Christ would be preserved, through all the hardships and difficulties of his humiliation, to the glories and joys of his exalted state, and is a pattern to Christians to commit the keeping of their souls to God, trusting him to preserve them to his heavenly kingdom. Those are our worst enemies, that are enemies to our souls. They are God's sword, which cannot move without him, and which he will sheathe when he has done his work with it. They are his hand, by which he chastises his people. There is no fleeing from God's hand, but by fleeing to it. It is very comfortable, when we are in fear of the power of man, to see it dependent upon, and in subjection to the power of God. Most men look on the things of this world as the best things; and they look no further, nor show any care to provide for another life. The things of this world are called treasures, they are so accounted; but to the soul, and when compared with eternal blessings, they are trash. The most afflicted Christian need not envy the most prosperous men of the world, who have their portion in this life. Clothed with Christ's righteousness, having through his grace a good heart and a good life, may we by faith behold God's face, and set him always before us. When we awake every morning, may we be satisfied with his likeness set before us in his word, and with his likeness stamped upon us by his renewing grace. Happiness in the other world is prepared only for those that are justified and sanctified: they shall be put in possession of it when the soul awakes, at death, out of its slumber in the body, and when the body awakes, at the resurrection, out of its slumber in the grave. There is no satisfaction for a soul but in God, and in his good will towards us, and his good work in us; yet that satisfaction will not be perfect till we come to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Like as a lion - Margin, "The likeness of him" (that is, "of every one of them") is "as a lion that desireth to ravin." The meaning is plain. They were like a lion intent on securing his prey. They watched the object narrowly; they were ready to spring upon it.<p>That is greedy of his prey - "He is craving to tear." Prof. Alexander. - The Hebrew word rendered "is greedy," means "to pine, to long after, to desire greatly." The Hebrew word rendered "of his prey," is a verb, meaning "to pluck, to tear, to rend in pieces." The reference is to the lion that desires to seize his victim, and to rend it in pieces to devour it.<p>And, as it were, a young lion - Hebrew, "And like a young lion."<p>Lurking in secret places - Margin, as in Hebrew, "sitting." The allusion is to the lion crouching, or lying in wait for a favorable opportunity to pounce upon his prey. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8-10</a>. There is no special emphasis to be affixed to the fact that the "lion" is alluded to in one member of this verse, and the "young lion" in the other. It is in accordance with the custom of parallelism in Hebrew poetry where the same idea, with some little variation, is expressed in both members of the sentence.

The &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;<p>(Note: The word is pointed &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, in correct texts, as &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; always is when it has Munach and Dech follows, e.g., also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a>. This Gaja demands an emphatic intonation of the secondary word in its relation to the principal word (which here is &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;).)<p>found beside &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; (the perfect referring to that which has just now been put into execution) is meant to imply: such an one as he has described himself to be according to the testimony of his conscience, may call upon God, for God hears such and will therefore also hear him. &#1492;&#1496; &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1498; exactly corresponds to the Latin au-di (aus-cul-ta). The Hiph. &#1492;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-22.htm">Psalm 31:22</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm">Psalm 4:4</a>) signifies here to work in an extraordinary and marvellous manner. The danger of him who thus prays is great, but the mercies of God, who is ready and able to help, are still greater. Oh that He may, then, exhibit all its fulness on his behalf. The form of the address resembles the Greek, which is so fond of participles. If it is translated as Luther translates it: "Show Thy marvellous lovingkindness, Thou Saviour of those who trust in Thee, Against those who so set themselves against Thy right hand," then &#1495;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; is used just as absolutely as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>, and the right hand of God is conceived of as that which arranges and makes firm. But "to rebel against God's right (not statuta, but desteram)" is a strange expression. There are still two other constructions from which to choose, viz., "Thou Deliverer of those seeking protection from adversaries, with Thy right hand" (Hitz.), or: "Thou Helper of those seeking protection from adversaries, at Thy right hand" (Aben-Ezra, Tremell.). This last rendering is to be preferred to the two others. Since, on the one hand, one says &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503;, refuge from..., and on the other, &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; to hide one's self in any one, or in any place, this determining of the verbal notion by the preposition (on this, see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>) must be possible in both directions. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1502;&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-7.htm">Job 27:7</a>; and &#1495;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498;, those seeking protection at the strong hand of Jahve. The force of the &#1489; is just the same as in connection with &#1492;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19</a>. In Damascus and throughout Syria - Wetzstein observes on this passage - the weak make use of these words when they surrender themselves to the strong: Arab. ana&#770; b-qabd&#803;t ydk, "I am in the grasp of thy hand (in thy closed hand) i.e., I give myself up entirely to thee."<p>(Note: Cognate in meaning to &#1495;&#1505;&#1492; &#1489; are Arab. 'sttr b and tadarra&#770; b, e.g., Arab. td&#817;rra&#770; b-'l-h&#803;a&#770;'t&#803; mn 'l-r&#305;&#770;h&#803; he shelters (hides) himself by the wall from the wind, or Arab. ba&#770;l&#8219;d&#803;a&#770;t mn 'l-brd, by a fire against the cold, and Arab. &#8219;a&#770;d&#817;, which is often applied in like manner to God's protection. Thus, e.g., (according to Bochri's Sunna) a woman, whom Muhammed wanted to seize, cried out: Arab. a&#8219;u&#770;d&#817;u b-'llh mnk, I place myself under God's protection against thee, and he replied: Arab. &#8219;ud&#817;ti bi-ma&#8219;a&#770;d&#817;in, thou hast taken refuge in an (inaccessible) asylum (cf. Job, i. 310 n. and ii. 22 n. 2).) </body></html>
