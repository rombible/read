This prayer is a prediction that Christ would be preserved, through all the hardships and difficulties of his humiliation, to the glories and joys of his exalted state, and is a pattern to Christians to commit the keeping of their souls to God, trusting him to preserve them to his heavenly kingdom. Those are our worst enemies, that are enemies to our souls. They are God's sword, which cannot move without him, and which he will sheathe when he has done his work with it. They are his hand, by which he chastises his people. There is no fleeing from God's hand, but by fleeing to it. It is very comfortable, when we are in fear of the power of man, to see it dependent upon, and in subjection to the power of God. Most men look on the things of this world as the best things; and they look no further, nor show any care to provide for another life. The things of this world are called treasures, they are so accounted; but to the soul, and when compared with eternal blessings, they are trash. The most afflicted Christian need not envy the most prosperous men of the world, who have their portion in this life. Clothed with Christ's righteousness, having through his grace a good heart and a good life, may we by faith behold God's face, and set him always before us. When we awake every morning, may we be satisfied with his likeness set before us in his word, and with his likeness stamped upon us by his renewing grace. Happiness in the other world is prepared only for those that are justified and sanctified: they shall be put in possession of it when the soul awakes, at death, out of its slumber in the body, and when the body awakes, at the resurrection, out of its slumber in the grave. There is no satisfaction for a soul but in God, and in his good will towards us, and his good work in us; yet that satisfaction will not be perfect till we come to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Keep me as the apple of the eye - Preserve me; guard me; defend me, as one defends that which is to him most precious and valuable. In the original there is a remarkable strength of expression, and at the same time a remarkable confusion of gender in the language. The literal translation would be, "Keep me as the little man - the daughter of the eye." The word "apple" applied to the eye means the pupil, the little aperture in the middle of the eye, through which the rays of light pass to form an image on the retina ("Johnson, Webster"); though "why" it is called the "apple" of the eye the lexicographers fail to tell us. The Hebrew word - &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;  '&#305;&#770;ysho&#770;n - means properly, "a little man," and is given to the apple or pupil of the eye, "in which, as in a mirror, a person sees his own image reflected in miniature." This comparison is found in several languages. The word occurs in the Old Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-2.htm">Proverbs 7:2</a>; where it is rendered "apple;" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm">Proverbs 7:9</a>, where it is rendered "black;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>, where it is rendered "obscure." The other expression in the Hebrew - "the daughter of the eye" - is derived from a usage of the Hebrew word "daughter," as denoting that which is dependent on, or connected with (Gesenius, Lexicon), as the expression "daughters of a city" denotes the small towns or villages lying around a city, and dependent on its jurisdiction, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>. So the expression "daughters of song," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>. The idea here is, that the little image is the "child" of the eye; that it has its birth or origin there. The prayer of the psalmist here is, that God would guard him, as one guards his sight - an object so dear and valuable to him.<p>Hide me under the shadow of thy wings - Another image denoting substantially the same thing. This is taken from the care evinced by fowls in protecting their young, by gathering them under their wings. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>. Both of the comparisons used here are found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10-12</a>; and it is probable that the psalmist had that passage in his eye - "He instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye; as an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings; so the Lord alone did lead him."

He knows that he is not merely righteous in his relation to man, but also in his relation to God. In all such assertions of pious self-consciousness, that which is intended is a righteousness of life which has its ground in the righteousness of faith. True, Hupfeld is of opinion, that under the Old Testament nothing was known either of righteousness which is by faith or of a righteousness belonging to another and imputed. But if this were true, then Paul was in gross error and Christianity is built upon the sand. But the truth, that faith is the ultimate ground of righteousness, is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, and at other turning-points in the course of the history of redemption; and the truth, that the righteousness which avails before God is a gift of grace is, for instance, a thought distinctly marked out in the expression of Jeremiah &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;, "the Lord our righteousness." The Old Testament conception, it is true, looks more to the phenomena than to the root of the matter (ist mehr phnomenell als wurzelhaft), is (so to speak) more Jacobic than Pauline; but the righteousness of life of the Old Testament and that of the New have one and the same basis, viz., in the grace of God, the Redeemer, towards sinful man, who in himself is altogether wanting in righteousness before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>). Thus there is no self-righteousness, in David's praying that the righteousness, which in him is persecuted and cries for help, may be heard. For, on the one hand, in his personal relation to Saul, he knows himself to be free from any ungrateful thoughts of usurpation, and on the other, in his personal relation to God free from &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, i.e., self-delusion and hypocrisy. The shrill cry for help, &#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, which he raises, is such as may be heard and answered, because they are not lips of deceit with which he prays. The actual fact is manifest &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, therefore may his right go forth &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, - just what does happen, by its being publicly proclaimed and openly maintained - from Him, for His eyes, the eyes of Him who knoweth the hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>), behold &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, and many other passages), in uprightness, i.e., in accordance with the facts of the case and without partiality. &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; might also be an accusative of the object (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-17.htm">1 Chronicles 29:17</a>), but the usage of the language much more strongly favours the adverbial rendering, which is made still more natural by the confirmatory relation in which <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a> stands to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a>. </body></html>
