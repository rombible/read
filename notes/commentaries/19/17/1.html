Feigned prayers are fruitless; but if our hearts lead our prayers, God will meet them with his favour. The psalmist had been used to pray, so that it was not his distress and danger that now first brought him to his duty. And he was encouraged by his faith to expect God would notice his prayers. Constant resolution and watchfulness against sins of the tongue, will be a good evidence of our integrity. Aware of man's propensity to wicked works, and of his own peculiar temptations, David had made God's word his preservative from the paths of Satan, which lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very comfortable in the reflection, when we are in trouble. Those that are, through grace, going in God's paths, should pray that their goings may be held up in those paths. David prays, Lord, still hold me up. Those who would proceed and persevere in the ways of God, must, by faith prayer, get daily fresh supplies of grace and strength from him. Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, distinguishing favours, not common mercies, but be gracious to me; do as thou usest to do to those who love thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear the right - Margin, as in Hebrew, "justice." The prayer is, that God would regard that which was "right" in the case, or that he would vindicate the psalmist from that which was wrong. It is the expression of his confident assurance even in the presence of God that his cause was right, and that he was asking only that which it would be consistent for a "just" God to do. We can offer an acceptable prayer only when we are sure that it would be right for God to answer it, or that it would be consistent with perfect and eternal justice to grant our requests. It is to be observed here, however, that the ground of the petition of the psalmist is not that "he" was righteous, that is, he did not base his petition on the ground of his own merits, but that his "cause" was righteous; that he was unjustly oppressed and persecuted by his enemies. We cannot ask God to interpose in our behalf because we have a claim to his favor on the ground of our own merit; we may ask him to interpose because wrong is done, and his glory will be promoted in securing that which is just and right.<p>Attend unto my cry - The word used here - &#1512;&#1504;&#1492;  rinna&#770;h - means either a shout of joy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-1.htm">Psalm 47:1</a>; or a mournful cry, outcry, wailing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>; et soepe. It is expressive, in either case, of deep feeling which vents itself in an audible manner. Here it denotes the earnest "utterance" of prayer.<p>Give ear unto my prayer - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-1.htm">Psalm 5:1</a>.<p>That goeth not out of feigned lips - Margin, as in Hebrew, "without lips of deceit." That is, that is sincere, or that proceeds from the heart. The utterance of the lips does not misrepresent the feelings of the heart. True prayer is that in which the lips "do" represent the real feelings of the soul. In hypocritical prayer the one is no proper representation of the other. It is evident that the prayer here was not mere mental prayer, or a mere desire of the heart. It was uttered prayer, or oral prayer; and, though private, it was in the form of uttered words. The feeling was so great that it was expressed in an audible cry to God. Deep emotion usually finds vent in such audible and fervent expressions. Compare the Saviour's earnest prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a> ff. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 17<p>Ps 17:1-15. This Psalm is termed a prayer because the language of petition is predominant. With a just cause, sincerely presented, the writer prays for a just decision and help and protection. Pleading former mercies as a ground of hope, he urges his prayer in view of the malice, pride, rapacity, and selfishness of his foes, whose character is contrasted with his pious devotion and delight in God's favor.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/17.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Hear the right, O Lord attend unto my unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of reigned lips.<p>2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.<p>3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.<p>4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-1.htm">Psalm 17:1</a><p>"Hear the right, O Lord." He that has the worst cause makes the most noise; hence the oppressed soul is apprehensive that its voice may be drowned, and therefore pleads in this one verse for a hearing no less than three times. The troubled heart craves for the ear of the great Judge, persuaded that with him to hear is to redress if our God could not or would not hear us, our state would be deplorable indeed; and yet some professors set such small store by the mercy-seat, that God does not hear them for the simple reason that they neglect to plead. As well have no house if we persist like gypsies in living in the lanes and commons; as well have no mercy-seat as be always defending our own cause and never going to God. There is more fear that we will not hear the Lord than that the Lord will not hear us. "Hear the right;" it is well if our case is good in itself and can be urged as a right one, for right shall never be wronged by our righteous Judge; but if our suit be marred by our infirmities, it is a great privilege that we may make mention of the righteousness of our Lord Jesus, which is ever prevalent on high. Right has a voice which Jehovah always hears; and if my wrongs clamour against me with great force and fury, I will pray the Lord to hear that still louder and mightier voice of the right, and the rights of his dear Son. "Hear, O God, the just One;" i.e., "hear the Messiah," is a rendering adopted by Jerome, and admired by Bishop Horsley, whether correct or not as a translation, it is proper enough as a plea. Let the reader plead it at the throne of the righteous God, even when all other arguments are unavailing.<p>"Attend unto my cry." This shows the vehemence and earnestness of the petitioner; he is no mere talker, he weeps and laments. Who can resist a cry? A real hearty, bitter, piteous cry, might almost melt a rock, there can be no fear of its prevalence with our heavenly Father. A cry is our earliest utterance, and in many ways the most natural of human sounds; if our prayer should like the infant's cry be more natural than intelligent, and more earnest than elegant, it will be none the less eloquent with God. There is a mighty power in a child's cry to prevail with a parent's heart. "Give ear unto my prayer." Some repetitions are not vain. The reduplication here used is neither superstition nor tautology, but is like the repeated blow of a hammer hitting the same nail on the head to fix it the more effectually, or the continued knocking of a beggar at the gate who cannot be denied an alms. "That goeth not out of feigned lips." Sincerity is a sine qu non in prayer. Lips of deceit are detestable to man and much more to God. In intercourse so hallowed as that of prayer, hypocrisy even in the remotest degree is as fatal as it is foolish. Hypocritical piety is double iniquity. He who would feign and flatter had better try his craft with a fool like himself, for to deceive the all-seeing One is as impossible as to take the moon in a net, or to lead the sun into a snare. He who would deceive God is himself already most grossly deceived. Our sincerity in prayer has no merit in it, any more than the earnestness of a mendicant in the street; but at the same time the Lord has regard to it, through Jesus, and will not long refuse his ear to an honest and fervent petitioner.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a><p>"Let my sentence come forth from thy presence." The Psalmist has now grown bold by the strengthening influence of prayer, and he now entreats the Judge of all the earth to give sentence upon his case. He had been libelled, basely and maliciously libelled; and having brought his action before the highest court, he, like an innocent man, has no desire to escape the enquiry, but even invites and sues for judgment. He does not ask for secrecy, but would have the result come forth to the world. He would have sentence pronounced and executed forthwith. In some matters we may venture to be as bold as this; but except we can plead something better than our own supposed innocence, it were terrible presumption thus to challenge the judgment of a sin-hating God. With Jesus as our complete and all-glorious righteousness we need not fear, though the day of judgment should commence at once, and hell open her mouth at our feet, but might joyfully prove the truth of our hymn writer's holy boast - <p>"Bold shall I stand in that great day;<p>For who ought to my charge shall lay?<p>While, through thy blood, absolved Iam<p>From sin's tremendous curse and shame."<p>continued...David being now grievously persecuted and distressed by Saul and other enemies, and being also bespattered with many calumnies, he appeals to the heart-searching God, makes a solemn protestation of his integrity, earnestly begs of God protection and deliverances; and being made weary of this life by his pressing and manifold calamities, he comforts himself with the contemplation and hope of a happier life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>David, in confidence of his integrity, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/17-1.htm" title="Hear the right, O LORD, attend to my cry, give ear to my prayer, that goes not out of feigned lips....">Psalm 17:1-6</a></span>, prayeth to God for defence against his enemies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/17-7.htm" title="Show your marvelous loving kindness, O you that save by your right hand them which put their trust in you from those that rise up against them....">Psalm 17:7-9</a></span>.

The psalmist appeals to the Lord as a Judge, sitting on the throne judging right, that he would hear his cause litigated between him and his adversaries, determine and give the decisive sentence about it; so Christ committed himself to him that judgeth righteously, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>; for by "right" may be meant his right and cause, or his righteous cause, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a>; unless rather his righteous prayer should be intended, so the Targum paraphrases it, "my prayer in righteousness"; not presented for the sake of his own righteousness, but on account of the righteousness of Christ, and for the vindication of his righteous cause before men: the Vulgate Latin, Ethiopic, and Arabic versions, render it "my righteousness", meaning his righteous cause; but rather the word may be rendered "righteousness" (z), or the "righteous one", and may design the psalmist himself, who was a righteous person, and such the Lord hears; or Christ, whose name is the Lord our righteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; and who, as an advocate or intercessor for himself and for his people, is Jesus Christ the righteous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>.

The lines have fallen to him in a charming district, viz., in the pleasurable fellowship of God, this most blessed domain of love has become his paradisaic possession. With &#1488;&#1507; he rises from the fact to the perfect contentment which it secures to him: such a heritage seems to him to be fair, he finds a source of inward pleasure and satisfaction in it. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; - according to Ew. 173, d, lengthened from the construct form &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514; (like &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>); according to Hupfeld, springing from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; (by the same apocope that is so common in Syriac, perhaps like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a> from &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) just like &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> - is rather, since in the former view there is no law for the change of vowel and such an application of the form as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-13.htm">Psalm 60:13</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-13.htm">Psalm 108:13</a>) is opposed to the latter, a stunted form of &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;: the heritage  equals  such a heritage pleases me, lit., seems fair to me (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;, cognate root &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;, cognate in meaning &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, Arab. bs&#774;r, to rub, polish, make shining, intr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512; to be shining, beautiful). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; of beauty known and felt by him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-36.htm">1 Samuel 25:36</a> &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, and the later way of expressing it <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-32.htm">Daniel 3:32</a>). But since the giver and the gift are one and the same, the joy he has in the inheritance becomes of itself a constant thanksgiving to and blessing of the Giver, that He (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; quippe qui) has counselled him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-24.htm">Psalm 73:24</a>) to choose the one thing needful, the good part. Even in the night-seasons his heart keeps watch, even then his reins admonish him (&#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;, here of moral incitement, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>, to warn). The reins are conceived of as the seat of the blessed feeling that Jahve is his possession (vid., Psychol. S. 268; tr. p. 316). He is impelled from within to offer hearth-felt thanks to his merciful and faithful God. He has Jahve always before him, Jahve is the point towards which he constantly directs his undiverted gaze; and it is easy for him to have Him thus ever present, for He is &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (supply &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>), at my right hand (i.e., where my right hand begins, close beside me), so that he has no need to draw upon his power of imagination.
