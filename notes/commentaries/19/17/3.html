Feigned prayers are fruitless; but if our hearts lead our prayers, God will meet them with his favour. The psalmist had been used to pray, so that it was not his distress and danger that now first brought him to his duty. And he was encouraged by his faith to expect God would notice his prayers. Constant resolution and watchfulness against sins of the tongue, will be a good evidence of our integrity. Aware of man's propensity to wicked works, and of his own peculiar temptations, David had made God's word his preservative from the paths of Satan, which lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very lead to destruction. If we carefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very comfortable in the reflection, when we are in trouble. Those that are, through grace, going in God's paths, should pray that their goings may be held up in those paths. David prays, Lord, still hold me up. Those who would proceed and persevere in the ways of God, must, by faith prayer, get daily fresh supplies of grace and strength from him. Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, distinguishing favours, not common mercies, but be gracious to me; do as thou usest to do to those who love thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast proved mine heart - In this verse he refers to his own character and life in the matter under consideration, or the consciousness of his own innocence in respect to his fellow-men who are persecuting and opposing him. He appeals to the Great Searcher of hearts in proof that, in this respect, he was innocent; and he refers to different forms of trial on the part of God to show that after the most thorough search he would find, and did find, that in these respects he was an innocent man, and that his enemies had no occasion to treat him as they had done. It is still to be borne in mind here that the trial which the psalmist asks at the hand of God was not to prove that he was innocent toward him, or that he had a claim to His favor on account of his own personal holiness, but it was that he was innocent of any wrong toward those who were persecuting him, or, in other words, that after the most searching trial, even by his Maker, it would be found that he had given them no cause for treating him thus. The word here rendered "proved" means "to try, to prove, to examine," especially metals, to test their genuineness. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9-10</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>, note. The psalmist here says that God had tried or searched "his heart." He knew all his motives. He had examined all his desires and his thoughts. The psalmist felt assured that, after the most thorough trial, even God would not find anything in his heart that would justify the conduct of his enemies toward him.<p>Thou hast visited me - That is, for the purpose of inspecting my character, or of examining me. The English word "visit," like the Hebrew, is often used to denote a visitation for the purpose of inspection and examination. The idea is, that God had come to him for the very purpose of "examining" his character.<p>In the night - In solitude. In darkness. When I was alone. In the time when the thoughts are less under restraint than they are when surrounded by others. In a time when it can be seen what we really are; when we do not put on appearances to deceive others.<p>Thou hast tried me - The word used here - &#1510;&#1512;&#1507;  tsa&#770;raph - means properly "to melt, to smelt," etc., metals, or separating the pure metal from the dross. The meaning is, that God, in examining into his character, had subjected him to a trial as searching as that employed in purifying metals by casting them into the fire.<p>And shalt find nothing - Thou wilt find nothing that could give occasion for the conduct of my enemies. The future tense is used here to denote that, even if the investigation were continued, God would find nothing in his heart or in his conduct that would warrant their treatment of him. He had the most full and settled determination not to do wrong to them in any respect whatever. Nothing had been found in him that would justify their treatment of him; he was determined so to live, and he felt assured that he would so live, that nothing of the kind would be found in him in time to come. "I am purposed." I am fully resolved.<p>My mouth shall not transgress - Transgress the law of God, or go beyond what is right. That is, I will utter nothing which is wrong, or which can give occasion for their harsh and unkind treatment. Much as he had been provoked and injured, he was determined not to retaliate, or to give occasion for their treating him in the manner in which they were now doing. Prof. Alexander renders this "My mouth shall not exceed my thought; "but the common version gives a better idea, and is sanctioned by the Hebrew.

So this general phrase is to be limited from the context, as other generals most frequently are.

Some join these words with the next foregoing, and render the place thus, That which <span class="ital">I have thought, my mouth shall not transgress</span>, or rather, <span class="ital">hath not transgressed</span>, i.e. my thoughts and words always agree together.

This properly belongs to God, who is the searcher of the heart and reins, and is desired by all good men; and though God has no need to make use of any means to know the heart, and what is in it; yet in order to know, or rather to make known, what is in the hearts of his people, he proves them sometimes by adversity, as he did Abraham and Job, and sometimes by prosperity, by mercies given forth in a wonderful way, as to the Israelites in the wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>; sometimes by suffering false prophets and false teachers to be among them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-3.htm">Deuteronomy 13:3</a>; and sometimes by leaving corruptions in them, and them to their corruptions, as he left the Canaanites in the land, and as he left Hezekiah to his own heart, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-22.htm">Judges 2:22</a>. In one or other or more of these ways God proved the heart of David, and found him to be a man after his own heart; and in the first of these ways he proved Christ, who was found faithful to him that appointed him, and was a man approved of God; <p>thou hast visited me in the night; God visited and redeemed his people in the night of Jewish darkness; he visits and calls them by his grace in the night of unregeneracy; and so he visits with his gracious presence in the night of desertion; and he often visits by granting counsel, comfort, and support, in the night of affliction, which seems to be intended here; thus he visited the human nature of Christ in the midst of his sorrows and sufferings, when it was the Jews' hour and power of darkness. Elsewhere God is said to visit every morning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-18.htm">Job 7:18</a>; <p>thou hast tried me; as silver and gold are tried in the furnace; thus the people of God, and their graces in them, are tried by afflictions; so David was tried, and in this manner Christ himself was tried; wherefore he is called the tried stone, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <p>and shalt find nothing; or "shalt not find": which is variously supplied; some "thy desire", or what is well pleasing to thee, so Jarchi; or "thou hast not found me innocent", as Kimchi; others supply it quite the reverse, "and iniquity is not found in me", as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions; or "thou hast not found iniquity in me", as the Syriac and Arabic versions; to which agrees the Chaldee paraphrase, "and thou hast not found corruption"; which must be understood, not as if there was no sin and corruption in David; for he often makes loud complaints and large confessions of his sins, and earnestly prays for the forgiveness of them; but either that there was no sin in his heart which he regarded, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a>; which he nourished and cherished, which he indulged and lived in; or rather there was no such crime found in him, which his enemies charged him with; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>.

The lines have fallen to him in a charming district, viz., in the pleasurable fellowship of God, this most blessed domain of love has become his paradisaic possession. With &#1488;&#1507; he rises from the fact to the perfect contentment which it secures to him: such a heritage seems to him to be fair, he finds a source of inward pleasure and satisfaction in it. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; - according to Ew. 173, d, lengthened from the construct form &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1514; (like &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm">Psalm 61:1</a>); according to Hupfeld, springing from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; (by the same apocope that is so common in Syriac, perhaps like &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a> from &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) just like &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> - is rather, since in the former view there is no law for the change of vowel and such an application of the form as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-13.htm">Psalm 60:13</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-13.htm">Psalm 108:13</a>) is opposed to the latter, a stunted form of &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492;: the heritage  equals  such a heritage pleases me, lit., seems fair to me (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;, cognate root &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;, &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;, cognate in meaning &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, Arab. bs&#774;r, to rub, polish, make shining, intr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512; to be shining, beautiful). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; of beauty known and felt by him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-36.htm">1 Samuel 25:36</a> &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, and the later way of expressing it <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-32.htm">Daniel 3:32</a>). But since the giver and the gift are one and the same, the joy he has in the inheritance becomes of itself a constant thanksgiving to and blessing of the Giver, that He (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; quippe qui) has counselled him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-24.htm">Psalm 73:24</a>) to choose the one thing needful, the good part.

The reins are conceived of as the seat of the blessed feeling that Jahve is his possession (vid., Psychol. S. 268; tr. p. 316). He is impelled from within to offer hearth-felt thanks to his merciful and faithful God. He has Jahve always before him, Jahve is the point towards which he constantly directs his undiverted gaze; and it is easy for him to have Him thus ever present, for He is &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (supply &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-20.htm">Psalm 55:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>), at my right hand (i.e., where my right hand begins, close beside me), so that he has no need to draw upon his power of imagination.
