Now, Lord, shall men of this character, men so unreasonable, so unwise, so sottish; men so earthly, so sensual, so grovelling, so like the beasts that perish; shall men of this sort be supported and countenanced against those that honour thee, by preferring thy favour, and the enjoyment of thee, before all the wealth, and honour, and pleasures of this world? <span class="ital">Whose belly thou fillest — </span>That is, whose mind or appetite thou satisfiest, <span class="ital">with thy hid treasure, </span>that is, not only with common mercies, such as food and raiment, but with the choicest of earthly things, such as men are wont to hide or keep in their treasures; with wealth, and glory, and all the delights and comforts of the present life: “whom thou permittest to enjoy thy temporal blessings in abundance, as if it were to convince us in what estimation we ought to hold the world when we see the largest shares of it dealt out to the most worthless of the sons of Adam.” <span class="ital">They are full of children — </span>While many of thy faithful servants are barren, these are blessed with a numerous posterity.

This prayer is a prediction that Christ would be preserved, through all the hardships and difficulties of his humiliation, to the glories and joys of his exalted state, and is a pattern to Christians to commit the keeping of their souls to God, trusting him to preserve them to his heavenly kingdom. Those are our worst enemies, that are enemies to our souls. They are God's sword, which cannot move without him, and which he will sheathe when he has done his work with it. They are his hand, by which he chastises his people. There is no fleeing from God's hand, but by fleeing to it. It is very comfortable, when we are in fear of the power of man, to see it dependent upon, and in subjection to the power of God. Most men look on the things of this world as the best things; and they look no further, nor show any care to provide for another life. The things of this world are called treasures, they are so accounted; but to the soul, and when compared with eternal blessings, they are trash. The most afflicted Christian need not envy the most prosperous men of the world, who have their portion in this life. Clothed with Christ's righteousness, having through his grace a good heart and a good life, may we by faith behold God's face, and set him always before us. When we awake every morning, may we be satisfied with his likeness set before us in his word, and with his likeness stamped upon us by his renewing grace. Happiness in the other world is prepared only for those that are justified and sanctified: they shall be put in possession of it when the soul awakes, at death, out of its slumber in the body, and when the body awakes, at the resurrection, out of its slumber in the grave. There is no satisfaction for a soul but in God, and in his good will towards us, and his good work in us; yet that satisfaction will not be perfect till we come to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From men which are thy hand - Margin, "From men by thy hand." Here the rendering in the common version would be still more harsh than in the previous verse, since it is at least unusual to call men "the hand" of God, in the sense that they are his instruments in accomplishing his purposes. The more obvious construction is to regard it as a prayer that God would deliver him by his own hand from "men" - from men that rose up against him. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-14.htm">2 Samuel 24:14</a>.<p>From men of the world - A better construction of this would be "from men; from the world." The psalmist prays first that he may be delivered from men by the hand of God. He then "repeats" the prayer, "from men, I say," and then adds, "from the world." He desires to be rescued entirely from such worldly plans, devices, purposes; from people among whom nothing but worldly principles prevail.<p>Which have their portion in this life - Their portion - their lot - is among "the living;" that is, they have nothing to look forward to - to hope for in the world to come. They are, therefore, governed wholly by worldly principles. They have no fear of God; they have no regard to the rights of others further than will be in accordance with their own worldly interest. People whose portion is wholly in this life will make everything subordinate to their worldly interests.<p>And whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure - The meaning of this portion of the verse is that, in respect to the object for which they lived, they were successful. They lived only for the world, and they obtained what the world had to bestow. They had prosperity in their purposes in life. The word "hid" here - "hid treasure" - means that which is hoarded, secreted, carefully guarded; and the word commonly refers to the practice of secreting from public view valuable treasures, as silver and gold. It is possible, however, that the reference here is to the fact that God has hidden these objects in the depths of the earth, and that it is necessary to "search" for them carefully if men would obtain them. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-1.htm">Job 28:1-11</a>. The phrase "whose belly thou hast filled" means that their appetite or cravings in this respect were satisfied. They had what they wanted.<p>They are full of children - Margin, "their children are full." The margin probably expresses the sense of the Hebrew better than the text. The literal rendering would be, "satisfied are their sons;" that is, they have enough to satisfy the wants of their children. The expression "they are full of children" is harsh and unnatural, and is not demanded by the original, or by the main thought in the passage. The obvious signification is, that they have enough for themselves and for their children.<p>And leave the rest of their substance to their babes - That is, what remains after their own wants are supplied, they leave to their babes. They not only have enough for the supply of their own wants and the wants of their children during their own lives, but they also leave an inheritance to their children after they are dead. The word rendered "babes" properly means little children, though it seems here to be used as denoting children in general. The meaning is, that they are able to provide for their children after they themselves are dead.

Some understand these words, with what follows, as independent of the former, and of another set of men, even of good men; so the Targum, <p>"and the righteous who deliver their souls for thy sake, O Lord, unto death in the earth, their portion is in eternal life;'' <p>so Jarchi gives the like sense of them: but the words are to be connected with the preceding, as they are by Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech; and the sense is, deliver my soul from men, which are instruments in thine hand to chastise thy people: so even Satan himself, and the Sabeans and Chaldeans, whom he instigated to afflict Job, are called the "hand" of the Lord that touched him, because he suffered them to do what they did for the trial of him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-21.htm">Job 19:21</a>. The words may be rendered, "the men of thy hand" (m); who are raised up by thine hand to the power and dignity they have; and who can easily be pulled down by it; and who are in thine hand, and at thy beck and control, and whose wrath and fury thou canst restrain. Or they may be rendered, "from men by thy hand" (n); that is, deliver me from them by thy strong hand and mighty power; as Israel of old was delivered from the Egyptians by the strong and mighty hand of God; <p>from men of the world: who are, as they were when they came into the world, in sin, in darkness, and in a carnal and unregenerate state; who are not only in the world, but of it, and belong to it, and to it only; and are under the influence of the god of the world, and are taken with the lusts and pleasures of it, and live in them and serve them: and are of worldly spirits, inordinately love the things of the world, mind earth and earthly things, and are unconcerned about the things of another world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm">Luke 16:8</a>; <p>which have their portion in this life; and in this only; have a large share of the good things of this life; and which is all their portion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>; <p>and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: earthly treasure, as gold and silver, which is called hid treasure, because it is first hid in the bowels of the earth, out of which it is dug, and afterwards hid in the coffers of worldly men; and oftentimes kept to the hurt of the owners of it. Or the phrase may denote the value and preciousness of it. And to have the belly filled with this is to have a very great affluence and plenty of it; though it is very rare, let it be ever so large, that men are fully satisfied with it; <p>they are full of children; which among the eastern nations was reckoned a considerable part of outward prosperity and happiness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>; or their "children are full", or "filled" (o) with hidden treasure also; <p>and leave the rest of their substance to their babes; their children's children; their grandchildren, as Kimchi explains it; and which is said, not by way of complaint, as an evil in them, since it is lawful and right for parents to lay up for their children, and leave it to them: unless the sense is, that they engross all to themselves, and to their posterity, in life and death; while they live, they indulge their sensual appetites and lusts, and fill themselves and theirs, but give nothing to the poor and hungry; nor part with anything for the interest of God and true religion; and when they die leave nothing for such use and service, but all to their posterity: but rather the phrase is expressive of their great plenty; that having lived in and enjoyed great fulness themselves, and given large portions to their children, yet have much left; which, at death, they bequeath to the young generation. Now from such men in power and dignity, and from being hurt by them, as well as from communion and conversation with them, the psalmist desires to be delivered; and expresses his satisfaction in other and better things than they enjoy, in the following words. <p>(m)  "ab inimieis manus tuae", V.

The apple of the eye, which is surrounded by the iris, is called &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, the man (Arabic insa&#770;n), or in the diminutive and endearing sense of the termination on: the little man of the eye, because a picture in miniature of one's self is seen, as in a glass, when looking into another person's eye. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; either because it is as if born out of the eye and the eye has, as it were, concentrated itself in it, or rather because the little image which is mirrored in it is, as it were, the little daughter of the eye (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a>). To the Latin pupilla (pupula), Greek &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;, corresponds most closely &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>, which does not signify the gate, aperture, sight, but, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; shows, the little boy, or more strictly, the little girl of the eye. It is singular that &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; here has the feminine &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; as the expression in apposition to it. The construction might be genitival: "as the little man of the apple of the eye," inasmuch as the saint knows himself to be so near to God, that, as it were, his image in miniature is mirrored in the great eye of God. But (1) the more ozdinary name for the pupil of the eye is not &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, but &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;; and (2) with that construction the proper point of the comparison, that the apple of the eye is an object of the most careful self-preservation, is missed. There is, consequently, a combination of two names of the pupil or apple of the eye, the usual one and one more select, without reference to the gender of the former, in order to give greater definition and emphasis to the figure. The primary passage for this bold figure, which is the utterance of loving entreaty, is <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>, where the dazzling anthropomorphism is effaced by the lxx and other ancient versions; <p>(Note: Vid., Geiger, Urschrift und Ueberstezungen der Bibel, S. 324.)<p>cf. also Sir. 17:22. Then follows another figure, taken from the eagle, which hides its young under its wings, likewise from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, viz., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-11.htm">Psalm 17:11</a>, for the figure of the hen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>) is alien to the Old Testament. In that passage, Moses, in his great song, speaks of the wings of God; but the double figure of the shadow of God's wings (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>) is coined by David. "God's wings" are the spreadings out, i.e., the manifestations of His love, taking the creature under the protection of its intimate fellowship, and the "shadow" of these wings is the refreshing rest and security which the fellowship of this love affords to those, who hide themselves beneath it, from the heat of outward or inward conflict.<p>From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-9.htm">Psalm 17:9</a> we learn more definitely the position in which the psalmist is placed. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; signifies to use violence, to destroy the life, continuance, or possession of any one. According to the accentuation &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is to be connected with &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, not with &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;, and to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a> : "enemies with the soul" are those whose enmity is not merely superficial, but most deep-seated (cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). The soul (viz., the hating and eagerly longing soul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm">Psalm 41:3</a>) is just the same as if &#1489;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is combined with the verb, viz., the soul of the enemies; and &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; would therefore not be more correct, as Hitzig thinks, than &#1489;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, but would have a different meaning. They are eager to destroy him (perf. conatus), and form a circle round about him, as ravenous ones, in order to swallow him up. </body></html>
