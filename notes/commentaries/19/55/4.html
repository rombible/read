David praying. Prayer is a salve for every sore, and a relief to the spirit under every burden. 2. David weeping. Griefs are thus, in some measure, lessened, while those increase that have no vent given them. David in great alarm. We may well suppose him to be so, upon the breaking out of Absalom's conspiracy, and the falling away of the people. Horror overwhelmed him. Probably the remembrance of his sin in the matter of Uriah added much to the terror. When under a guilty conscience we must mourn in our complaint, and even strong believers have for a time been filled with horror. But none ever was so overwhelmed as the holy Jesus, when it pleased the Lord to put him to grief, and to make his soul an offering for our sins. In his agony he prayed more earnestly, and was heard and delivered; trusting in him, and following him, we shall be supported under, and carried through all trials. See how David was weary of the treachery and ingratitude of men, and the cares and disappointments of his high station: he longed to hide himself in some desert from the fury and fickleness of his people. He aimed not at victory, but rest; a barren wilderness, so that he might be quiet. The wisest and best of men most earnestly covet peace and quietness, and the more when vexed and wearied with noise and clamour. This makes death desirable to a child of God, that it is a final escape from all the storms and tempests of this world, to perfect and everlasting rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My heart is sore pained within me - Heavy and sad; that is, I am deeply afflicted. The word rendered is "sore pained," means properly to turn round; to twist; to dance in a circle; to be whirled round; and then to twist or writhe with pain, especially applied to a woman in travail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>. Here the idea is, that he was in deep distress and anguish. It is easy to see that this would be so, if the psalm refers to the revolt of Absalom. The ingratitude and rebellion of a son - the fact of being driven away from his throne - the number of his enemies - the unexpected news that Ahithophel was among them - and the entire uncertainty as to the result, justified the use of this strong language.<p>And the terrors of death are fallen upon me - The Septuagint, the Vulgate, and Luther, render this "the fear of death," as if he were afraid for his life, or afraid that the result of all this would be his death. A more natural construction, however, is to suppose that the reference is to the ordinary pains of death, and that he means to say that the pangs which he endured were like the pangs of death. The words "are fallen" suggest the idea that this had come suddenly upon him, like a "horror of great darkness" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>), or as if the gloomy shadow of death had suddenly crossed his path. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>. The calamities had come suddenly upon him; the conspiracy had been suddenly developed; and he had been suddenly driven away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/55.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5. express great alarm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/55.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My heart is sore pained within me; </span> with pains like those of a travailing woman, as the word signifies.

The attacks of his enemies (ver. 3) deeply grieve and pain the heart of the psalmist. It is not as if they were foreigners, whose hostility was to be expected. They are his own countrymen; one of them is his own familiar friend (ver. 12). Yet they threaten his life. And the terrors of death are fallen upon ms. When a king is the object of a conspiracy, he well knows, especially in the East, that nothing but his death will satisfy the conspirators. So on David, long before he made up his mind to quit Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>), the "terrors of death" must have fallen. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/54.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 54:6-9) In this second half, the poet, in the certainty of being heard, rejoices in help, and makes a vow of thanksgiving. The &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497; is not meant to imply that God is one out of many who upheld his threatened life; but rather that He comes within the category of such, and fills it up in Himself alone, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>; and for the origin of this Beth essentiae, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-35.htm">Judges 11:35</a>.

In the rapid transition to invocation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a> the end of the Psalm announces itself. The truth of God is not described as an instrumental agent of the cutting off, but as an impelling cause. It is the same Beth as in the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>): by or out of free impulse. These free-will sacrifices are not spiritual here in opposition to the ritual sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>), but ritual as an outward representation of the spiritual. The subject of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; is the Name of God; the post-biblical language, following <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>, calls God straightway &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, and passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a> and the one before us come very near to this usage. The praeterites mention the ground of the thanksgiving. What David now still hopes for will then lie behind him in the past.
