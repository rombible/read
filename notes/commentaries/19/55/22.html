He directs his speech to himself, or to his own soul, as he often does in this book, and withal to all good men in like circumstances. The word <span class="greekheb">יהבךְ</span>, <span class="ital">jehabecha, </span>however, here rendered <span class="ital">thy burden, </span>properly means, <span class="ital">thy gift, </span>or <span class="ital">portion: </span>for even the afflictions, trials, and troubles of good men are God’s gifts to them, and are termed such in Scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;">Php 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm" title="Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?">John 18:11</a>. Or, he may intend gifts of another kind, namely, such as are agreeable and pleasing to us; and then his meaning is, Whatever blessings God has given thee to enjoy, commit to his custody, and use to his glory; and particularly commit the keeping of thy soul to him. Or, Whatever it is that thou desirest God should give thee, leave it to him to give it thee in his own way and time. The version of the LXX. is excellent, <span class="greekheb">επιρριψον επι Κυριον την μεριμναν σου</span>. <span class="ital">Throw, </span>or <span class="ital">cast, upon the Lord thy care; </span>to which St. Peter refers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm" title="Casting all your care on him; for he cares for you.">1 Peter 5:7</a>. Care is a burden to many, which depresses their spirits. This burden we should learn to cast upon God by faith and prayer, committing our ways and works to him, and saying, Let him do what seemeth him good, and I shall be satisfied. To cast our burden upon the Lord, is to stay ourselves on his providence and promise, and to be very easy in the assurance that all shall work for good. <span class="ital">And he shall sustain thee — </span>Both support or bear thee up, and supply thy wants. He has not promised immediately to free us from the trouble which gives rise to our cares and fears, but he will strengthen our spirits by his Spirit, so that they shall not sink under the trial, and he will provide that we be not tempted above what we are able, and that as our day is our strength shall be. The LXX. render it, <span class="greekheb">αυτος σε</span>, <span class="greekheb">διαθρεψει</span>, <span class="ital">he himself shall nourish thee, </span>shall supply thy every need, according to his riches in glory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm" title="But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.">Php 4:19</a>.

He shall hear us, and not blame us for coming too often; the oftener the more welcome. David had thought all were against him; but now he sees there were many with him, more than he supposed; and the glory of this he gives to God, for it is he that raises us up friends, and makes them faithful to us. There are more true Christians, and believers have more real friends, than in their gloomy hours they suppose. His enemies should be reckoned with, and brought down; they could not ease themselves of their fears, as David could, by faith in God. Mortal men, though ever so high and strong, will easily be crushed by an eternal God. Those who are not reclaimed by the rod of affliction, will certainly be brought down to the pit of destruction. The burden of afflictions is very heavy, especially when attended with the temptations of Satan; there is also the burden of sin and corruption. The only relief under it is, to look to Christ, who bore it. Whatever it is that thou desirest God should give thee, leave it to him to give it in his own way and time. Care is a burden, it makes the heart stoop. We must commit our ways and works to the Lord; let him do as seemeth him good, and let us be satisfied. To cast our burden upon God, is to rest upon his providence and promise. And if we do so, he will carry us in the arms of his power, as a nurse carries a child; and will strengthen our spirits by his Spirit, so that they shall sustain the trial. He will never suffer the righteous to be moved; to be so shaken by any troubles, as to quit their duty to God, or their comfort in him. He will not suffer them to be utterly cast down. He, who bore the burden of our sorrows, desires us to leave to him to bear the burden of our cares, that, as he knows what is best for us, he may provide it accordingly. Why do not we trust Christ to govern the world which he redeemed?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cast thy burden upon the Lord - This may be regarded as an address of the psalmist to himself, or to his own soul - an exhortation to himself to roll all his care upon the Lord, and to be calm. It is expressed, however, in so general language, that it may be applicable to all persons in similar circumstances. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>. The Margin here is, "gift." The "literal" rendering would be, "Cast upon Jehovah what he hath given (or laid upon) thee; that is, thy lot." (Gesenius, Lexicon) The phrase, "he gives thee," here means what he appoints for thee; what he allots to thee as thy portion; what, in the great distribution of things in his world, he has assigned to "thee" to be done or to be borne; cast it all on him. Receive the allotment as coming from him; as what "he" has, in his infinite wisdom, assigned to thee as thy portion in this life; as what "he" has judged it to be best that then shouldest do or bear; as "thy" part of toil, or trouble, or sacrifice, in carrying out his great arrangements in the world. All that is to be "borne" or to be "done" in this world he has "divided up" among people, giving or assigning to each one what He thought best suited to his ability, his circumstances, his position in life - what "he" could do or bear best - and what, therefore, would most conduce to the great end in view. That portion thus assigned to "us," we are directed to "cast upon the Lord;" that is, we are to look to him to enable us to do or to bear it. As it is "his" appointment, we should receive it, and submit to it, without complaining; as it is "his" appointment, we may feel assured that no more has been laid upon us than is commensurate with our ability, our condition, our usefulness, our salvation. We have not to rearrange what has been thus appointed, or to adjust it anew, but to do all, and endure all that he has ordained, leaning on his arm.<p>And he shall sustain thee - He will make you sufficient for it. The word literally means "to measure;" then to hold or contain, as a vessel or measure; and then, to hold up or sustain "by" a sufficiency of strength or nourishment, as life is sustained. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-11.htm">Genesis 45:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-12.htm">Genesis 47:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-21.htm">Genesis 50:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4</a>. Here it means that God would give such a "measure" of strength and grace as would be adapted to the duty or the trial; or such as would be sufficient to bear us up under it. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>.<p>He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved - literally, "He will not give moving forever to the righteous." That is, he will not so appoint, arrange, or permit things to occur, that the righteous shall be "ultimately" and "permanently" removed from their steadfastness and their hope; he will not suffer them to fall away and perish. In all their trials and temptations he will sustain them, and will ultimately bring them off in triumph. The meaning here cannot be that the righteous shall never be "moved" in the sense that their circumstances will not be changed; or that none of their plans will fail; or that they will never be disappointed; or that their minds will never in any sense be discomposed; but that whatever trials may come upon them, they will be "ultimately" safe.

Thy bread shall be given thee, thy waters shall be sure. Abundant nourishment shall fit thee to bear all thy labours and trials. As thy days so shall thy strength be. "He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved." He may move like the boughs of a tree in the tempest, but he shall never be moved like a tree torn up by the roots. He stands firm who stands in God. Many would destroy the saints, but God has not suffered it, and never will.

These are either the words of the Holy Ghost to David, according to Jarchi; or of David to his own soul in distress, and may be directed to any good man in like circumstances. The word rendered "burden" signifies a gift and so the words are translated by many, "cast thy gift upon the Lord" (f); what he has given in a way of providence and of grace, acknowledge him to be the author of it; pray for a continuance of mercies, and for fresh supplies, and expect them; and also what he gives in a way of trial, the cross, with all afflictions and troubles: which sense seems most agreeable to the context; and these may be said to be "the gift" of God, as the cup of sorrow Christ drank of is said to be "given" him by his Father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>. These are given by the Lord to bring his people to a sense of sin, and acknowledgment of it; to humble them for it, and cause them to return from it; and to try their graces: and then do they cast them upon him, when they acknowledge them as coming from him; wait the removal of them in his time; desire a sanctified use of them, and expect deliverance from them by him. Or the sense is, whatever thou desirest should be given thee by the Lord, cast it on him; that is, leave it with him to do as he pleases, who works all things after the counsel of his own will. The Targum renders it, <p>"cast thy hope upon the Lord;'' <p>as an anchor on a good bottom, to which hope is compared, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>. This is done when persons make the Lord the object of their hope, and expect all from him they hope to enjoy here and hereafter. The Septuagint version is, "cast thy care upon the Lord"; of thy body, and all the temporal concerns of thy family, and everything relating thereunto; and of thy soul, and its everlasting welfare and salvation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>. But Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and Kimchi, interpret the word by  "thy burden", which is learnt from the use of it in the Arabic language. The Rabbins did not know the meaning of the word, till one of them heard an Arabian merchant say (g), <p>"take up  "thy burden", and cast it upon the camels.'' <p>The burden here meant is either the burden of afflictions, which is sometimes very heavy; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-23.htm">Job 6:23</a>; no affliction is joyous, but grievous; but some are heavier in their own kind and nature than others, and become so through the multiplicity of them, as in the case of Job; or through the long continuance of them, and especially when attended with the hidings of God's face, or with the temptations of Satan: or else the burden of sin and corruption, which is an heavy burden, and a very disagreeable one; under which the saints groan, and by which they are hindered in running their Christian race, and which they are like to carry with them to their graves; their only relief under it is to look to Christ, who has borne it and took it away; which may be meant by casting it on the Lord: <p>and he shall sustain thee; in being, both natural and spiritual; and supply with all things necessary both to the temporal and spiritual life, and support under all trials and difficulties; <p>he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved; to be shaken and stagger so as to fall, especially totally and finally; for the words may be rendered, "he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved for ever" (h); or so to be moved by their afflictions as to desert the cause in which they are engaged; nor shall they ever be moved by men or devils, or anything whatever, from their spiritual estate, in which they are by grace; nor from the love of God and covenant of grace; nor out of the hands of Christ; nor from their state of justification, adoption, and sanctification. <p>(f) "donum tuum", Montanus; "quicquid dat tibi", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

The LXX, from which St Peter borrows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm" title="Casting all your care on him; for he cares for you.">1 Peter 5:7</a>), renders <span class="ital">thy care</span>. But for this explanation there is no philological ground, and the word seems rather to mean <span class="ital">that which he hath given thee</span>, the burden of care or suffering which He hath laid upon thee to bear. <span class="ital">He shall sustain thee</span>, not necessarily removing the burden, but giving strength to bear it, upholding thee lest thou shouldest fall under its weight.

The form of the sentence would then resemble <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm" title="He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.">Psalm 22:8</a>. But the reading is scarcely probable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved</span>] We must either understand <span class="ital">moved</span> of final and fatal disaster, or else render, <span class="ital">He will not suffer the righteous to be moved for ever:</span> though they may be in distress for awhile, there will be an end to their suffering. For the phrase cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-6.htm" title="He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.">Psalm 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-4.htm" title="Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.">Psalm 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-6.htm" title="And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.">Psalm 30:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22, 23</span>.

The narrative in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a> shows how passively David looked on at this movement, until he abandoned the palace of his own free will and quitted Jerusalem  The espionage in the circuit of the city is contrasted with the movements going on within the city itself by the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;.

The suffix of &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; is in this instance not subjective as in the &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498; of the law respecting the asham or trespass-offering: according to my estimation, but objectively: equal to the worth at which I am estimated, that is to say, equally valued with myself. What heart-piercing significance this word obtains when found in the mouth of the second David, who, although the Son of God and peerless King, nevertheless entered into the most intimate human relationship as the Son of man to His disciples, and among them to that Iscariot! &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; from &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, Arabic alifa, to be accustomed to anything, assuescere, signifies one attached to or devoted to any one; and &#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;, according to the Hebrew meaning of the verb &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, an intimate acquaintance. The first of the relative clauses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a> describes their confidential private intercourse; the second the unrestrained manifestation of it in public. &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a> (vid., supra on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>). &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, to make friendly intercourse sweet, is equivalent to cherishing it. &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; stands over against &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, just like &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, secret counsel, and &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, loud tumult, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>. Here &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; is just the same as that which the Korahitic poet calls &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1495;&#1493;&#1490;&#1490; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>.<p>In the face of the faithless friends who has become the head of the Absalomite faction David now breaks out, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>, into fearful imprecations. The Chethb is &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, desolationes (super eos); but this word occurs only in the name of a place ("House of desolations"), and does not well suit such direct reference to persons. On the other hand, the Ker &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, let death ensnare or impose upon them, gives a sense that is not to be objected to; it is a pregnant expression, equivalent to: let death come upon them unexpectedly. To this &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488; corresponds the &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the second imprecation: let them go down alive into Hades (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, perhaps originally &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, the &#1492; of which may have been lost beside the &#1495; that follows), i.e., like the company of Korah, while their life is yet vigorous, that is to say, let them die a sudden, violent death. The drawing together of the decipiat (opprimat) mors into one word is the result of the ancient scriptio continua and of the defective mode of writing, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;, like &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a>, &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>. Bttcher renders it differently: let death crash in upon them; but the future form &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497; is an imaginary one, which cannot be supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>. Hitzig renders it: let death benumb them (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;); but this gives an inconceivable figure, with the turgidity of which the trepidantes Manes in Virgil, Aenid viii. 246, do not admit of comparison. In the confirmation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, together with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; which follows, does not pretend to be any advance in the thought, whether &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; be rendered a settlement, dwelling, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (lxx, Targum), or an assembly (Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome). Hence Hitzig's rendering: in their shrine, in their breast ( equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>), &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; being short for &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501; in accordance with the love of contraction which prevails in poetry (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>). But had the poet intended to use this figure he would have written &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1501;, and is not the assertion that wickedness is among them, that it is at home in them, really a climax? The change of the names of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a> is significant. He calls upon Him who is exalted above the world, and He who mercifully interposes in the history of the world helps him. </body></html>
