David praying. Prayer is a salve for every sore, and a relief to the spirit under every burden. 2. David weeping. Griefs are thus, in some measure, lessened, while those increase that have no vent given them. David in great alarm. We may well suppose him to be so, upon the breaking out of Absalom's conspiracy, and the falling away of the people. Horror overwhelmed him. Probably the remembrance of his sin in the matter of Uriah added much to the terror. When under a guilty conscience we must mourn in our complaint, and even strong believers have for a time been filled with horror. But none ever was so overwhelmed as the holy Jesus, when it pleased the Lord to put him to grief, and to make his soul an offering for our sins. In his agony he prayed more earnestly, and was heard and delivered; trusting in him, and following him, we shall be supported under, and carried through all trials. See how David was weary of the treachery and ingratitude of men, and the cares and disappointments of his high station: he longed to hide himself in some desert from the fury and fickleness of his people. He aimed not at victory, but rest; a barren wilderness, so that he might be quiet. The wisest and best of men most earnestly covet peace and quietness, and the more when vexed and wearied with noise and clamour. This makes death desirable to a child of God, that it is a final escape from all the storms and tempests of this world, to perfect and everlasting rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Attend unto me, and hear me - This also is the language of earnest supplication, as if he was afraid that God would not regard his cry. These varied forms of speech show the intense earnestness of the psalmist, and his deep conviction that he must have help from God.<p>I mourn - The word used here - &#1512;&#1493;&#1491;  ru&#770;d - means properly to wander about; to ramble - especially applied to animals that have broken loose; and then, to inquire after, to seek, as one does "by running up and down;" hence, to desire, to wish. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-12.htm">Hosea 11:12</a> - "Judah runs wild toward God," - in our translation, "Judah yet ruleth with God." The word occurs also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>, "We are lords" (margin, have dominion); and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>, "When thou shalt have the dominion." It is not elsewhere found in the Scriptures. The idea here seems not to be to mourn, but to inquire earnestly; to seek; to look for, as one does who wanders about, or who looks every way for help. David was in deep distress. He looked in every direction. He earnestly desired to find God as a Helper. He was in the condition of one who had lost his way, or who had lost what was most valuable to him; and he directed his eyes most earnestly toward God for help.<p>In my complaint - The word here employed commonly means speech, discourse, meditation. It here occurs in the sense of complaint, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-13.htm">Job 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm">Job 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-16.htm">1 Samuel 1:16</a>. It is not used, however, to denote complaint in the sense of fault-finding, but in the sense of deep distress. As the word is now commonly used, we connect with it the idea of fault-finding, complaining, accusing, or the idea that we have been dealt with unjustly. This is not the meaning in tills place, or in the Scriptures generally. It is the language of a troubled, not of an injured spirit.<p>And make a noise - To wit, by prayer; or, by groaning. The psalmist did not hesitate to give vent to his feelings by groans, or sobs, or prayers. Such expressions are not merely indications of deep feeling, but they are among the appointed means of relief. They are the effort which nature makes to throw off the burden, and if they are without complaining or impatience they are not wrong. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-11.htm">Isaiah 59:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/55.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

So as to answer, and that immediately and directly, his case requiring present help; <p>I mourn in my complaint; or "in my meditation" (p); solitary thoughts, and melancholy views of things. Saints have their complaints, on account of their sins and corruptions, their barrenness and unfruitfulness, and the decay of vital religion in them; and because of the low estate of Zion, the declining state of the interest of Christ, and the little success of his Gospel; and they mourn, in these complaints, over their own sins, and the sins of others, professors and profane, and under afflictions temporal and spiritual, both their own and the church's. Christ also, in the days of his flesh, had his complaints of the perverseness and faithlessness of the generation of men among whom he lived; of the frowardness, pride and contentions of his disciples; of the reproaches, insult, and injuries of his enemies; and of the dereliction of his God and Father; and he often mourned on account of one or other of these things, being a man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs; <p>and make a noise; not only with sighs and groans, but in so loud a manner as to be called roaring; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>. <p>(p) "in meditatione mea", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Gejerus, Michaelis; so Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/55.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/55.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">hear me</span>] Answer me.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I mourn</span> &c.] Render, I am restless in my complaint, and am distracted (R.V. moan).

The Name of God is the manifestation of His nature, which has mercy as its central point (for the Name of God is &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, v. 8, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-11.htm">Psalm 52:11</a>), so that &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; (which is here the parallel word to &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498;) is consequently equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498;. The obtaining of right for any one (&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>, and frequently, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>) is attributed to the all-conquering might of God, which is only one side of the divine Name, i.e., of the divine nature which manifests itself in the diversity of its attributes. &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-4.htm">Psalm 54:4</a>) is construed with &#1500; (cf. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-2.htm">Psalm 87:2</a>) like &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1494;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a>. The Targum, misled by <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a>, reads &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; instead of &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a>. The inscription leads one to think of the Ziphites in particular in connection with "strangers" and "violent men." The two words in most instances denote foreign enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-2.htm">Isaiah 25:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; but &#1494;&#1512; is also a stranger in the widest sense, regulated in each instance according to the opposite, e.g., the non-priest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>; and one's fellow-countrymen can also turn out to be &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-21.htm">Jeremiah 15:21</a>. The Ziphites, although Judaeans like David, might be called "strangers," because they had taken the side against David; and "violent men," because they pledged themselves to seize and deliver him up. Under other circumstances this might have been their duty as subjects. In this instance, however, it was godlessness, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a>) says. Any one at that time in Israel who feared God more than man, could not lend himself to be made a tool of Saul's blind fury. God had already manifestly enough acknowledged David. </body></html>
