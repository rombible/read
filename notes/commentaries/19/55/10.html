Let us not be surprised at the corruptions and disorders of the church on earth, but long to see the New Jerusalem. He complains of one that had been very industrious against him. God often destroys the enemies of the church by dividing them. And an interest divided against itself cannot long stand. The true Christian must expect trials from professed friends, from those with whom he has been united; this will be very painful; but by looking unto Jesus we shall be enabled to bear it. Christ was betrayed by a companion, a disciple, an apostle, who resembled Ahithophel in his crimes and doom. Both were speedily overtaken by Divine vengeance. And this prayer is a prophecy of the utter, the everlasting ruin, of all who oppose and rebel against the Messiah.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Day and night they go about it, upon the walls thereof - That is, continually. The word "they" in this place probably refers to the violence and strife mentioned in the preceding verse. They are here personified, and they seem to surround the city; to be everywhere moving, even on the very walls. They are like a besieging army. Inside and outside; in the midst of the city and on the walls, there was nothing but violence and strife - conspiracy, rebellion, and crime.<p>Mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it - Crime abounded, and the result was anguish or sorrow. This language would well describe the scenes when Absalom rebelled; when the city was filled with conspirators and rebels; and when crime and anguish seemed to prevail in every part of it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/55.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11. which is described in detail (compare Ps 7:14-16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/55.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They, </span> i.e. the violence and strife last mentioned, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-9.htm" title="Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.">Psalm 55:9</a></span>, go about it; do encompass it, and are as it were the garrison by which they design to defend it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon the walls thereof; </span> in the more outward parts, as also in the very midst of it, as it follows.

That is, "violence" and "strife" go about the walls of it continually; men of violence and contention are the only watchmen of it: a city must be sadly guarded that has no better watch than this; <p>mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it; it was full of wickedness within and without; the city, as Aben Ezra observes, was like a circle; violence and strife were as a line round about it, and mischief and sorrow the centre of it: and these two commonly go together; where mischief is, sorrow follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/55.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> mischief also and sorrow <i>are</i> in the midst of it.</span><p>(h) All laws and good orders are broken and only vice and dissolution reigns under Saul.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/55.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">they go about it upon the walls thereof</span>] A metaphor from watchmen going their rounds on the city walls. But who are meant by <span class="ital">they?</span> Perhaps the party hostile to the Psalmist, who are ever patrolling the city, on the alert for mischief. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-20.htm" title="For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:">Isaiah 29:20</a>. But perhaps rather Violence and Strife personified. These he implies with a bitter irony are the watchmen who are now in charge of order and safety in the city. This explanation agrees well with the following lines:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Iniquity also and Mischief are in the midst of it,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Destruction is in the midst thereof:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Oppression and Deceit depart not from her streets.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/55.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Day and night they go about it upon the walls</span> <span class="cmt_word">thereof.</span> "It is not a siege or blockade that is described; and the persons spoken of are not foreign, but native enemies. These are compared to watchmen  on the walls; only, instead of keeping watch against the enemy, they 'watch for iniquity' "(Cheyne). Mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it; rather, <span class="accented">iniquity also and trouble.</span> Compare the "violence and strife" of ver. 9. Society is disorganized. It is not only that wickedness prevails, but throughout the city there is violence and contention. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/55.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this first group sorrow prevails. David spreads forth his deep grief before God, and desires for himself some lonely spot in the wilderness far away from the home or lurking-place of the confederate band of those who are compassing his overthrow. "Veil not Thyself" here, where what is spoken of is something audible, not visible, is equivalent to "veil not Thine ear," <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-56.htm">Lamentations 3:56</a>, which He designedly does, when the right state of heart leaves the praying one, and consequently that which makes it acceptable and capable of being answered is wanting to the prayer (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; signifies a shrub (Syriac shucho, Arabic s&#780;&#305;&#770;h&#803;), and also reflection and care (Arabic, carefulness, attention; Aramaic, &#1505;&#1495;, to babble, talk, discourse). The Hiph. &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a> signifies to lead a roving life, has in this instance the signification to move one's self backwards and forwards, to be inwardly uneasy; root &#1512;&#1491;, Arab. rd, to totter, whence ra&#770;da, jaru&#770;da, to run up and down (IV to desire, will); raida, to shake (said of a soft bloated body); radda, to turn (whence taraddud, a moving to and fro, doubting); therefore: I wander hither and thither in my reflecting or meditating, turning restlessly from one thought to another. It is not necessary to read &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-4.htm">Psalm 77:4</a> instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, since the verb &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>, 12, is secured by the derivatives. Since these only exhibit &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, and not &#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (in Arabic used more particularly of the raving of love), &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, as also &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;, is Hiph., and in fact like this latter used with an inward object: I am obliged to raise a tumult or groan, break out into the dull murmuring sounds of pain. The cohortative not unfrequently signifies "I have to" or "I must" of incitements within one's self which are under the control of outward circumstances. In this restless state of mind he finds himself, and he is obliged to break forth into this cry of pain on account of the voice of the foe which he cannot but hear; by reason of the pressure or constraint (&#1506;&#1511;&#1514;) of the evil-doer which he is compelled to feel. The conjecture &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1514; (Olshausen and Hupfeld) is superfluous. &#1506;&#1511;&#1492; is a more elegant Aramaizing word instead of &#1510;&#1512;&#1492;.<p>The second strophe begins with a more precise statement of that which justifies his pain. The Hiph. &#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1496; signifies here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a> (Chethb), declinare: they cast or roll down evil (calamity) upon him and maliciously lay snares for him &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1507;, breathing anger against him who is conscious of having manifested only love towards them. His heart turns about in his body, it writhes (&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;); cf. on this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>. Fear and trembling take possession of his inward parts; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; in the expression &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;, as is always the case when followed by a tone syllable, is a so-called &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, i.e., it has the tone that has retreated to the penult. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-24.htm">Isaiah 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>), although this is only with difficulty discernible in our printed copies, and is therefore (vid., Accentsystem, vi. 2) noted with Mercha. The fut. consec. which follows introduces the heightened state of terror which proceeds from this crowding on of fear and trembling. Moreover, the wish that is thereby urged from him, which David uttered to himself, is introduced in the third strophe by a fut. consec.<p>(Note: That beautiful old song of the church concerning Jesus has grown out of this strophe: - <p>Ecquis binas columbinas<p>Alas dabit animae?<p>Et in almam crucis palmam<p>Evolat citissime, etc.)<p>"Who will give me?" is equivalent to "Oh that I had!" Ges. 136, 1. In &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is involved the self-satisfying signification of settling down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-13.htm">Ezekiel 31:13</a>), of coming to rest and remaining in a place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a>). Without going out of our way, a sense perfectly in accordance with the matter in hand may be obtained for &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496; &#1500;&#1497;, if &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is taken not as Kal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-12.htm">Psalm 71:12</a>), but after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-12.htm">Isaiah 60:12</a>, as Hiph.: I would hasten, i.e., quickly find for myself a place which might serve me as a shelter from the raging wind, from the storm. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1505;&#1506;&#1492; is equivalent to the Arabic rihin sa&#770;ijat-in, inasmuch as Arab. s&#8219;a&#770;, "to move one's self quickly, to go or run swiftly," can be said both of light (Koran, 66:8) and of water-brooks (vid., Jones, Comm. Poes. Asiat., ed. Lipsiae, p. 358), and also of strong currents of air, of winds, and such like. The correction &#1505;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, proposed by Hupfeld, produces a disfiguring tautology. Among those about David there is a wild movement going on which is specially aimed at his overthrow. From this he would gladly flee and hide himself, like a dove taking refuge in a cleft of the rock from the approaching storm, or from the talons of the bird of prey, fleeing with its noiseless but persevering flight.<p>(Note: Kimchi observes that the dove, when she becomes tired, draws in one wing and flies with the other, and thus the more surely escapes. Aben-Ezra finds an allusion here to the carrier-pigeon.) </body></html>
