David praying. Prayer is a salve for every sore, and a relief to the spirit under every burden. 2. David weeping. Griefs are thus, in some measure, lessened, while those increase that have no vent given them. David in great alarm. We may well suppose him to be so, upon the breaking out of Absalom's conspiracy, and the falling away of the people. Horror overwhelmed him. Probably the remembrance of his sin in the matter of Uriah added much to the terror. When under a guilty conscience we must mourn in our complaint, and even strong believers have for a time been filled with horror. But none ever was so overwhelmed as the holy Jesus, when it pleased the Lord to put him to grief, and to make his soul an offering for our sins. In his agony he prayed more earnestly, and was heard and delivered; trusting in him, and following him, we shall be supported under, and carried through all trials. See how David was weary of the treachery and ingratitude of men, and the cares and disappointments of his high station: he longed to hide himself in some desert from the fury and fickleness of his people. He aimed not at victory, but rest; a barren wilderness, so that he might be quiet. The wisest and best of men most earnestly covet peace and quietness, and the more when vexed and wearied with noise and clamour. This makes death desirable to a child of God, that it is a final escape from all the storms and tempests of this world, to perfect and everlasting rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because of the voice of the enemy - He now states the cause of his troubles. He had been, and was, unjustly treated by others. The particular idea in the word "voice" here is, that he was suffering from slanderous reproaches; from assaults which had been made on his character. He was charged with evil conduct, and the charge was made in such a manner that he could not meet it. The result was, that a series of calamities had come upon him which was quite overwhelming.<p>Because of the oppression of the wicked - The word here rendered "oppression" occurs nowhere else. The verb from which it is derived occurs twice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-13.htm">Amos 2:13</a> : "Behold, I am "pressed" under you as a cart is "pressed" that is full of sheaves." The idea is that of crushing by a heavy weight; and hence, of crushing by affliction. The "wicked" alluded to here, if the supposition referred to in the Introduction about the occasion of the psalm is correct, were Absalom and those who were associated with him in the rebellion, particularly Ahithophel, who had showed himself false to David, and had united with his enemies in their purpose to drive him from his throne.<p>For they east iniquity upon me - That is, they charge me with sin; they attempt to justify themselves in their treatment of me by accusing me of wrong-doing, or by endeavoring to satisfy themselves that I deserve to be treated in this manner. If this refers to the time of the rebellion of Absalom, the allusion would be to the charges, brought by him against his father, of severity and injustice in his administration, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2-6</a>.<p>And in wrath they hate me - In their indignation, in their excitement, they are full of hatred against me. This was manifested by driving him froth his throne and his home. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/55.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. oppression&#8212;literally, "persecution."<p>they &#8230; iniquity&#8212;literally, "they make evil doings slide upon me."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/55.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The voice of the enemy, </span> i.e. their clamours, and threats, and slanders, and insolent boastings; all which are hateful to thee, as well as injurious to me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They cast iniquity upon me:</span> the sense is, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1502;&#1499;&#1497; is not meant to imply that God is one out of many who upheld his threatened life; but rather that He comes within the category of such, and fills it up in Himself alone, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>; and for the origin of this Beth essentiae, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-35.htm">Judges 11:35</a>.

In the rapid transition to invocation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a> the end of the Psalm announces itself. The truth of God is not described as an instrumental agent of the cutting off, but as an impelling cause. It is the same Beth as in the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>): by or out of free impulse. These free-will sacrifices are not spiritual here in opposition to the ritual sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>), but ritual as an outward representation of the spiritual. The subject of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; is the Name of God; the post-biblical language, following <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>, calls God straightway &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, and passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a> and the one before us come very near to this usage.
