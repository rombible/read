And he could come more boldly, and with greater confidence, to God in his trouble, inasmuch as he did not then first begin to call upon him, but it was what he had long constantly, practised and especially in all his difficulties, dangers, and distresses he had been accustomed to have recourse to him his strong helper, and that not in vain. “They,” says Henry, “that think three meals a day little enough for the body, ought much more to think three solemn prayers a day little enough for the soul, and to count it a pleasure, not a task. As it is fit in the morning we should begin the day with God, and in the evening close it with God; so it is fit that, in the midst of the day, we should retire a while to converse with him. It was Daniel’s practice to pray three times a day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a>. And noon was one of Peter’s hours of prayer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:">Acts 10:9</a>.

The former word, <span class="greekheb">אשׂיחה</span>, <span class="ital">asicha, </span>rendered, <span class="ital">I will pray, </span>means also, <span class="ital">I will meditate, speak with my heart, </span>or <span class="ital">converse. </span>Then we pray aright when we pray with all that is within us; when we think first, and then pray; for the true nature of prayer is lifting up our hearts to God. David, having meditated, will <span class="ital">cry, </span>yea, will <span class="ital">cry aloud: </span>the fervour of his spirit in prayer shall be expressed, and yet more excited by the intenseness and earnestness of his voice. <span class="ital">And he shall hear my voice — </span>The Lord shall hear and answer my prayer, by granting my petitions, and will not blame me, either for coming too often, or being too earnest and importunate. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/55.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>55:16-23 In every trial let us call upon the Lord, and he will save us. He shall hear us, and not blame us for coming too often; the oftener the more welcome. David had thought all were against him; but now he sees there were many with him, more than he supposed; and the glory of this he gives to God, for it is he that raises us up friends, and makes them faithful to us. There are more true Christians, and believers have more real friends, than in their gloomy hours they suppose. His enemies should be reckoned with, and brought down; they could not ease themselves of their fears, as David could, by faith in God. Mortal men, though ever so high and strong, will easily be crushed by an eternal God. Those who are not reclaimed by the rod of affliction, will certainly be brought down to the pit of destruction. The burden of afflictions is very heavy, especially when attended with the temptations of Satan; there is also the burden of sin and corruption. The only relief under it is, to look to Christ, who bore it. Whatever it is that thou desirest God should give thee, leave it to him to give it in his own way and time. Care is a burden, it makes the heart stoop. We must commit our ways and works to the Lord; let him do as seemeth him good, and let us be satisfied. To cast our burden upon God, is to rest upon his providence and promise. And if we do so, he will carry us in the arms of his power, as a nurse carries a child; and will strengthen our spirits by his Spirit, so that they shall sustain the trial. He will never suffer the righteous to be moved; to be so shaken by any troubles, as to quit their duty to God, or their comfort in him. He will not suffer them to be utterly cast down. He, who bore the burden of our sorrows, desires us to leave to him to bear the burden of our cares, that, as he knows what is best for us, he may provide it accordingly. Why do not we trust Christ to govern the world which he redeemed?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/55.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for me, I will call upon God - That is, I have no other refuge in my troubles, yet I can go to him, and pour out all the desires of my heart before him.<p>And the Lord shall save me - This expresses strong confidence. On the supposition that the psalm refers to the rebellion of Absalom, David was driven from his home, and his throne, and from the house of God - a poor exile, forsaken by nearly all. But his faith did not fail. He confided in God, and believed that He was able to effect his deliverance, and that He would do it. Rarely can we be placed in circumstances so trying and discouraging as were those of David; never should we, in any circumstances, fall to believe, as he did, that God can deliver us, and that, if we are his friends, we shall be ultimately safe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/55.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-18.

Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a><p>"As for me, I will call upon God." The Psalmist would not endeavour to meet the plots of his adversaries by counterplots, nor imitate their incessant violence, but in direct opposition to their godless behaviour would continually resort to his God. Thus Jesus did, and it has been the wisdom of all believers to do the same. As this exemplifies the contrast of their character, so it will foretell the contrast of their end - the righteous shall ascend to their God, the wicked shall sink to ruin. "And the Lord shall save me." Jehovah will fulfil my desire, and glorify himself to my deliverance. The Psalmist is quite sure. He knows that he will pray, and is equally clear that he will be heard. The covenant name is the pledge of the covenant promise.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a><p>"Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray." Often, but none too often. Seasons of great need call for frequent seasons of devotion. The three periods chosen are most fitting; to begin, continue, and end the day with God is supreme wisdom. Where time has naturally set up a boundary, there let us set up an altar-stone. The Psalmist means that he will always pray; he will run a line of prayer right along the day and track the sun with his petitions. Day and night he saw his enemies busy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-10.htm">Psalm 55:10</a>), and therefore he would meet their activity by continuous prayer. "And cry aloud." He would give a tongue to his complaint; he would be very earnest in his pleas with heaven. Some cry aloud who never say a word. It is the bell of the heart that rings loudest in heaven. Some read it, "I will muse and murmur;" deep heart-thoughts should be attended with inarticulate but vehement utterances of grief. Blessed be God, moaning is translatable in heaven. A father's heart reads a child's heart. "And he shall hear my voice." He is confident that he will prevail; he makes no question that he would be heard, he speaks as if already he were answered. When our window is opened towards heaven, the windows of heaven are open to us. Have but a pleading heart and God will have a plenteous hand.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a><p>"He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me." The deliverance has come. Joab has routed the rebels. The Lord has justified the cause of his anointed. Faith sees as well as foresees; to her foresight is sight. He is not only safe but serene, "delivered in peace" - peace in his inmost soul. "For there were many with me;" many contending against me. Or it may be that he thankfully acknowledges that the Lord raised him up unexpected allies, fetched him succour when he most needed it, and made the friendless monarch once more the head of a great army. The Lord can soon change our condition, and he often does so when our prayers become fervent. The crisis of life is usually the secret place of wrestling. Jabbok makes Jacob a prevailing prince. He who stripped us of all friends to make us see himself in their absence, can give them back again in greater numbers that we may see him more joyfully in the fact of their presence.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a><p>"God shall hear, and afflict them." They make a noise as well as I, and God will hear them. The voice of slander, malice, and pride, is not alone heard by those whom it grieves, it reaches to heaven, it penetrates the divine ear, it demands vengeance, and shall have it. God hears and delivers his people, he hears and destroys the wicked. Their cruel jests, their base falsehoods, their cowardly insults, their daring blasphemies are heard, and shall be repaid to them by the eternal Judge. "Even he that abideth of old." He sits in eternity, enthroned judge for evermore; all the prayers of saints and profanities of sinners are before his Judgment-seat, and he will see that justice is done. "Selah." The singer pauses, overwhelmed with awe in the presence of the everlasting God. "Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God." His own reverential feeling causes him to remember the daring godlessness of the wicked; he feels that his trials have driven him to his God, and he declares that their uninterrupted prosperity was the cause of their living in such neglect of the Most High. It is a very manifest fact that long-continued ease and pleasure are sure to produce the worst influences upon graceless men: though troubles do not convert them, yet the absence of them makes their corrupt nature more readily develop itself. Stagnant water becomes putrid. Summer heat breeds noxious insects. He who is without trouble is often without God. It is a forcible proof of human depravity that man turns the mercy of God into nutriment for sin: the Lord save us from this. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/55.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whilst he destroys them.

Still grieved chiefly by the defection of his unfaithful friend, he once more describes the treachery and heinousness of his conduct (vers. 20. 21), before winding up with a word of comfort for all the righteous (ver. 22), and of menace against all the ungodly (ver. 23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">shall save me.</span> The call is upon the God known to man by nature as the Almighty Ruler of the universe; the answer is from the covenant God of Israel, the Self-existent One, in whom Israel trusts.

In the city all kinds of party passions have broken loose; even his bosom friend has taken a part in this hostile rising. The retrospective reference to the confusion of tongues at Babel which is contained in the word &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>), also in remembrance of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), involves the choice of the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;, which here, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>, denotes a swallowing up, i.e., annihilation by means of confounding and rendering utterly futile. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; is the object to both imperatives, the second of which is &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490; (like the pointing usual in connection with a final guttural) for the sake of similarity of sound. Instead of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; &#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, the pointing is &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; &#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, which is perfectly regular, because the &#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; with a conjunctive accent logically hurries on to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; as its supplement.<p>(Note: Certain exceptions, however, exist, inasmuch as &#1493; sometimes remains even in connection with a disjunctive accent, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>; and it is pointed &#1493; in connection with a conjunctive in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-23.htm">Genesis 45:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-3.htm">Leviticus 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>.)<p>The subjects to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-11.htm">Psalm 55:11</a> are not violence and strife (Hengstenberg, Hitzig), for it is rather a comical idea to make these personified run round about upon the city walls; but (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm">Psalm 59:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a>) the Absalomites, and in fact the spies who incessantly watch the movements of David and his followers, and who to this end roam about upon the heights of the city. The narrative in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a> shows how passively David looked on at this movement, until he abandoned the palace of his own free will and quitted Jerusalem  The espionage in the circuit of the city is contrasted with the movements going on within the city itself by the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;. We are acquainted with but few details of the affair; but we can easily fill in the details for ourselves in accordance with the ambitious, base, and craftily malicious character of Absalom. The assertion that deceit (&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;) and the extremest madness had taken possession of the city is confirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13</a> by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. It is not open enemies who might have had cause for it that are opposed to him, but faithless friends, and among them that Ahithophel of Giloh, the scum of perfidious ingratitude.

He tells him to his face, to his shame, the relationship in which he had stood to him whom he now betrays. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-14.htm">Psalm 55:14</a> is not to be rendered: and thou art, etc., but: and thou (who dost act thus) wast, etc.; for it is only because the principal clause has a retrospective meaning that the futures &#1504;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; and &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; describe what was a custom in the past. The expression is designedly &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; and not &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;; David does not make him feel his kingly eminence, but places himself in the relation to him of man to man, putting him on the same level with himself and treating him as his equal. The suffix of &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; is in this instance not subjective as in the &#1499;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498; of the law respecting the asham or trespass-offering: according to my estimation, but objectively: equal to the worth at which I am estimated, that is to say, equally valued with myself. What heart-piercing significance this word obtains when found in the mouth of the second David, who, although the Son of God and peerless King, nevertheless entered into the most intimate human relationship as the Son of man to His disciples, and among them to that Iscariot! &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; from &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, Arabic alifa, to be accustomed to anything, assuescere, signifies one attached to or devoted to any one; and &#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;, according to the Hebrew meaning of the verb &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, an intimate acquaintance. The first of the relative clauses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a> describes their confidential private intercourse; the second the unrestrained manifestation of it in public. &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a> (vid., supra on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>). &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, to make friendly intercourse sweet, is equivalent to cherishing it. &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; stands over against &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, just like &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, secret counsel, and &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, loud tumult, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>. Here &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473; is just the same as that which the Korahitic poet calls &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1495;&#1493;&#1490;&#1490; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>.<p>In the face of the faithless friends who has become the head of the Absalomite faction David now breaks out, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>, into fearful imprecations. The Chethb is &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, desolationes (super eos); but this word occurs only in the name of a place ("House of desolations"), and does not well suit such direct reference to persons. On the other hand, the Ker &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, let death ensnare or impose upon them, gives a sense that is not to be objected to; it is a pregnant expression, equivalent to: let death come upon them unexpectedly. To this &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488; corresponds the &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the second imprecation: let them go down alive into Hades (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, perhaps originally &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, the &#1492; of which may have been lost beside the &#1495; that follows), i.e., like the company of Korah, while their life is yet vigorous, that is to say, let them die a sudden, violent death. The drawing together of the decipiat (opprimat) mors into one word is the result of the ancient scriptio continua and of the defective mode of writing, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;, like &#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a>, &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>. Bttcher renders it differently: let death crash in upon them; but the future form &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497; is an imaginary one, which cannot be supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>. Hitzig renders it: let death benumb them (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;); but this gives an inconceivable figure, with the turgidity of which the trepidantes Manes in Virgil, Aenid viii. 246, do not admit of comparison. In the confirmation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, together with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; which follows, does not pretend to be any advance in the thought, whether &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512; be rendered a settlement, dwelling, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (lxx, Targum), or an assembly (Aquila, Symmachus, Jerome). Hence Hitzig's rendering: in their shrine, in their breast ( equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>), &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; being short for &#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501; in accordance with the love of contraction which prevails in poetry (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>). But had the poet intended to use this figure he would have written &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1501;, and is not the assertion that wickedness is among them, that it is at home in them, really a climax? The change of the names of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a> is significant. He calls upon Him who is exalted above the world, and He who mercifully interposes in the history of the world helps him. </body></html>
