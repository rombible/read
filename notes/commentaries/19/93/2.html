In this great work, the Father has given all power to his Son, the Lord from heaven, who has made atonement for our sins. He not only can pardon, but deliver and protect all who trust in him. His word is past, and all the saints may rely upon it. Whatever was foretold concerning the kingdom of the Messiah, must be fulfilled in due time. All his people ought to be very strictly pure. God's church is his house; it is a holy house, cleansed from sin, and employed in his service. Where there is purity, there shall be peace.

This animal is called in Talmudic &#1511;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; (perhaps abbreviated from &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;); the Talmud also makes use of &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1500;&#1488; (the gazelle) as synonymous with &#1512;&#1488;&#1501; (Aramaic definitive or emphatic state &#1512;&#1497;&#1502;&#1488;).<p>(Note: Vid., Lewysohn, Zoologie des Talmud, 146 and 174.)<p>The primary passages for figures taken from animal life are <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>. The horn is an emblem of defensive power and at the same time of stately grace; and the fresh, green oil an emblem of the pleasant feeling and enthusiasm, joyous in the prospect of victory, by which the church is then pervaded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>). The lxx erroneously takes &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; as infin. Piel, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, my being grown old, a signification which the Piel cannot have. It is 1st praet. Kal from &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, perfusus sum (cf. Arabic balla, to be moist, ballah and bullah, moistness, good health, the freshness of youth), and the ultima-accentuation, which also occurs in this form of double Ajin verbs without Waw convers. (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm">Job 19:17</a>), ought not to mislead. In the expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1512;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503;, the adjective used in other instances only of the olive-tree itself is transferred to the oil, which contains the strength of its succulent verdure as an essence. The ecclesia pressa is then triumphans. The eye, which was wont to look timidly and tearfully upon the persecutors, the ears, upon which even their name and the tidings of their approach were wont to produce terror, now see their desire upon them as they are blotted out. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468; (found only here) follows the sense of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;, cf. Arab. nd&#803;r f&#305;&#770;, to lose one's self in the contemplation of anything. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; is either a substantive after the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, or a participle in the signification "those who regarded me with hostility, those who lay in wait for me," like &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, fled, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-32.htm">Numbers 35:32</a>, &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, having removed themselves to a distance, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, turned back, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>; for this participial form has not only a passive signification (like &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, circumcised), but sometimes too, a deponent perfect signification; and &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a>, if it belongs here, may signify hurried  equals  in haste. In &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, however, no such passive colouring of the meaning is conceivable; it is therefore: insidiati (Luzatto, Grammatica, 518: coloro che mi guatavano). There is no need for regarding the word, with Bttcher and Olshausen, as distorted from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; (the apocopated participle Pilel of the same verb); one might more readily regard it as a softening of that word as to the sound (Ewald, Hitzig). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a> it is not to be rendered: upon the wicked doers (villains) who rise up against me. The placing of the adjective thus before its substantive must (with the exception of &#1512;&#1489; when used after the manner of a numeral) be accounted impossible in Hebrew, even in the face of the passages brought forward by Hitzig, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>; <p>(Note: In the former passage &#1499;&#1492;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is taken as one notion (chief priest), and in the latter &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; (men with the bow) is, with Keil, to be regarded as an apposition.)<p>it is therefore: upon those who as villains rise up against. The circumstance that the poet now in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-13.htm">Psalm 92:13</a> passes from himself to speak of the righteous, is brought about by the fact that it is the congregation of the righteous in general, i.e., of those who regulate their life according to the divine order of salvation, into whose future he here takes a glance. When the prosperity lit. the blossoming of the ungodly comes to an end, the springing up and growth of the righteous only then rightly has its beginning. The richness of the inflorescence of date-palm (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;) is clear from the fact, that when it has attained its full size, it bears from three to four, and in some instances even as many as six, hundred pounds of fruit. And there is no more charming and majestic sight than the palm of the oasis, this prince among the trees of the plain, with its proudly raised diadem of leaves, its attitude peering forth into the distance and gazing full into the face of the sun, its perennial verdure, and its vital force, which constantly renews itself from the root - a picture of life in the midst of the world of death. The likening of the righteous to the palm, to the "blessed tree," to this "sister of man," as the Arabs call it, offers points of comparison in abundance. Side by side with the palm is the cedar, the prince of the trees of the mountain, and in particular of Mount Lebanon. The most natural point of comparison, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-11.htm">Job 8:11</a>) states, is its graceful lofty growth, then in general &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (Theodoret), i.e., the intensity of its vegetative strength, but also the perpetual verdure of its foliage and the perfume (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-7.htm">Hosea 14:7</a>) which it exhales. </body></html>
