The permanence of the covenant, and of the outward signs that attest it, is to the Israelite proof of the superiority of the Divine power over the forces of nature. We may extend the thought, and say that the moral law is a truer evidence of the existence of God than the uniformity of natural laws.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/93.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-5.htm" title="Your testimonies are very sure: holiness becomes your house, O LORD, for ever.">Psalm 93:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thy testimonies — </span>Thy words: either, 1st, <span class="ital">Thy precepts, </span>which are commonly called God’s <span class="ital">testimonies. </span>And so, having spoken of God’s kingdom, he now showeth that the laws of that kingdom are just, and true, and holy, which is a singular commendation of it.

In this great work, the Father has given all power to his Son, the Lord from heaven, who has made atonement for our sins. He not only can pardon, but deliver and protect all who trust in him. His word is past, and all the saints may rely upon it. Whatever was foretold concerning the kingdom of the Messiah, must be fulfilled in due time. All his people ought to be very strictly pure. God's church is his house; it is a holy house, cleansed from sin, and employed in his service. Where there is purity, there shall be peace. Let all carefully look if this kingdom is set up in their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/93.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy testimonies are very sure - All that thou hast borne witness to; all that thou hast affirmed or declared to be true. This would embrace "all that" God has spoken, whether his law, his promises, his commands, his prophecies, or his statements of what has occurred and of what will occur. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>.<p>Holiness becometh thine house, O Lord - The psalm seems to have been intended to be used in the sanctuary, as a part of public worship, and the word "holiness" here would seem to mean a proper respect for God; confidence in him; a state of mind free from all doubt, and from all that is impure. Perhaps there may be here, also, the idea that in all the convulsions of the world; in all that threatens to overthrow truth and righteousness; in all the attacks which are made on the divine government; in all the efforts of the defenders of error, and in the midst of abounding iniquity, the church should maintain a firm adherence to the principles of "holiness," to that which is right and true. There should be one place - the church - where there would be no wavering in regard to truth and holiness; one place, where the truth would be defended whatever commotions might be abroad. The main idea, therefore, in the psalm is, that, in view of the fact that God reigns, and that nothing can frustrate his plans, or disturb his throne, we should approach him with reverence, with humble trust, with sincere and pure hearts.<p>In a larger sense, also, in the largest sense conceivable - it is true that "holiness," purity, freedom from evil thoughts, from a wanton eye and a wanton imagination, from unholy plans and purposes, should prevail in the house of God, and should be regarded as indispensable to proper worship. As heaven is pure, and as there shall enter there nothing "that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie" <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>, so in the place where we seek to prepare for that holy world - the sanctuary of God - nothing should be allowed to enter that is impure and polluting; nothing that tends to corrupt or defile the soul. It may be added, that attendance in a place of public worship is calculated to make the heart pure, and to banish unholy thoughts and purposes from the soul. A man who feels that he is in the presence of a holy God, will not be likely to welcome into his soul polluted images and unholy desires.<p>Forever - Margin, as in Hebrew, "to length of days." The idea is, that it is always appropriate. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/93.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. While His power inspires dread, His revealed will should secure our confidence (compare Ps 19:7; 25:10), and thus fear and love combined, producing all holy emotions, should distinguish the worship we offer in His house, both earthly and heavenly.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/93.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy testimonies, </span> i.e. thy words; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Of God himself who dwelt in his house, from whence he gave forth his oracles, and where all his testimonies were kept upon record. This seems better to suit with the context, the business of this Psalm being rather to describe the dominion of God than the duty of his people. And so the sense seems to be this, Holiness is the constant ornament and glory of thy house. Or it becometh thee who dwellest in thy house to be holy in all thy words and actions; and therefore thy testimonies are very sure, and thou wilt undoubtedly fulfil all thy promises. For holiness seems to be here taken for God’s faithfulness, as it is <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm" title="God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.">Psalm 60:6</a> 89:35</span>; or, which comes to the same thing, for his justice or righteousness, whereby he is obliged to make good all his promises, as that word is very commonly used. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/93.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thy testimonies are very sure,....

But this sense of the word is unsupported, and it is best to take it in its usual sense of the ‘law,’ regarded as bearing witness to Jehovah’s will and man’s duty. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm" title="The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.">Psalm 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-7.htm" title="The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.">Psalm 111:7</a>. The transition seems somewhat abrupt; yet it is not inappropriate that the Psalm should close with a reference to the revelation which was the distinctive mark of Jehovah’s kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-7.htm" title="For what nation is there so great, who has God so near to them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call on him for?...">Deuteronomy 4:7-8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">holiness</span> &c.] God’s house may be either the Temple or the land. The Psalmist is confident that now the ideal will be realised. Jehovah has returned to dwell there, and it shall no more be defiled by Israel itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-30.htm" title="For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.">Jeremiah 7:30</a>), no more be desecrated by heathen invaders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-17.htm" title="So shall you know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.">Joel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for ever</span>] R.V. for evermore; lit. <span class="ital">for length of days</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-16.htm" title="With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.">Psalm 91:16</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/93.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy testimonies are very sure.</span> God's "testimonies" are his commandments, considered as witnesses to man of his nature and his will respecting them.
