An illustration has been aptly produced in Livy’s description of the feelings of the Greeks when they heard at the Isthmian games (B.C. 196), after the defeat of the Macedonians by T. Flaminius, the proclamation of the herald that they should, by the free gift of the Roman people, retain their liberty. “The joy was too great for men to take it all in.

The Hebrew word which is rendered in the text captivity means properly return; and then, those returning. The ancient versions render it captivity. The reference clearly is to those who were returning to Zion, and the psalmist fixes his eye on them as returning, and immediately says that it was the Lord who had thus restored them. The whole was to be traced to God.<p>We were like them that dream - The Latin Vulgate and the Septuagint render this, "we were comforted." The meaning is, "It seemed like a dream; we could hardly realize that it was so; it was so marvelous, so good, so full of joy, that we could scarcely believe it was real." This state of mind is not uncommon, when, in sudden and overpowering joy, we ask whether it can be real; whether it is not all a dream. We fear that it is; we apprehend that it will all vanish away like a dream. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/126.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 126<p>Ps 126:1-6.

Then sorrow was gone like a dream, and the joy which followed was so great that it seemed too good to be true, and they feared that it must be the vision of an idle brain. So sudden and so overwhelming was their joy that they felt like men out of themselves, ecstatic, or in a trance. The captivity had been great, and great was the deliverance; for the great God himself had wrought it: it seemed too good to be actually true: each man said to himself, - <p>"Is this a dream? O if it be a dream,<p>Let me sleep on, and do not wake me yet."<p>It was not the freedom of an individual which the Lord in mercy had wrought, but of all Zion, of the whole nation; and this was reason enough for overflowing gladness. We need not instance the histories which illustrate this verse in connection with literal Israel; but it is well to remember how often it has been true to ourselves. Let us look to the prison-houses from which we have been set free. Ah, me, what captives we have been! At our first conversion what a turning again of captivity we experienced. Never shall that hour be forgotten. Joy! Joy! Joy! Since then, from multiplied troubles, from depression of spirit, from miserable backsliding, from grievous doubt, we have been emancipated, and we are not able to describe the bliss which followed each emancipation.<p>"When God reveal'd his gracious name<p>And changed our mournful state,<p>Our rapture seem'd a pleasing dream.<p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm was composed by Ezra, or some other man of God, at the return of Israel from Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The church, celebrating and praising God for her return out of the Babylonian captivity, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/126-1.htm" title="When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream....">Psalm 126:1-3</a></span>, prayeth him to perfect his work, and foretelleth the good success thereof, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/126-4.htm" title="Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south....">Psalm 126:4-6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">Turned again the captivity of Zion, </span> i.e. brought the captive Israelites out of Babylon into their own land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We were like them that dream; </span> we were so surprised and astonished with the report of such a favour, that we could not believe our own eyes and ears, but thought it to be but a dream or delusion of our own fancies; as is usual in matters of great joy, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-26.htm" title="And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.

Or returned the Jews from their captivity in Babylon; who are called Zion, from the city of David, built on Mount Zion, which was in Judea, and adjoined to Jerusalem, the metropolis of the kingdom; and because they were the godly who were concerned for Zion in a spiritual sense, or the church of God, and the interest of religion, whose spirits the Lord stirred up to come out of Babylon, upon the proclamation by Cyrus, when those that were more worldly and carnal stayed behind; as also because the chief mercy in returning the captives was the rebuilding the temple on Mount Zion, and the restoration of religious worship; which gave the religious captives in Babylon great concern, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>. This deliverance of the captives, though it was by Cyrus as an instrument, yet it was the Lord's work; which he employed him in, and stirred him up to do, and therefore is ascribed to him. And though this is expressed in the past tense, yet it may be put for the future; and be considered as a prophecy of it, and which the following word seems to confirm; and especially the prayer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-4.htm">Psalm 126:4</a>; for the return of the captivity seems to require it should: and may not only literally respect the return of the captives in Babylon, but the conversion of the Jews in the latter day, and their deliverance from their present captivity; which is expressed sometimes by the Lord's bringing again Zion, and returning the captivity of the Jews, and their being turned to the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>; and may be applied to spiritual and eternal redemption by Christ, of which the deliverance from Babylon was a type; and is sometimes expressed in the same language, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a>; and the people redeemed are often signified by Zion, and are by nature captives to sin, Satan, and the law; from whence they are redeemed by Christ, whose work alone it is, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>; <p>we were like them that dream; or "shall be" (p); that is, as persons that know not whether they are asleep or awake; and whether what they see and enjoy is in reality or only a vision, as Peter's deliverance from prison was to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-9.htm">Acts 12:9</a>; When the proclamation by Cyrus was first heard of by the Jews, and they had their liberty upon it, they could hardly tell whether it was a real thing or a vision, and could scarcely believe it for joy; it seemed too good news to be true, as the news of Joseph's being alive was to Jacob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-26.htm">Genesis 45:26</a>; and so the appearance of Christ, his resurrection, and redemption by him, were to the disciples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a>. The Targum is, <p>"we were like the sick that are recovered;'' <p>which sense the word has in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-4.htm">Job 39:4</a>; and will be the case of the Jews, when they are converted; who will be recovered out of the sick state and condition in which they now are, and have all their diseases healed, and sins forgiven; yea, their conversion will be as life from the dead, a resurrection of them from their graves, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm">Romans 11:15</a>. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, render it, "as those that are comforted"; and the Syriac version, "as those that rejoice"; each of the seasons mentioned being times of comfort and joy: Joseph Kimchi interprets it of the passing away and forgetfulness of affliction and trouble at the time of redemption, like a dream that flies away upon awaking. <p>(p) "erimus", Musculus, Gejerus, Schmidt; so the Targum, Syr.
