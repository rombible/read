And how ought redemption from the wrath to come, from the power of sin and of Satan, to be valued! The sinner convinced of his guilt and danger, when by looking to a crucified Saviour he receives peace to his conscience, and power to break off his sins, often can scarcely believe that the prospect which opens to him is a reality.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/126.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord hath done great things for us - All that the people around us say is true. We see it; we feel it; we acknowledge it. Those to whom this pertained would see it more clearly than those who had merely observed it. A surrounding world may see in the conversion of a man, in his being turned from sin, in the influence of religion upon him, in his comfort, calmness, and peace, that "the Lord has done great things" for him; but he himself, while he responds most fully to what they say, will see this more clearly than they do. There is more in his redemption, his conversion, his peace and joy, than they do or can perceive, and with emphasis he himself will say, "The Lord has done great things for me."<p>Whereof we are glad - It fills our souls with joy. If this is understood of the returning Hebrews - coming back from the captivity in Babylon - all must see how appropriate is the language; if it be applied to a sinner returning to God, it is no less suitable, for there is nothing that so fills the mind with joy as a true conversion to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/126.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 126<p>Ps 126:1-6.

These words are generally supposed to be the words of the Jews, taking up those of the Gentiles, and confirming them; acknowledging that the Lord had done great things for them indeed; which, had they not owned, they would have been exceeding ungrateful; had they been silent concerning them, the stones would have cried out, and the very Heathens condemned them. But I see not why they may not be thought to be the words of those among the Heathens continued; declaring that the great things done were not for the Jews only, but for them also; as the great redemption by Christ is of persons out of every tongue, people, and nation; for he is the propitiation, not for the Jews only, but for the sins of the whole world; and having this in view, thus they express themselves. The work of redemption is a great thing of itself; the produce of great wisdom; the effect of great love; procured at a great price, for great sinners, by a great Saviour; and is not only a deliverance from sin, Satan, and the law; but contains many great and glorious blessings in it, as justification, remission of sins, adoption, and eternal life; <p>whereof we are glad; that those great things are done without us, finished by the Redeemer himself; that they are so great and glorious, so rich and plenteous, so full and free, and suitable to us; and done for us sinners of the Gentiles, so unworthy of them, who are by nature children of wrath as others. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/126.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/126.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

The future &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; signifies: He sits and will sit, that is to say, He continues to sit, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-5.htm">Psalm 122:5</a>. Older expositors are of opinion that the heavenly Zion must be understood on account of the Chaldaean and the Roman catastrophes; but these, in fact, only came upon the buildings on the mountain, not upon the mountain itself, which in itself and according to its appointed destiny (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>) remained unshaken. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a> also it is none other than the earthly Jerusalem that is meant. The holy city has a natural circumvallation of mountains, and the holy nation that dwells and worships therein has a still infinitely higher defence in Jahve, who encompasses it round (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>), as perhaps a wall of fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>), or an impassably broad and mighty river (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>); a statement which is also now confirmed, for, etc. Instead of inferring from the clause <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a> that which is to be expected with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, the poet confirms it with &#1499;&#1497; by that which is surely to be expected. </body></html>
