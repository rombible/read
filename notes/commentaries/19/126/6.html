The words of the prophet Haggai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/haggai/1-10.htm" title="Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.">Haggai 1:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-19.htm" title="Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.">Haggai 2:19</a>), contemporary with the Return, should be compared. The word rendered “precious” in the Authorised Version may be correctly represented by “handful.” Its meaning is “drawing;” and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.">Amos 9:13</a> (see margin) we see that the sower was called “the drawer of seed,” no doubt from the hand being repeatedly drawn out for the cast from the bag or basket containing the seed. Others render “seed-basket” here. The contrast so beautifully painted in this verse was certainly realised when “the priests and Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of the house of God with joy” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm" title="And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.">Ezra 6:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-22.htm" title="And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.">Ezra 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-42.htm" title="And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.">Nehemiah 12:42</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/126.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>126:4-6 The beginnings of mercies encourage us to pray for the completion of them. And while we are in this world there will be matter for prayer, even when we are most furnished with matter for praise. Suffering saints are often in tears; they share the calamities of human life, and commonly have a greater share than others. But they sow in tears; they do the duty of an afflicted state. Weeping must not hinder sowing; we must get good from times of affliction. And they that sow, in the tears of godly sorrow, to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting; and that will be a joyful harvest indeed. Blessed are those that mourn, for they shall be for ever comforted. When we mourn for our sins, or suffer for Christ's sake, we are sowing in tears, to reap in joy. And remember that God is not mocked; for whatever a man soweth that shall he reap, Ga 6:7-9. Here, O disciple of Jesus, behold an emblem of thy present labour and future reward; the day is coming when thou shalt reap in joy, plentiful shall be thy harvest, and great shall be thy joy in the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/126.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that goeth forth and weepeth - He that goes forth weeping - still an allusion to the farmer. He is seen moving slowly and sadly over the plowed ground, burdened with his task, an in tears.<p>Bearing precious seed - Margin, "seed-basket." Literally, "bearing the drawing out of seed;" perhaps the seed as drawn out of his bag; or, as scattered or sown regularly in furrows, so that it seems to be drawn out in regular lines over the fields.<p>Shall doubtless come again - Shall come to this sown field again in the time of harvest. He will visit it with other feelings than those which he now has.<p>With rejoicing ... - Then his tears will be turned to joy. Then the rich harvest will wave before him. Then he will thrust in his sickle and reap. Then he will gather the golden grain, and the wain will groan under the burden, and the sheaves will be carried forth with songs of joy. He will be abundantly rewarded for all his toil; he will see the fruit of his labors; he will be filled with joy. The design of this illustration was, undoubtedly, to cheer the hearts of the exiles in their long and dangerous journey to their native land; it has, however, a wider and more universal application, as being suited to encourage all in their endeavors to secure their own salvation, and to do good in the world - for the effort is often attended with sacrifice, toil, and tears. The joy of heaven will be more than a compensation for all this. The following remarks by Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book, vol. i., pp. 118, 119) will furnish an illustration of the meaning of this passage: "I never saw people sowing in tears exactly, but have often known them to do it in fear and distress sufficient to draw them from any eye. In seasons of great scarcity, the poor peasants part in sorrow with every measure of precious seed cast into the ground. It is like taking bread out of the mouths of their children; and in such times many bitter tears are actually shed over it. The distress is frequently so great that government is obliged to furnish seed, or none would be sown. Ibrahim Pasha did this more than once within my remembrance, copying the example, perhaps, of his great predecessor in Egypt when the seven years' famine was ended. The thoughts of this psalm may likewise have been suggested by the extreme danger which frequently attends the farmer in his plowing and sowing.<p>The calamity which fell upon the farmers of Job when the oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14-15</a>, is often repeated in our day. To understand this, you must remember what I just told you about the situation of the arable lands in the open country; and here again we meet that verbal accuracy: the sower goes forth - that is, from the village. The people of Ibel and Khiem, in Merj &#8219;Aiyun, for example, have their best grain-growing fields down in the &#8219;Ard Huleh, six or eight miles from their homes, and just that much nearer the lawless border of the desert. When the country is disturbed, or the government weak, they cannot sow these lands except at the risk of their lives. Indeed, they always go forth in large companies, and completely armed, ready to drop the plow and seize the musket at a moment's warning; and yet, with all this care, many sad and fatal calamities overtake the people who must thus sow in tears.<p>And still another origin may be found for the thoughts of the psalm in the extreme difficulty of the work itself in many places. The soil is rocky, impracticable, overgrown with sharp thorns; and it costs much painful toil to break up and gather out the rocks, cut and burn the briers, and to subdue the stubborn soil, especially with their feeble oxen and insignificant plows. Join all these together, and the sentiment is very forcibly brought out, that he who labors hard, in cold and in rain, in fear and danger, in poverty and in want, casting his precious seed in the ground, will surely come again, at harvest-time, with rejoicing, and bearing his sheaves with him." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/126.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. He that goeth forth&#8212;literally, better, "He goes&#8212;he comes, he comes," &c. The repetition implies there is no end of weeping here, as there shall be no end of joy hereafter (Isa 35:10).<p>precious seed&#8212;rather, seed to be drawn from the seed box for sowing; literally, "seed-draught."

Which he sows in tears. This is but a repetition and confirmation of what is before expressed in different words; and may be applied, as to a praying saint, so to a faithful preacher of the word. The word is the precious seed which he bears, which he takes out of the granaries of the Scriptures; and carries from place to place, and scatters and sows, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-11.htm">Luke 8:11</a>; compared to seed, because of its meanness in the eyes of those that know it not; because of its generative virtue and increase, which it has from God, and which, unless sown in the earth, produces no fruit: and it is called "precious seed", because either bought at a great price, when grain is dear; or because it usually is the choicest wheat that is the sowing seed; and so may denote the preciousness and value of the Gospel, dispensed by Christ's faithful ministers, which is called a sowing of spiritual things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>; which should be done plentifully and constantly, and with the same sort of seed or doctrine, and which requires art and skill; and is often performed weeping or with tears, because of their own insufficiency, through fear of success, and through want of it; and because of the badness of the ground, the hardness of men's hearts they have to do with. The allusion seems to be to a poor husbandman, that has got but little seed to sow, and this bought at a dear price; and which he buries under the clods, and fears it will rise no more; and weeps as he sows, because of the badness of the weather, or of the soil, doubting of success. Aben Ezra, by the words rendered "precious seed", or, as they may be, "a draught of seed" (r), understands the vessel in which the sower carries his seed, the seed basket, from whence he draws and takes out the seed, and scatters it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a>; so the Targum, <p>"bearing a tray of sowing corn;'' <p>shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him; the seed he has been to and fro in sowing springs up under a divine blessing; and, beyond his expectation and fears, produces a large and plentiful crop; which he reaps, and returns home, not with his arms full of sheaves only, but with his cart laden with them: so a faithful minister, sooner or later, is blessed with converts, who will be his joy and crown of rejoicing another day: see <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>. <p>(r)  "tractionem seminis", Montanus, Piscator, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/126.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves <i>with him</i>.</span><p>(e) That is, seed which was scarce and dear: meaning, that they who trusted in God's promise to return had their desire.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/126.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

The poet supplicates good for them, viz., preservation against denying God and deliverance out of slavery; for those, on the contrary, who bend (&#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;) their crooked paths, i.e., turn aside their paths in a crooked direction from the right way (&#1506;&#1511;&#1500;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>, no less than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>, an accusative of the object, which is more natural than that it is the accusative of the direction, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a> extrem., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm">Job 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11</a>) - for these he wishes that Jahve would clear them away (&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; like Arab. ahlk, perire facere  equals  perdere) together with the workers of evil, i.e., the open, manifest sinners, to whom these lukewarm and sly, false and equivocal ones are in no way inferior as a source of danger to the church. lxx correctly: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; (Aquila &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;, Symmachus &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, Theodotion &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;) &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;. &#x3c4;. &#x3bb;.. Finally, the poet, stretching out his hand over Israel as if pronouncing the benediction of the priest, gathers up all his hopes, prayers, and wishes into the one prayer: "Peace be upon Israel." He means "the Israel of God," <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>. Upon this Israel he calls down peace from above. Peace is the end of tyranny, hostility, dismemberment, unrest, and terror; peace is freedom and harmony and unity and security and blessedness. </body></html>
