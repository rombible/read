Magistrates are the ministers of God's providence, for keeping up order and peace, and particularly in punishing evil-doers, and protecting those that do well. Good princes and good judges, who mean well, are under Divine direction; and bad ones, who mean ill, are under Divine restraint. The authority of God is to be submitted to, in those governors whom his providence places over us. But when justice is turned from what is right, no good can be expected. The evil actions of public persons are public mischiefs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/82.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Defend the poor and fatherless - literally, judge; that is, Pronounce just judgment; see that right is done to them. This is required everywhere in the Scriptures. The meaning is not that judgment is to be pronounced in their favor because they are poor, or because they are orphans, for this would be to do what they had just been charged with as in itself wrong, accepting of persons; that is, showing favor on account of condition or rank, rather than on account of a just claim. The idea is, that the poor and the fatherless, having no natural protectors, were likely to be wronged or oppressed; that they had none to defend their claims; and that magistrates, therefore, as if they were their natural protectors, should see that their rights were maintained. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>.<p>Do justice to the afflicted and needy - See that justice is done them; that they are not wronged by persons of wealth, of power, and of rank. Such care does religion take of those who have no natural guardians. The poor and the needy - the widow and the fatherless - owe to the religion of the Bible a debt which no language can express. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/82.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

"My people" and "Israel" alternate as in the complaint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492; followed by the dative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-9.htm">Deuteronomy 13:9</a> ([8], &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;). Then God made their sin their punishment, by giving them over judicially (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-4.htm">Job 8:4</a>) into the obduracy of their heart, which rudely shuts itself up against His mercy (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;, Aramaic &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;, Arabic sarra, to make firm  equals  to cheer, make glad), so that they went on (cf. on the sequence of tense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>) in their, i.e., their own, egotistical, God-estranged determinations; the suffix is thus accented, as e.g., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>, cf. the borrowed passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>, and the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>. And now, because this state of unfaithfulness in comparison with God's faithfulness has remained essentially the same even to to-day, the exalted Orator of the festival passes over forthwith to the generation of the present, and that, as is in accordance with the cheerful character of the feast, in a charmingly alluring manner. Whether we take &#1500;&#1493;&#1468; in the signification of si (followed by the participle, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-12.htm">2 Samuel 18:12</a>), or like &#1488;&#1501; above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a> as expressing a wish, o si (if but!), <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-15.htm">Psalm 81:15</a>. at any rate have the relation of the apodosis to it. From &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496; (for a little, easily) it may be conjectured that the relation of Israel at that time to the nations did not correspond to the dignity of the nation of God which is called to subdue and rule the world in the strength of God. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; signifies in this passage only to turn, not: to again lay upon. The meaning is, that He would turn the hand which is now chastening His people against those by whom He is chastening them (cf. on the usual meaning of the phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-12.htm">Ezekiel 38:12</a>). The promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a> relates to Israel and all the members of the nation. The haters of Jahve would be compelled reluctantly to submit themselves to Him, and their time would endure for ever. "Time" is equivalent to duration, and in this instance with the collateral notion of Prosperity, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>) of the term of punishment. One now expects that it should continue with &#1493;&#1488;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, in the tone of a promise. The Psalm, however, closes with an historical statement. For &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493; cannot signify et cibaret eum; it ought to be pronounced &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;. The pointing, like the lxx, Syriac, and Vulgate, takes v. 17a (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>.) as a retrospect, and apparently rightly so. For even the Asaphic <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77.htm">Psalm 77</a> and 78 break off with historical pictures. V. 17b is, accordingly, also to be taken as retrospective. The words of the poet in conclusion once more change into the words of God. The closing word runs &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-31.htm">Deuteronomy 4:31</a>, and (with the exception of the futt. Hiph. of Lamed He verbs ending with ekka) usually. The Babylonian system of pointing nowhere recognises the suffix-form ekka. If the Israel of the present would hearken to the Lawgiver of Sinai, says v. 17, then would He renew to it the miraculous gifts of the time of the redemption under Moses. </body></html>
