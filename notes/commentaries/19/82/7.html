But all the rulers of the earth shall die, and all their honour shall be laid in the dust. God governs the world. There is a righteous God to whom we may go, and on whom we may depend. This also has respect to the kingdom of the Messiah. Considering the state of affairs in the world, we have need to pray that the Lord Jesus would speedily rule over all nations, in truth, righteousness, and peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/82.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye shall die like men - You are mortal, like other people. This fact you have forgotten. You have been lifted up with pride, as if you were in fact more exalted than other people; as if you were not subject to the law which consigns all people to the grave. An ancient monarch directed his servant to address him each morning in this language: "Remember, sire, that thou art mortal." No more salutary truth can be impressed on the minds of the rich and the great than that they are, in this respect, like other people - like the poorest, the meanest of the race: that they will die under similar forms of disease; that they will experience the same pain; that all which is fearful in death will be their portion as well as that of the most obscure; and that in the grave, with whatever pomp and splendor they descend to it, or however magnificent the monument which may be reared over the spot where they lie, there will be the same offensive and repulsive process of decay which occurs in the most humble grave in the country churchyard. Why, then - oh, why - should man be proud?<p>And fall like one of the princes - And die as one of the princes. The idea in the word fall may be, perhaps, that they would die by the hand of violence - or be cut down, as princes often are, e. g. in battle. The use of the word princes here denotes that they would die as other persons of exalted rank do; that is, that they were mortal as all people, high and low, are - as common people are, and as princes are. Though they had names - &#1488;&#1500;  'E&#770;l, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'Elohiym - that suggested the idea of divinity, yet such appellations did not make any real change in their condition as people, and as subject to the ordinary laws under which people live. Whatever name they bore. it did not afford any security against death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/82.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. fall like, &c.&#8212;be cut off suddenly (Ps 20:8; 91:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/82.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But ye shall die:</span> but let not this make you insolent and secure; for though you are gods by name and office, yet still you are mortal men, you must die and give up your account to me your superior Lord and Governor; and you shall die and fall by the hands of my justice, if you persist in your unjust and ungodly courses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like men; </span> or, <span class="ital">like ordinary men</span>, as the Hebrew word <span class="ital">adam</span> sometimes signifies, as it doth <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-2.htm" title="Both low and high, rich and poor, together.">Psalm 49:2</a></span>.

The "congregation of God" is, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-16.htm">Joshua 22:16</a>., "the congregation of (the sons of) Israel," which God has purchased from among the nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm">Psalm 74:2</a>), and upon which as its Lawgiver He has set His divine impress. The psalmist and seer sees Elohim standing in this congregation of God. The part. Niph. (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a>) denotes not so much the suddenness and unpreparedness, as, rather, the statue-like immobility and terrifying designfulness of His appearance. Within the range of the congregation of God this holds good of the elohim. The right over life and death, with which the administration of justice cannot dispense, is a prerogative of God. From the time of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, however, He has transferred the execution of this prerogative to mankind, and instituted in mankind an office wielding the sword of justice, which also exists in His theocratic congregation, but here has His positive law as the basis of its continuance and as the rule of its action. Everywhere among men, but here pre-eminently, those in authority are God's delegates and the bearers of His image, and therefore as His representatives are also themselves called elohim, "gods" (which the lxx in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a> renders &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, and the Targums here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7-8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a> uniformly, &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;). The God who has conferred this exercise of power upon these subordinate elohim, without their resigning it of themselves, now sits in judgment in their midst. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; of that which takes place before the mind's eye of the psalmist. How long, He asks, will ye judge unjustly? &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; is equivalent to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a> (the opposite is &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>). How long will ye accept the countenance of the wicked, i.e., incline to accept, regard, favour the person of the wicked? The music, which here becomes forte, gives intensity to the terrible sternness (das Niederdonnernde) of the divine question, which seeks to bring the "gods" of the earth to their right mind. Then follow admonitions to do that which they have hitherto left undone. They are to cause the benefit of the administration of justice to tend to the advantage of the defenceless, of the destitute, and of the helpless, upon whom God the Lawgiver especially keeps His eye. The word &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), of which there is no evidence until within the time of David and Solomon, is synonymous with &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;. &#1491;&#1500; with &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1501; is pointed &#1491;&#1500;, and with &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, on account of the closer notional union, &#1491;&#1500; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-13.htm">Psalm 72:13</a>). They are words which are frequently repeated in the prophets, foremost in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>), with which is enjoined upon those invested with the dignity of the law, and with jurisdiction, justice towards those who cannot and will not themselves obtain their rights by violence. </body></html>
