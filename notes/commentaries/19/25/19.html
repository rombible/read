It is good thus to hope, and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. And if God turns to us, no matter who turns from us. He pleads his own integrity. Though guilty before God, yet, as to his enemies, he had the testimony of conscience that he had done them no wrong. God would, at length, give Israel rest from all their enemies round about. In heaven, God's Israel will be perfectly redeemed from all troubles. Blessed Saviour, thou hast graciously taught us that without thee we can do nothing. Do thou teach us how to pray, how to appear before thee in the way which thou shalt choose, and how to lift up our whole hearts and desires after thee, for thou art the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Consider mine enemies - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>. It is evident that one source of the trouble referred to in the psalm was the fact that he had cruel foes, and that he was apprehensive of their designs. The train of thought seems to be, in accordance with the remarks above, that enemies actually surrounded him, and threatened him, and that this fact suggested the inquiry whether this was not permitted on account of his sins. this had led him to think of the sins of his past life, going back as far as his youth <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7</a>, as if these calamities, even in advanced life, were on account of those early offences.<p>For they are many - Who and what they were, we have now no means of ascertaining. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>.<p>And they hate me with cruel hatred - Margin, as in Hebrew: "hatred of violence." It was such hatred as tended to violence; such that they could not restrain it. It sought his destruction, and was ready to break out at any moment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-19.
