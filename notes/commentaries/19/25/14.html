We value a promise by the character of him that makes it; we therefore depend upon God's promises. All the paths of the Lord, that is, all his promises and all his providences, are mercy and truth. In all God's dealings his people may see his mercy displayed, and his word fulfilled, whatever afflictions they are now exercised with. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth; and so it will appear when they come to their journey's end. Those that are humble, that distrust themselves, and desire to be taught and to follow Divine guidance, these he will guide in judgment, that is, by the rule of the written word, to find rest for their souls in the Saviour. Even when the body is sick, and in pain, the soul may be at ease in God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The secret of the Lord - On the word here rendered "secret," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>. It properly means a couch or cushion; and then, a divan or circle of friends sitting together; then, deliberation or consultation; then, familiar contact, intimacy; and then, a "secret," - as if it were the result of a private consultation among friends, or something which pertained to them, and which they did not wish to have known. It is rendered "secret" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-13.htm">Proverbs 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-19.htm">Proverbs 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-9.htm">Proverbs 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>; "counsel" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-14.htm">Psalm 55:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-2.htm">Psalm 64:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-3.htm">Psalm 83:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-22.htm">Jeremiah 23:22</a>; and "assembly" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a>. The word "friendship" would perhaps express the meaning here. The sense is, that those who fear the Lord are admitted to the intimacy of friendship with Him; are permitted to come into His presence, and to partake of His counsels; are allowed free access to Him; or, as it is more commonly expressed, have "fellowship" with Him. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>. The language is such as would be applied to the intimacy of friends, or to those who take counsel together. The language belongs to a large class of expressions denoting the close connection between God and His people.<p>With them that fear him - With those who truly and properly reverence Him, or who are His true worshippers: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>.<p>And he will show them his covenant - Margin, "And his covenant to make them know it." The meaning is, that God will impart to them the true knowledge of His covenant; or, in other words, He will enable them to understand what there is in that covenant, or in its gracious provisions, that is adapted to promote their happiness and salvation. The word "covenant" here is the same term which is commonly used to describe the arrangements which God has made for the salvation of people: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>. Whatever there is in that arrangement to promote the happiness and salvation of His people, He will cause them to understand. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

The secret of his purposes with them; as his purpose according to election; his resolution to redeem his chosen ones by his Son; his design to call them by his grace; his predestination of them to the adoption of children, and eternal life; which are the deep things of God the Spirit of God reveals; and all which are made manifest to them in effectual calling; and the secret of his providences is with them; some are made known to them that fear the Lord before they come to pass; as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah to Abraham, with many other instances in the Old Testament; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>; and what is the book of the Revelation but a revelation of the secrets of Providence, from the time of Christ and his apostles, to the end of the world? some they observe and take notice of while they are performing, and see the gracious designs of God in them, for their good and his glory; and though some of his ways of Providence are past finding out, and his footsteps are not known as yet; hereafter his judgments will be made manifest, and the whole scene will be opened to the saints, and be clear to their view: the secret of his love, free grace, and favour, is with them, which was in his heart from everlasting, and lay hid in his thoughts, which are as much higher than ours as the heavens are higher than the earth; and which is made manifest in regeneration, and then shed abroad in the hearts of his people: secret communion with God is enjoyed by those that fear him, which is what the world knows nothing of, and the joy that results from it is what a stranger intermeddles not with; the Lord has his chambers and secret places, into which he brings them, and where they dwell. The secret of his Gospel is with them; and the mysteries of it, which were kept secret since the world began; as the mystery of a trinity of Persons in the Godhead; the union of the two natures in Christ; the regeneration of the Spirit; the union of the saints to Christ, and their communion with him; the calling of the Gentiles; the resurrection of the dead; and the change of living saints; <p>and he will show them his covenant: the covenant of grace, which was made with Christ for them from eternity, is made known to them in time, when they are called by the grace of God, and made partakers of the grace of the covenant, then the Lord reveals himself as their covenant God and Father; shows them that his Son is their surety, Mediator, Redeemer, and Saviour; puts his Spirit into them to implant covenant grace in them, to seal up the blessings of it to them, and bear witness to their interest in them, as pardon, justification, and adoption; and to apply the exceeding great and precious promises of it to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> secret of the LORD <i>is</i> with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.</span><p>(m) His counsel contained in his word, by which he declares that he is the protector of the faithful.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.
