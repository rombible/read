It is good thus to hope, and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. And if God turns to us, no matter who turns from us. He pleads his own integrity. Though guilty before God, yet, as to his enemies, he had the testimony of conscience that he had done them no wrong. God would, at length, give Israel rest from all their enemies round about. In heaven, God's Israel will be perfectly redeemed from all troubles. Blessed Saviour, thou hast graciously taught us that without thee we can do nothing. Do thou teach us how to pray, how to appear before thee in the way which thou shalt choose, and how to lift up our whole hearts and desires after thee, for thou art the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O keep my soul - "My life;" or, keep "me." The allusion is to all the perils which encompassed him, whether arising from his foes or his sins; and the prayer is, that the divine protection might be commensurate with the danger; that is, that he might not be destroyed, either by his enemies or by the sins which he had committed.<p>And deliver me - Save me; rescue me.<p>Let me not be ashamed - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>.<p>For I put my trust in thee - This is urged as a reason why he should be delivered and saved. The idea seems to be, that the honor of God would be concerned in protecting one who fled to Him; who confided in Him; who relied on Him. Thus, when the helpless and the oppressed have so much confidence in our character and our ability as to fly to us in the time of trouble, it is a proper reason for them to ask our protection that they do confide in us. Our character becomes involved in the matter, and they may safely trust that we shall feel ourselves under obligations to act in conformity with the confidence reposed in us. It is thus that the poor and the oppressed confide in the good; thus that a sinner confides in God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. keep my soul&#8212;(Ps 16:1).<p>put my trust&#8212;flee for refuge (Ps 2:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My soul, </span> i.e. myself or my life, as that word is commonly taken; for his soul was out of his enemiesâ€™ reach, who could only <span class="ital">kill his body</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-4.htm" title="And I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.">Luke 12:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O keep my soul,....

The reciprocal &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> (which see), leads one to the right primary signification. Starting from the primary meaning of the root &#1505;&#1491;, "to be or to make tight, firm, compressed," &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; signifies a being closely pressed together for the purpose of secret communication and converse, confidential communion or being together, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a> (Symm. &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;), then the confidential communication itself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-15.htm">Psalm 55:15</a>, a secret (Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Theod. &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;). So here: He opens his mind without any reserve, speaks confidentially with those who fear Him; cf. the derivative passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>, and an example of the thing itself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a> the infinitive with &#1500;, according to Ges. &#1431;132, rem. 1, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>, is an expression for the fut. periphrast.: faedus suum notum facturus est iis; the position of the words is like <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-16.htm">Daniel 2:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-15.htm">Daniel 4:15</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506; is used of the imparting of not merely intellectual, but experimental knowledge. Hitzig renders it differently, viz., to enlighten them. But the Hiph. is not intended to be used thus absolutely even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-21.htm">2 Samuel 7:21</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; is the object; it is intended of the rich and deep and glorious character of the covenant revelation. The poet has now on all sides confirmed the truth, that every good gift comes down from above, from the God of salvation; and he returns to the thought from which he started. </body></html>
