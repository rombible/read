It is certain that none who, by a believing attendance, wait on God, and, by a believing hope, wait for him, shall be ashamed of it. The most advanced believer both needs and desires to be taught of God. If we sincerely desire to know our duty, with resolution to do it, we may be sure that God will direct us in it. The psalmist is earnest for the pardon of his sins. When God pardons sin, he is said to remember it no more, which denotes full remission. It is God's goodness, and not ours, his mercy, and not our merit, that must be our plea for the pardon of sin, and all the good we need. This plea we must rely upon, feeling our own unworthiness, and satisfied of the riches of God's mercy and grace. How boundless is that mercy which covers for ever the sins and follies of a youth spent without God and without hope! Blessed be the Lord, the blood of the great Sacrifice can wash away every stain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lead me in thy truth - In the way which thou regardest as truth, or which thou seest to be true. Truth is eternal and unchanging. What God sees and regards as truth is true, because he sees things as they are; and when we have the divine estimate of anything, we understand what the thing is. It is not that he makes it to be true, but that he sees it to be true. Such is the perfection of His nature that we have the utmost assurance that what God regards as truth is truth; what He proclaims to be right is right. It is then His truth, as He adopts it for the rule of His own conduct, and makes it known to His creatures to guide them.<p>And teach me - Since this would be understood by the psalmist, it would be a prayer that God would teach him by His law as then made known; by His Spirit in the heart; by the dispensations of His providence. As applicable to us, it is a prayer that He would instruct us by all the truths then made known, and all that have since been revealed; by His Spirit in its influences on our hearts; by the events which are occurring around us; by the "accumulated" truth of ages; the knowledge which by all the methods He employs He has imparted to people for their guidance and direction.<p>For thou art the God of my salvation - The word "salvation" is not to be understood here in the sense in which it is now commonly used, as denoting deliverance from sin and future ruin, but in the more general sense of "deliverance" - deliverance from danger and death. The phrase is synonymous with "preservation," and the idea is that the psalmist regarded God as his preserver; or that he owed his protection and safety in the time of danger to Him alone.<p>On thee do I wait - That is, I rely on Thee; or, I am dependent on Thee. He had no other source of reliance or dependence.<p>All the day - Continually, always. He was really dependent upon Him at all times, and he felt that dependence. It is always true that we are dependent upon God for everything; it is not true that we always feel this. It was a characteristic of the piety of the psalmist that he did feel this. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

These are called &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, doors of eternity (not "of the world" as Luther renders it contrary to the Old Testament usage of the language) either as doors which pious faith hopes will last for ever, as Hupfeld and Hitzig explain it, understanding them, in opposition to the inscription of the Psalm, to be the gates of Solomon's Temple; or, what seems to us much more appropriate in the mouth of those who are now standing before the gates, as the portals dating back into the hoary ages of the past (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>), the time of the Jebusites, and even of Melchizedek, though which the King of Glory, whose whole being and acts is glory, is now about to enter. It is the gates of the citadel of Zion, to which the cry is addressed, to expand themselves in a manner worthy of the Lord who is about to enter, for whom they are too low and too strait. Rejoicing at the great honour, thus conferred upon them, they are to raise their heads (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>), i.e., lift up their portals (lintels); the doors of antiquity are to open high and wide.<p>(Note: On the Munach instead of Metheg in &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, vid., Baer's Accentsystem vii. 2.)<p>Then the question echoes back to the festal procession from Zion's gates which are wont only to admit mighty lords: who, then (&#1494;&#1492; giving vividness to the question, Ges. 122, 2), is this King of Glory; and they describe Him more minutely: it is the Hero-god, by whom Israel has wrested this Zion from the Jebusites with the sword, and by whom he has always been victorious in time past. The adjectival climactic form &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; (like &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, with &#305;&#774; instead of the a&#774; in &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1511;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) is only found in one other passage, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; refers back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>. Thus then shall the gates raise their heads and the ancient doors lift themselves, i.e., open high and wide; and this is expressed here by Kal instead of Niph. (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; to lift one's self up, rise, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>), according to the well-known order in which recurring verses and refrain-like repetitions move gently onwards. The gates of Zion ask once more, yet now no longer hesitatingly, but in order to hear more in praise of the great King. It is now the enquiry seeking fuller information; and the heaping up of the pronouns (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a>) expresses its urgency (quis tandem, ecquisnam). The answer runs, "Jahve Tsebaoth, He is the King of Glory (now making His entry)." &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492; is the proper name of Jahve as King, which had become His customary name in the time of the kings of Israel. &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is a genitive governed by &#1492; and, while it is otherwise found only in reference to human hosts, in this combination it gains, of itself, the reference to the angels and the stars, which are called &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a> : Jahve's hosts consisting of celestial heroes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>, and of stars standing on the plain of the havens as it were in battle array, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a> -a reference for which experiences and utterances like those recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-20.htm">Judges 5:20</a>, have prepared the way. It is, therefore, the Ruler commanding innumerable and invincible super-terrestrial powers, who desires admission. The gates are silent and open wide; and Jahve, sitting enthroned above the Cherubim of the sacred Ark, enters into Zion. </body></html>
