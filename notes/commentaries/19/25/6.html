It is certain that none who, by a believing attendance, wait on God, and, by a believing hope, wait for him, shall be ashamed of it. The most advanced believer both needs and desires to be taught of God. If we sincerely desire to know our duty, with resolution to do it, we may be sure that God will direct us in it. The psalmist is earnest for the pardon of his sins. When God pardons sin, he is said to remember it no more, which denotes full remission. It is God's goodness, and not ours, his mercy, and not our merit, that must be our plea for the pardon of sin, and all the good we need. This plea we must rely upon, feeling our own unworthiness, and satisfied of the riches of God's mercy and grace. How boundless is that mercy which covers for ever the sins and follies of a youth spent without God and without hope! Blessed be the Lord, the blood of the great Sacrifice can wash away every stain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember, O Lord - That is, In thy future treatment of me, bring to remembrance what thou hast done, and treat me in the same manner still. The language is that of one who felt that God had always been kind and gracious, and who asked for the future a continuance of the favors of the past. If we would recall, the goodness of God in the past, we should find enough to lay the foundation of prayer in reference to that which is to come. If we saw and fully understood all that has happened to us, we would need to offer no other prayer than that God might deal with us in the future as He has done in the past.<p>Thy tender mercies - Margin, as in Hebrew: "thy bowels." The Hebrew word means the "inner parts" regarded by the Hebrews as the seat of the affections. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>.<p>And thy loving-kindnesses - Thy tokens of favor; thy acts of mercy and compassion.<p>For they have been ever of old - "For from eternity are they." The language is that of a heart deeply impressed with a sense of the goodness God. In looking over his own life, the author of the psalm saw that the mercies of God had been unceasing and constant toward him from his earliest years. In words expressive of warm love and gratitude, therefore, he says that those acts of mercy had never failed - had been from eternity. His thoughts rise from the acts of God toward himself to the character of God, and to His attributes of mercy and love; and his heart is full of the idea that God is "always" good; that it belongs to His very nature to do good. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7.

Not the providential mercy and kindness of God, in the care of him in his mother's womb, at the time of his birth, in his nurture and education, and in the preservation of him to the present time; but the special mercy, grace, and love of God in Christ: the sense of the petition is the same with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-4.htm">Psalm 106:4</a>; which are expressed in the plural number, because of the largeness and abundance of it, and because of the various acts and instances of it; the Lord is rich and plenteous in mercy, abundant in goodness; his love is exceeding great, and numerous are the ways and methods in which it is declared, both in eternity and in time; and though he can never forget his love, nor the people whom he loves, for they are engraven on his hand, and set as a seal on his heart; yet he sometimes seems, by the conduct of his providence, as if he did not remember it, and had no tender affection for them; and their unbelief is ready to say, the Lord has forgotten to be gracious; and the design of such a petition as this is to entreat a fresh discovery and application of the grace, mercy, and loving kindness of God, and which he allows his people to put him in remembrance of; <p>for they have been ever of old: meaning not only from the time of his birth, and in after appearances of God for him, nor the favours shown to the people of Israel in former times at the Red sea, and in the wilderness and elsewhere, and to the patriarchs from the beginning of the world; but the love of God from everlasting, which appears in the choice of his people in Christ, before the foundation of the world, in the everlasting covenant of grace made with him, and in the setting of him up as the Mediator of it, and in putting his people into his hands, with all grace and spiritual blessings for them before the world began; and which love as it is from everlasting it is to everlasting, and remains invariably the same. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

These are called &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, doors of eternity (not "of the world" as Luther renders it contrary to the Old Testament usage of the language) either as doors which pious faith hopes will last for ever, as Hupfeld and Hitzig explain it, understanding them, in opposition to the inscription of the Psalm, to be the gates of Solomon's Temple; or, what seems to us much more appropriate in the mouth of those who are now standing before the gates, as the portals dating back into the hoary ages of the past (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>), the time of the Jebusites, and even of Melchizedek, though which the King of Glory, whose whole being and acts is glory, is now about to enter. It is the gates of the citadel of Zion, to which the cry is addressed, to expand themselves in a manner worthy of the Lord who is about to enter, for whom they are too low and too strait. Rejoicing at the great honour, thus conferred upon them, they are to raise their heads (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>), i.e., lift up their portals (lintels); the doors of antiquity are to open high and wide.<p>(Note: On the Munach instead of Metheg in &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, vid., Baer's Accentsystem vii. 2.)<p>Then the question echoes back to the festal procession from Zion's gates which are wont only to admit mighty lords: who, then (&#1494;&#1492; giving vividness to the question, Ges. 122, 2), is this King of Glory; and they describe Him more minutely: it is the Hero-god, by whom Israel has wrested this Zion from the Jebusites with the sword, and by whom he has always been victorious in time past. The adjectival climactic form &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; (like &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, with &#305;&#774; instead of the a&#774; in &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, &#1511;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) is only found in one other passage, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; refers back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>. Thus then shall the gates raise their heads and the ancient doors lift themselves, i.e., open high and wide; and this is expressed here by Kal instead of Niph. (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; to lift one's self up, rise, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>), according to the well-known order in which recurring verses and refrain-like repetitions move gently onwards. The gates of Zion ask once more, yet now no longer hesitatingly, but in order to hear more in praise of the great King. It is now the enquiry seeking fuller information; and the heaping up of the pronouns (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a>) expresses its urgency (quis tandem, ecquisnam). The answer runs, "Jahve Tsebaoth, He is the King of Glory (now making His entry)." &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492; is the proper name of Jahve as King, which had become His customary name in the time of the kings of Israel. &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is a genitive governed by &#1492; and, while it is otherwise found only in reference to human hosts, in this combination it gains, of itself, the reference to the angels and the stars, which are called &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a> : Jahve's hosts consisting of celestial heroes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>, and of stars standing on the plain of the havens as it were in battle array, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a> -a reference for which experiences and utterances like those recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-20.htm">Judges 5:20</a>, have prepared the way. It is, therefore, the Ruler commanding innumerable and invincible super-terrestrial powers, who desires admission. The gates are silent and open wide; and Jahve, sitting enthroned above the Cherubim of the sacred Ark, enters into Zion. </body></html>
