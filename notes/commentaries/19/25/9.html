We value a promise by the character of him that makes it; we therefore depend upon God's promises. All the paths of the Lord, that is, all his promises and all his providences, are mercy and truth. In all God's dealings his people may see his mercy displayed, and his word fulfilled, whatever afflictions they are now exercised with. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth; and so it will appear when they come to their journey's end. Those that are humble, that distrust themselves, and desire to be taught and to follow Divine guidance, these he will guide in judgment, that is, by the rule of the written word, to find rest for their souls in the Saviour. Even when the body is sick, and in pain, the soul may be at ease in God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meek will he guide - The humble, the teachable, the prayerful, the gentle of spirit - those who are willing to learn. A proud person who supposes that he already knows enough cannot be taught; a haughty person who has no respect for others, cannot learn of them; a person who is willing to believe nothing cannot be instructed. The first requisite, therefore, in the work of religion, as in respect to all kinds of knowledge, is a meek and docile spirit. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>.<p>In judgment - In a right judgment or estimate of things. It is not merely in the administration of justice, or in doing "right," but it is in judging of truth; of duty; of the value of objects; of the right way to live; of all upon which the mind can be called to exercise judgment, or to come to a decision.<p>And the meek will he teach his way - The way in which he would have them to go. The "methods" by which God does this are:<p>(1) By His word or law,<p>(a) laying down there the principles which are to guide human conduct, and<p>(b) in numerous cases furnishing specific rules for directing our conduct in the relations of life;<p>(2) by His Spirit,<p>(a) disposing the mind to candor,<p>(b) enlightening it to see the truth, and<p>(c) making it honest and sincere in its inquiries;<p>(3) by His providence - often indicating, in an unexpected manner, to those who are sincere in their inquiries after truth and duty, what He would have them to do; and<p>(4) by the advice and counsel of those who have experience - the aged and the wise - those who have themselves been placed in similar circumstances, or who have passed through the same perplexities and embarrassments.<p>By all these methods a peson who goes to God in humble prayer, and with a proper sense of dependence, may trust that he will be guided aright; and it is not probable that a case could occur in which one who should honestly seek for guidance by these helps, might not feel assured that God would lead him aright. Having used these means, a peson may feel assured that God will not leave him to error. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. in judgment&#8212;rightly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The meek, </span> i.e. the humble and lowly, such as meekly submit themselves to God’s hand and word, and are willing and desirous to be directed and governed by him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In judgment, </span> i.e. in the paths of judgment; or in the right way wherein they should walk, as the next clause explains this; or by the rule of his word, which is oft called <span class="ital">his judgment</span>, or <span class="ital">judgments</span>.
