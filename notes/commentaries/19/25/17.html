It is good thus to hope, and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. And if God turns to us, no matter who turns from us. He pleads his own integrity. Though guilty before God, yet, as to his enemies, he had the testimony of conscience that he had done them no wrong. God would, at length, give Israel rest from all their enemies round about. In heaven, God's Israel will be perfectly redeemed from all troubles. Blessed Saviour, thou hast graciously taught us that without thee we can do nothing. Do thou teach us how to pray, how to appear before thee in the way which thou shalt choose, and how to lift up our whole hearts and desires after thee, for thou art the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The troubles of my heart - The sorrows which spring upon the heart - particularly from the recollections of sin.<p>Are enlarged - Have become great.

These two things, external trouble and the inward consciousness of guilt, are not infrequently combined. Outward trouble has a tendency to bring up the remembrance of past transgressions, and to suggest the inquiry whether the affliction is not a divine visitation for sin. Any one source of sorrow may draw along numerous others in its train. The laws of association are such that when the mind rests on one source of joy, and is made cheerful by that, numerous other blessings will be suggested to increase the joy; and when one great sorrow has taken possession of the soul, all the lesser sorrows of the past life cluster around it, so that we seem to ourselves to be wholly abandoned by God and by man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-19.

His enemies being increased, which troubled him; the floods of ungodly men made him afraid; the waters of affliction were come into his soul, and spread themselves, and threatened to overwhelm him: or it may be rendered, as by some, "troubles have enlarged my heart" (h); made him wiser, increased his knowledge and experience; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67</a>; but the former seems better to agree with what follows; <p>O bring thou me out of my distresses; or "straits" (i); for the enlargement of his troubles was the straitening of his heart; and therefore he applies to the Lord to bring him out of his afflicted circumstances, in which he was penned up, as in a strait place, on every side, and which were such that he could not free himself from; but he knew that God could deliver him. <p>(h) "dilataverunt cor meum", Vatablus; "reddiderunt cor meum latius", Gussetius, p. 786.

The verb rendered <span class="ital">are enlarged</span> cannot mean ‘augmented.’ It is all but certain that the consonants should be divided and vocalised differently, giving the appropriate sense, The straitnesses of my heart enlarge thou, and bring me &c.: i.e. relieve my distress.

Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.</span> The affliction, of whatever kind it may have been, was regarded by David as a punishment sent on him for his sins. Of his sins he was at this time deeply conscious (vers. 7, 11) and deeply repentant. Probably they included his great sin (see the comment on ver. 11). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The perf. consec. is attached to the &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, which is, according to the sense, implied in &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498;, just as in other instances it follows adverbial members of a clause, placed first for the sake of emphasis, when those members have reference to the future, Ges. &#1431;126, rem. 1.

A great and multiform load of sin lies upon him, but the name of God, i.e., His nature that has become manifest in His mercy and truth, permits him to ask and to hope for forgiveness, not for the sake of anything whatever that he has done, but just for the sake of this name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-7.htm">Jeremiah 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>).
