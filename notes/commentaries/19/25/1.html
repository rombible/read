It is certain that none who, by a believing attendance, wait on God, and, by a believing hope, wait for him, shall be ashamed of it. The most advanced believer both needs and desires to be taught of God. If we sincerely desire to know our duty, with resolution to do it, we may be sure that God will direct us in it. The psalmist is earnest for the pardon of his sins. When God pardons sin, he is said to remember it no more, which denotes full remission. It is God's goodness, and not ours, his mercy, and not our merit, that must be our plea for the pardon of sin, and all the good we need. This plea we must rely upon, feeling our own unworthiness, and satisfied of the riches of God's mercy and grace. How boundless is that mercy which covers for ever the sins and follies of a youth spent without God and without hope! Blessed be the Lord, the blood of the great Sacrifice can wash away every stain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul - In meditation; in gratitude; in praise. The idea is, that the thoughts are lifted up from earth and earthly subjects to God. This is the beginning of the meditation; this gives character, perhaps, to the psalm. The state of mind is that of one who turns cheerfully away from earthly themes, and opens his mind to more lofty and hallowed influences. The mind begins with God; and, beginning with this, the current of thought is allowed to flow on, gathering up such ideas as would come in under this general purpose. Opening the mind to this influence, thoughts would flow in upon the soul embracing a wide range, and perhaps not very closely connected among themselves, but all of which would be fitted to raise the heart to God in meditation, thankfulness, and praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 25<p>Ps 25:1-22. The general tone of this Psalm is that of prayer for help from enemies.

When the storm-winds are out, the Lord's vessels put about and make for their well-remembered harbour of refuge. What a mercy that the Lord will condescend to hear our cries in time of trouble, although we may have almost forgotten him in our hours of fancied prosperity. "Unto thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul." It is but mockery to uplift the hands and the eyes unless we also bring our souls into our devotions. True prayer may be described as the soul rising from earth to have fellowship with heaven; it is taking a journey upon Jacob's ladder, leaving our cares and fears at the foot, and meeting with a covenant God at the top. Very often the soul cannot rise, she has lost her wings, and is heavy and earth-bound; more like a burrowing mole than a soaring eagle. At such dull seasons we must not give over prayer, but must, by God's assistance, exert all our power to lift up our hearts. Let faith be the lever and grace be the arm, and the dead lump will yet be stirred. But what a lift it has sometimes proved! With all our tugging and straining we have been utterly defeated, until the heavenly loadstone of our Saviour's love has displayed its omnipotent attractions, and then our hearts have gone up to our Beloved like mounting flames of fire.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a><p>"O my God." This title is more dear and near than the name Jehovah, which is used in the first sentence. Already the sweet singer has drawn nearer to his heavenly helper, for he makes bold to grasp him with the hand of assured possession, calling him, my God. Oh the more than celestial music of that word - "my God!" It is to be observed that the Psalmist does not deny expression to those gracious feelings with which God had favoured him; he does not fall into loathsome mock modesty, but finding in his soul a desire to seek the Lord he avows it; believing that he had a rightful interest in Jehovah he declares it, and knowing that he had confidence in his God he professes it; "O my God, I trust in thee." Faith is the cable which binds our boat to the shore, and by pulling at it we draw ourselves to the land; faith unites us to God, and then draws us near to him. As long as the anchor of faith holds there is no fear in the worst tempest; if that should fail us there would be no hope left. We must see to it that our faith is sound and strong, for otherwise prayer cannot prevail with God. Woe to the warrior who throws away his shield; what defence can be found for him who finds no defence in God? "Let me not be ashamed." Let not my disappointed hopes makes me feel ashamed of my former testimonies to thy faithfulness. Many were on the watch for this. The best of men have their enemies, and should pray against them that they may not see their wicked desires accomplished. "Let not mine enemies triumph over me." Suffer no wicked mouth to make blasphemous mirth out of my distresses by asking "Where is thy God?" There is a great jealousy in believers for the honour of God, and they cannot endure that unbelievers should taunt them with the failure of their expectations from the God of their salvation. All other trusts will end in disappointment and eternal shame, but our confidences shall never be confounded.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a><p>"Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed." Suffering enlarges the heart by creating the power to sympathize. If we pray eagerly for ourselves, we shall not long be able to forget our fellow-sufferers. None pity the poor like those who have been or are still poor, none have such tenderness for the sick as those who have been long in ill health themselves. We ought to be grateful for occasional griefs if they preserve us from chronic hard-heartedness; for of all afflictions, an unkind heart is the worst, it is a plague to its possessor, and a torment to those around him. Prayer when it is of the Holy Ghost's teaching is never selfish; the believer does not sue for monopolies for himself, but would have all in like case to partake of divine mercy with him. The prayer may be viewed as a promise; our Heavenly Father will never let his trustful children find him untrue or unkind. He will ever be mindful of his covenant. "Let them be ashamed which transgress without cause." David had given his enemies no provocation; their hatred was wanton. Sinners have no justifiable reason or valid excuse for transgressing; they benefit no one, not even themselves by their sins; the law against which they transgress is not harsh or unjust; God is not a tyrannical ruler, providence is not a bondage: men sin because they will sin, not because it is either profitable or reasonable to do so. Hence shame is their fitting reward. May they blush with penitential shame now, or else they will not be able to escape the everlasting contempt and the bitter shame which is the promotion of fools in the world to come.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a><p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm seems to have been composed when David was under some straits and pressures, when his outward afflictions were accompanied with inward horrors of conscience for his sins, by which he had forfeited God’s favour, and procured these calamities to himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>David, being distressed by his enemies, taketh his refuge in God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/25-1.htm" title="To you, O LORD, do I lift up my soul....">Psalm 25:1-6</a></span>; prayeth for the remission of the sins of his youth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/25-1.htm" title="To you, O LORD, do I lift up my soul....">Psalm 25:1-7</a></span>.

A Talmudic teacher, B. Berachoth 35a, infers from this passage the duty of prayer before meat: He who eats without giving thanks is like one who lays hands upon &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (the sacred things of God); the right to eat is only obtained by prayer.)<p>For He, &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, is the owner of the world, because its Creator. He has founded it upon seas, i.e., the ocean and its streams, &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>); for the waters existed before the dry land, and this has been cast up out of them at God's word, so that consequently the solid land, - which indeed also conceals in its interior a &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), - rising above the surface of the sea, has the waters, as it were, for its foundation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-6.htm">Psalm 136:6</a>), although it would more readily sink down into them than keep itself above them, if it were not in itself upheld by the creative power of God. Hereupon arises the question, who may ascend the mountain of Jahve, and stand above in His holy place? The futures have a potential signification: who can have courage to do it? what, therefore, must he be, whom Jahve receives into His fellowship, and with whose worship He is well-pleased? Answer: he must be one innocent in his actions and pure in mind, one who does not lift up his soul to that which is vain (&#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, according to the Masora with Waw minusculum).

Nor does Aben-Ezra, whom Norzi has misunderstood, by any means reverse the relation of the Chethb and Ker; to him &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is the Ker, and he explains it as a metaphor (an anthropomorphism): &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1497; &#1491;&#1493;&#1498; &#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;. Elias Levita is the only one who rejects the Ker &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; but he does so though misunderstanding a Masora (vid., Baer's Psalterium p. 130) and not without admitting Masoretic testimony in favour of it (&#1493;&#1499;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1495;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;). He is the only textual critic who rejects it. For Jacob b. Chajim is merely astonished that &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is not to be found in the Masoreth register of words written with Waw and to be read with Jod. And even Norzi does not reject this Ker, which he is obliged to admit has greatly preponderating testimony in its favour, and he would only too gladly get rid of it.)<p>Even the lxx Cod. Alex. translates: &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; whereas Cod. Vat.

Critically it is just as intangible, as it is exegetically incomprehensible; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; might then be equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, an explanation, however, which does not seem possible even from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>. We let this Ker&#1502; alone to its undisturbed critical rights. But that the poet did actually write thus, is incredible.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a> (just as at the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-5</a>), in continued predicates, we are told the character of the man, who is worthy of this privilege, to whom the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> refers. Such an one shall bear away, or acquire (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>) blessing from Jahve and righteousness from the God of his salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-9.htm">Psalm 27:9</a>). Righteousness, i.e., conformity to God and that which is well-pleasing to God, appears here as a gift, and in this sense it is used interchangeably with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a>). It is the righteousness of God after which the righteous, but not the self-righteous, man hungers and thirsts; that moral perfection which is the likeness of God restored to him and at the same time brought about by his own endeavours; it is the being changed, or transfigured, into the image of the Holy One Himself. With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-5.htm">Psalm 24:5</a> the answer to the question of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a> is at an end; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a> adds that those thus qualified, who may accordingly expect to receive God's gifts of salvation, are the true church of Jahve, the Israel of God. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (lit., a revolution, Arabic dahr, root &#1491;&#1512;, to turn, revolve) is used here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-15.htm">Psalm 73:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, of a collective whole, whose bond of union is not contemporaneousness, but similarity of disposition; and it is an alliteration with the &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; (Chethb &#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1493;, without the Jod plur.) which follows. &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; is a second genitive depending on &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>. Here at the close the predication passes into the form of invocation (Thy face). And &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; is a summarising predicate: in short, these are Jacob, not merely after the flesh, but after the spirit, and thus in truth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). By interpolating &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, as is done in the lxx and Peshto, and adopted by Ewald, Olshausen, Hupfeld, and Bttcher, the nerve, as it were, of the assertion is cut through. The predicate, which has been expressed in different ways, is concentrated intelligibly enough in the one word &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, towards which it all along tends. And here the music becomes forte. The first part of this double Psalm dies away amidst the playing of the instruments of the Levitical priests; for the Ark was brought in &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>) is to be read. </body></html>
