I think both these senses are included in the expiation which the psalmist prays for; as the person whose leprosy was expiated was wholly cured of his disease, and freed from all the incapacities attending it.” — Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:7-15 Purge me with hyssop, with the blood of Christ applied to my soul by a lively faith, as the water of purification was sprinkled with a bunch of hyssop. The blood of Christ is called the blood of sprinkling, Heb 12:24. If this blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin, cleanse us from our sin, then we shall be clean indeed, Heb 10:2. He asks not to be comforted, till he is first cleansed; if sin, the bitter root of sorrow, be taken away, he can pray in faith, Let me have a well-grounded peace, of thy creating, so that the bones broken by convictions may rejoice, may be comforted. Hide thy face from my sins; blot out all mine iniquities out of thy book; blot them out, as a cloud is blotted out and dispelled by the beams of the sun. And the believer desires renewal to holiness as much as the joy of salvation. David now saw, more than ever, what an unclean heart he had, and sadly laments it; but he sees it is not in his own power to amend it, and therefore begs God would create in him a clean heart. When the sinner feels this change is necessary, and reads the promise of God to that purpose, he begins to ask it. He knew he had by his sin grieved the Holy Spirit, and provoked him to withdraw. This he dreads more than anything. He prays that Divine comforts may be restored to him. When we give ourselves cause to doubt our interest in salvation, how can we expect the joy of it? This had made him weak; he prays, I am ready to fall, either into sin or into despair, therefore uphold me with thy Spirit. Thy Spirit is a free Spirit, a free Agent himself, working freely. And the more cheerful we are in our duty, the more constant we shall be to it. What is this but the liberty wherewith Christ makes his people free, which is contrasted with the yoke of bondage? Ga 5:1. It is the Spirit of adoption spoken to the heart. Those to whom God is the God of salvation, he will deliver from guilt; for the salvation he is the God of, is salvation from sin. We may therefore plead with him, Lord, thou art the God of my salvation, therefore deliver me from the dominion of sin. And when the lips are opened, what should they speak but the praises of God for his forgiving mercy?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean - On the word hyssop, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>; notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>. The plant or herb was much used by the Hebrews in their sacred purifications and sprinklings: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-6.htm">Leviticus 14:6</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-49.htm">Leviticus 14:49</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-51.htm">Leviticus 14:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>. Under this name the Hebrews seem to have comprised not only the common "hyssop" of the shops, but also other aromatic plants, as mint, wild marjoram, etc. - Gesenius, "Lexicon" The idea of the psalmist here evidently is not that the mere sprinkling with hyssop would make him clean; but he prays for that cleansing of which the sprinkling with hyssop was an emblem, or which was designed to be represented by that. The whole structure of the psalm implies that he was seeking an "internal" change, and that he did not depend on any mere outward ordinance or rite. The word rendered "purge" is from the word &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;  cha&#770;t&#803;a&#770;' - which means "to sin." In the Piel form it means to bear the blame (or "loss") for anything; and then to "atone for, to make atonement, to expiate:" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-39.htm">Genesis 31:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-19.htm">Numbers 19:19</a>. Here it conveys the notion of cleansing from sin "by" a sacred rite, or by that which was signified by a sacred rite. The idea was that the sin was to be removed or taken away, so that he might be free from it, or that "that" might be accomplished which was represented by the sprinkling with hyssop, and that the soul might be made pure. Luther has rendered it with great force - Entsundige mich mit Ysop - "Unsin me with hyssop."<p>Wash me - That is, cleanse me. Sin is represented as "defiling," and the idea of "washing" it away is often employed in the Scriptures. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>.<p>And I shall be whiter than snow - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>. The prayer is, that he might be made "entirely" clean; that there might be no remaining pollution in his soul. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-12.

A bunch of hyssop, some common herb which grew upon walls (Tristram, <span class="ital">Nat.

Washing of the person and clothes regularly formed part of the rites of purification.

Concerning the interchangeable names for sin, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>. Although the primary occasion of the Psalm is the sin of adultery, still David says &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;, not merely because many other sins were developed out of it, as his guilt of blood in the case of Uriah, the scandal put into the mouths of the enemies of Jahve, and his self-delusion, which lasted almost a whole year; but also because each solitary sin, the more it is perceived in its fundamental character and, as it were, microscopically discerned, all the more does it appear as a manifold and entangled skein of sins, and stands forth in a still more intimate and terrible relation, as of cause and effect, to the whole corrupt and degenerated condition in which the sinner finds himself. In &#1502;&#1495;&#1492; sins are conceived of as a cumulative debt (according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-22.htm">Isaiah 44:22</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>, like a thick, dark cloud) written down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>) against the time of the payment by punishment.
