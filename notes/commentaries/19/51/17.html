But as they cannot make satisfaction for sin, so God cannot take any satisfaction in them, otherwise than as expressing love and duty to him. The good work wrought in every true penitent, is a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, and sorrow for sin. It is a heart that is tender, and pliable to God's word. Oh that there were such a heart in every one of us! God is graciously pleased to accept this; it is instead of all burnt-offering and sacrifice. The broken heart is acceptable to God only through Jesus Christ; there is no true repentance without faith in him. Men despise that which is broken, but God will not. He will not overlook it, he will not refuse or reject it; though it makes God no satisfaction for the wrong done to him by sin. Those who have been in spiritual troubles, know how to pity and pray for others afflicted in like manner. David was afraid lest his sin should bring judgements upon the city and kingdom. No personal fears or troubles of conscience can make the soul, which has received grace, careless about the interests of the church of God. And let this be the continued joy of all the redeemed, that they have redemption through the blood of Christ, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sacrifices of God - The sacrifices which God desires and approves; the sacrifices without which no other offering would be acceptable. David felt that that which he here specified was what was demanded in his case. He had grievously sinned; and the blood of animals offered in sacrifice could not put away his sin, nor could anything remove it unless the heart were itself penitent and contrite. The same thing is true now. Though a most perfect sacrifice, every way acceptable to God, has been made for human guilt by the Redeemer, yet it is as true as it was under the old dispensation in regard to the sacrifices there required, that even that will not avail for us unless we are truly penitent; unless we come before God with a contrite and humble heart.<p>Are a broken spirit - A mind broken or crushed under the weight of conscious guilt. The idea is that of a burden laid on the Soul until it is crushed and subdued.<p>A broken and a contrite heart - The word rendered contrite means to be broken or crushed, as when the bones are broken, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>; and then it is applied to the mind or heart as that which is crushed or broken by the weight of guilt. The word does not differ materially from the term "broken." The two together constitute intensity of expression.<p>Thou wilt not despise - Thou wilt not treat with contempt or disregard. That is, God would look upon them with favor, and to such a heart he would grant his blessing.

Praise is better than sacrifice (Ps 50:14), and implying faith, penitence, and love, glorifies God.

That is humbled under a sense of sin; has true repentance for it; is smitten, wounded, and broken with it, by the word of God in the hand of the Spirit, which is a hammer to break the rock in pieces; and that not merely in a legal, but in an evangelical way; grieving for sin as committed against a God of love; broken and melted down under a sense of it, in a view of pardoning grace; and mourning for it, while beholding a pierced and wounded Saviour: the sacrifices of such a broken heart and contrite spirit are the sacrifices God desires, approves, accepts of, and delights in; <p>a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise; but regard, and receive with pleasure; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-17.htm">Psalm 102:17</a>; the Lord binds up and heals such broken hearts and spirits, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>; he is nigh to such persons, looks upon them, has respect unto them, and comes and dwells among them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/51.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The sacrifices of God <i>are</i> a <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</span><p>(o) Which is a wounding of the heart, proceeding from faith, which seeks God for mercy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/51.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">The sacrifices of God</span>] Such as He desires and approves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">A broken spirit</span> and <span class="ital">a contrite heart</span> are those in which sorrow and affliction (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm" title="Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.">Psalm 51:8</a></span>) have done their work, and the obstinacy of pride has been replaced by the humility of penitence.

A clean heart that is not beclouded by sin and a consciousness of sin (for &#1500;&#1489; includes the conscience, Psychology, S. 134; tr. p. 160); a stedfast spirit (&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a>) is a spirit certain respecting his state of favour and well-grounded in it. David's prayer has reference to the very same thing that is promised by the prophets as a future work of salvation wrought by God the Redeemer on His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>); it has reference to those spiritual facts of experience which, it is true, could be experienced even under the Old Testament relatively and anticipatively, but to the actual realization of which the New Testament history, fulfilling ancient prophecy has first of all produced effectual and comprehensive grounds and motives, viz., &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; (&#1500;&#1489;  equals  &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). David, without distinguishing between them, thinks of himself as king, as Israelite, and as man. Consequently we are not at liberty to say that &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>), &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  equals  &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, is here the Spirit of grace in distinction from the Spirit of office. If Jahve should reject David as He rejected Saul, this would be the extreme manifestation of anger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>) towards him as king and as a man at the same time. The Holy Spirit is none other than that which came upon him by means of the anointing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>. This Spirit, by sin, he has grieved and forfeited. Hence he prays God to show favour rather than execute His right, and not to take this His Holy Spirit from him. </body></html>
