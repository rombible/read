The blood of Christ is called the blood of sprinkling, Heb 12:24. If this blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin, cleanse us from our sin, then we shall be clean indeed, Heb 10:2. He asks not to be comforted, till he is first cleansed; if sin, the bitter root of sorrow, be taken away, he can pray in faith, Let me have a well-grounded peace, of thy creating, so that the bones broken by convictions may rejoice, may be comforted. Hide thy face from my sins; blot out all mine iniquities out of thy book; blot them out, as a cloud is blotted out and dispelled by the beams of the sun. And the believer desires renewal to holiness as much as the joy of salvation. David now saw, more than ever, what an unclean heart he had, and sadly laments it; but he sees it is not in his own power to amend it, and therefore begs God would create in him a clean heart. When the sinner feels this change is necessary, and reads the promise of God to that purpose, he begins to ask it. He knew he had by his sin grieved the Holy Spirit, and provoked him to withdraw. This he dreads more than anything. He prays that Divine comforts may be restored to him. When we give ourselves cause to doubt our interest in salvation, how can we expect the joy of it? This had made him weak; he prays, I am ready to fall, either into sin or into despair, therefore uphold me with thy Spirit. Thy Spirit is a free Spirit, a free Agent himself, working freely. And the more cheerful we are in our duty, the more constant we shall be to it. What is this but the liberty wherewith Christ makes his people free, which is contrasted with the yoke of bondage? Ga 5:1. It is the Spirit of adoption spoken to the heart. Those to whom God is the God of salvation, he will deliver from guilt; for the salvation he is the God of, is salvation from sin. We may therefore plead with him, Lord, thou art the God of my salvation, therefore deliver me from the dominion of sin. And when the lips are opened, what should they speak but the praises of God for his forgiving mercy?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation - literally, "Cause the joy of thy salvation to return." This implies that he had formerly known what was the happiness of being a friend of God, and of having a hope of salvation. That joy had been taken from him by his sin. He had lost his peace of mind. His soul was sad and cheerless. Sin always produces this effect. The only way to enjoy religion is to do that which is right; the only way to secure the favor of God is to obey his commands; the only way in which we can have comforting evidence that we are his children is by doing that which shall be pleasing to him: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm">1 John 2:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>. The path of sin is a dark path, and in that path neither hope nor comfort can be found.<p>And uphold me with thy free spirit - That is, Sustain me; keep me from falling. The words ""with thy"" are not in the original, and there is nothing there to indicate that by the word "spirit" the psalmist refers to the Spirit of God, though it should be observed that there is nothing "against" such a supposition. The word rendered "free" - &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;  na&#770;d&#305;&#770;yb - means properly "willing, voluntary, ready, prompt;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-21.htm">1 Chronicles 28:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>. Then the word means liberal, generous, noble-minded; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-5.htm">Isaiah 32:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-8.htm">Isaiah 32:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-7.htm">Proverbs 17:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>. It would seem here to mean "a "willing" spirit," referring to David's own mind or spirit; and the prayer is, that God would uphold or sustain him "in" a "willing" spirit or state of mind; that is, a state of mind in which he would he "willing" and "ready" to obey all the commands of God, and to serve him faithfully. What he prayed for was grace and strength that he might be "kept" in a state of mind which would be constant and firm <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>, and a state in which he would always be found "willing" and ready to keep the commandments of God. It is a proper object of prayer by all that they may be always kept in a state of mind in which they will be willing to do all that God requires of them, and to bear all that may be laid on them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. free spirit&#8212;"thy" ought not to be supplied, for the word "free" is, literally, "willing," and "spirit" is that of David.

The declaration moves backwards from his birth to conception, it consequently penetrates even to the most remote point of life's beginning. &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; stands instead of &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, perhaps (although elsewhere, i.e., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, the idea of painfulness is kept entirely in the background) with reference to the decree, "with pain shalt thou bring forth children," <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a> (Kurtz); instead of &#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, with still more definite reference to that which precedes conception, the expression is &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; (for &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;, following the same interchange of vowel as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-39.htm">Genesis 30:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>). The choice of the verb decides the question whether by &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; is meant the guilt and sin of the child or of the parents. &#1497;&#1495;&#1501; (to burn with desire) has reference to that, in coition, which partakes of the animal, and may well awaken modest sensibilities in man, without &#1506;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; on that account characterizing birth and conception itself as sin; the meaning is merely, that his parents were sinful human begins, and that this sinful state (habitus) has operated upon his birth and even his conception, and from this point has passed over to him. What is thereby expressed is not so much any self-exculpation, as on the contrary a self-accusation which glances back to the ultimate ground of natural corruption. He is sinful &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-4.htm">Psalm 58:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>), is &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;, an unclean one springing from an unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>), flesh born of flesh. That man from his first beginning onwards, and that this beginning itself, is stained with sin; that the proneness to sin with its guilt and its corruption is propagated from parents to their children; and that consequently in the single actual sin the sin-pervaded nature of man, inasmuch as he allows himself to be determined by it and himself resolves in accordance with it, become outwardly manifest-therefore the fact of hereditary sin is here more distinctly expressed than in any other passage in the Old Testament, since the Old Testament conception, according to its special character, which always fastens upon the phenomenal, outward side rather than penetrates to the secret roots of a matter, is directed almost entirely to the outward manifestation only of sin, and leaves its natural foundation, its issue in relation to primeval history, and its demonic background undisclosed. The &#1492;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a> is followed by a correlative second &#1492;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-15.htm">Isaiah 54:15</a>.). Geier correctly says: Orat ut sibi in peccatis concepto veraque cordis probitate carenti penitiorem ac mysticam largiri velit sapientiam, cujus medio liberetur a peccati tum reatu tum dominio. &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is the nature and life of man as conformed to the nature and will of God (cf. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-21.htm">Ephesians 4:21</a>). &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, wisdom which is most intimately acquainted with (eindringlich weiss) such nature and life and the way to attain it. God delights in and desires truth &#1489;&#1496;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;. The Beth of this word is not a radical letter here as it is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>, but the preposition. The reins utpote adipe obducti, here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-36.htm">Job 38:36</a>, according to the Targum, Jerome, and Parchon, are called &#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (Psychol. S. 269; tr. p. 317). Truth in the reins (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-9.htm">Psalm 40:9</a>, God's law in visceribus meis) is an upright nature in man's deepest inward parts; and in fact, since the reins are accounted as the seat of the tenderest feelings, in man's inmost experience and perception, in his most secret life both of conscience and of mind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a>). In the parallel member &#1505;&#1514;&#1501; denotes the hidden inward part of man. Out of the confession, that according to the will of God truth ought to dwell and rule in man even in his reins, comes the wish, that God would impart to him (i.e., teach him and make his own), - who, as being born and conceived in sin, is commended to God's mercy, - that wisdom in the hidden part of his mind which is the way to such truth. </body></html>
