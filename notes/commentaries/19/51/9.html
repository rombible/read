Thus shall both my inward uncleanness be purged away, and I shall be prevented from falling again into such actual and scandalous <span class="ital">sins.

The blood of Christ is called the blood of sprinkling, Heb 12:24. If this blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin, cleanse us from our sin, then we shall be clean indeed, Heb 10:2. He asks not to be comforted, till he is first cleansed; if sin, the bitter root of sorrow, be taken away, he can pray in faith, Let me have a well-grounded peace, of thy creating, so that the bones broken by convictions may rejoice, may be comforted. Hide thy face from my sins; blot out all mine iniquities out of thy book; blot them out, as a cloud is blotted out and dispelled by the beams of the sun. And the believer desires renewal to holiness as much as the joy of salvation. David now saw, more than ever, what an unclean heart he had, and sadly laments it; but he sees it is not in his own power to amend it, and therefore begs God would create in him a clean heart. When the sinner feels this change is necessary, and reads the promise of God to that purpose, he begins to ask it. He knew he had by his sin grieved the Holy Spirit, and provoked him to withdraw. This he dreads more than anything. He prays that Divine comforts may be restored to him. When we give ourselves cause to doubt our interest in salvation, how can we expect the joy of it? This had made him weak; he prays, I am ready to fall, either into sin or into despair, therefore uphold me with thy Spirit. Thy Spirit is a free Spirit, a free Agent himself, working freely. And the more cheerful we are in our duty, the more constant we shall be to it. What is this but the liberty wherewith Christ makes his people free, which is contrasted with the yoke of bondage? Ga 5:1. It is the Spirit of adoption spoken to the heart. Those to whom God is the God of salvation, he will deliver from guilt; for the salvation he is the God of, is salvation from sin. We may therefore plead with him, Lord, thou art the God of my salvation, therefore deliver me from the dominion of sin. And when the lips are opened, what should they speak but the praises of God for his forgiving mercy?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hide thy face from my sins - That is, Do not look on them; avert thy face from them; do not regard them.

True penitence is not a dead knowledge of sin committed, but a living sensitive consciousness of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-12.htm">Isaiah 59:12</a>), to which it is ever present as a matter and ground of unrest and pain. This penitential sorrow, which pervades the whole man, is, it is true, no merit that wins mercy or favour, but it is the condition, without which it is impossible for any manifestation of favour to take place. Such true consciousness of sin contemplates sin, of whatever kind it may be, directly as sin against God, and in its ultimate ground as sin against Him alone (&#1495;&#1496;&#1488; with &#1500; of the person sinned against, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-9.htm">Micah 7:9</a>); for every relation in which man stands to his fellow-men, and to created things in general, is but the manifest form of his fundamental relationship to God; and sin is "that which is evil in the eyes of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-12.htm">Isaiah 65:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-4.htm">Isaiah 66:4</a>), it is contradiction to the will of God, the sole and highest Lawgiver and Judge. Thus it is, as David confesses, with regard to his sin, in order that... This &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; must not be weakened by understanding it to refer to the result instead of to the aim or purpose. If, however, it is intended to express intention, it follows close upon the moral relationship of man to God expressed in &#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; and &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, - a relationship, the aim of which is, that God, when He now condemns the sinner, may appear as the just and holy One, who, as the sinner is obliged himself to acknowledge, cannot do otherwise than pronounce a condemnatory decision concerning him. When sin becomes manifest to a man as such, he must himself say Amen to the divine sentence, just as David does to that passed upon him by Nathan. And it is just the nature of penitence so to confess one's self to be in the wrong in order that God may be in the right and gain His cause. If, however, the sinner's self-accusation justifies the divine righteousness or justice, just as, on the other hand, all self-justification on the part of the sinner (which, however, sooner or later will be undeceived) accuses God of unrighteousness or injustice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-8.htm">Job 40:8</a>): then all human sin must in the end tend towards the glorifying of God. In this sense <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a> is applied by Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>), inasmuch as he regards what is here written in the Psalter - &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5; (lxx) - as the goal towards which the whole history of Israel tends.

The thought remains essentially unchanged by the side of these deviations; and even the taking of the verb &#1494;&#1499;&#1492;, to be clean, pure, in the Syriac signification &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, does not alter it. That God may be justified in His decisive speaking and judging; that He, the Judge, may gain His cause in opposition to all human judgment, towards this tends David's confession of sin, towards this tends all human history, and more especially the history of Israel. </body></html>
