(See Stanley, <span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>chap. ii., p. 46, Note.) The word rendered <span class= "ital">conceived </span>is certainly one generally used of animal desire. (The marginal <span class= "ital">warm me </span>is erroneous.) But the verse is only a statement of the truth of experience so constantly affirmed in Scripture of hereditary corruption and the innate proneness to sin in every child of man. The argument for a personal origin to the psalm from this verse seems strong; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-1.htm" title="Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:">Psalm 129:1</a>, and frequently, the community is personified as an individual growing from youth to age, and so may here speak of its far-back idolatrous ancestry as the mother who conceived it in sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/51.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-5.htm" title="Behold, I was shaped in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.">Psalm 51:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, I was shapen in iniquity — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">חוללתי</span>, <span class="ital">cholaleti, I was born, </span>or <span class="ital">brought forth: </span>for it does not appear that the word ever signifies, <span class="ital">I was shapen; </span>and then the ensuing words will contain the reason of it; the sense being, <span class="ital">because in sin did my mother conceive me, therefore I was brought forth in iniquity; </span>that is, with great propensities and dispositions to sin. This verse is, both by Jewish and Christian, by ancient and later interpreters generally, and most justly, understood of what we call <span class="ital">original sin; </span>which David here mentions, not as an excuse for, but as an aggravation of, his transgression, inasmuch as the knowledge which he had of the total corruption of his nature, and its tendency to evil, ought to have made him more on his guard, and to have watched more carefully over his sensual passions and affections. And the sense of the place is this: Nor is this the only sin which I have reason to acknowledge and bewail before thee; for this filthy stream leads me to a corrupt fountain. And, upon a serious review of my heart and life, I find that I am guilty of innumerable other sins; and that this heinous crime, though drawn forth by external temptations, yet was indeed the proper fruit of my own vile nature, which, without the restraints of thy providence or grace, ever was and still will be inclinable and ready to commit ten thousand sins as occasion offers. Thus, as Dr. Dodd, after Chandler, justly observes, “The psalmist owns himself to be the corrupted, degenerate offspring, of corrupted, degenerate parents, agreeable to what was said long before he was born, <span class="ital">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm" title="Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.">Job 14:4</a>. Nor is it unusual with good men, when confessing their own sins before God, to make mention of the sins of their parents, for their greater mortification and humiliation.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:1-6 David, being convinced of his sin, poured out his soul to God in prayer for mercy and grace. Whither should backsliding children return, but to the Lord their God, who alone can heal them? he drew up, by Divine teaching, an account of the workings of his heart toward God. Those that truly repent of their sins, will not be ashamed to own their repentance. Also, he instructs others what to do, and what to say. David had not only done much, but suffered much in the cause of God; yet he flees to God's infinite mercy, and depends upon that alone for pardon and peace. He begs the pardon of sin. The blood of Christ, sprinkled upon the conscience, blots out the transgression, and, having reconciled us to God, reconciles us to ourselves. The believer longs to have the whole debt of his sins blotted out, and every stain cleansed; he would be thoroughly washed from all his sins; but the hypocrite always has some secret reserve, and would have some favorite lust spared. David had such a deep sense of his sin, that he was continually thinking of it, with sorrow and shame. His sin was committed against God, whose truth we deny by wilful sin; with him we deal deceitfully. And the truly penitent will ever trace back the streams of actual sin to the fountain of original depravity. He confesses his original corruption. This is that foolishness which is bound in the heart of a child, that proneness to evil, and that backwardness to good, which is the burden of the regenerate, and the ruin of the unregenerate. He is encouraged, in his repentance, to hope that God would graciously accept him. Thou desirest truth in the inward part; to this God looks, in a returning sinner. Where there is truth, God will give wisdom. Those who sincerely endeavour to do their duty shall be taught their duty; but they will expect good only from Divine grace overcoming their corrupt nature.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity - The object of this important verse is to express the deep sense which David had of his depravity. That sense was derived from the fact that this was not a sudden thought, or a mere outward act, or an offence committed under the influence of strong temptation, but that it was the result of an entire corruption of his nature - of a deep depravity of heart, running back to the very commencement of his being. The idea is, that he could not have committed this offence unless he had been thoroughly corrupt, and always corrupt. The sin was as heinous and aggravated "as if" in his very conception and birth there had been nothing but depravity. He looked at his, sin, and he looked back to his own origin, and he inferred that the one demonstrated that in the other there was no good thing, no tendency to goodness, no germ of goodness, but that there was evil, and only evil; as when one looks at a tree, and sees that it bears sour or poisonous fruit, he infers that it is in the very nature of the tree, and that there is nothing else in the tree, from its origin, but a tendency to produce just such fruit.<p>Of course, the idea here is not to cast reflections on the character of his mother, or to refer to her feelings in regard to his conception and birth, but the design is to express his deep sense of his own depravity; a depravity so deep as to demonstrate that it must have had its origin in the very beginning of his existence. The word rendered "I was shapen" - &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;  cho&#770;laletiy - is from a word - &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;  chu&#770;l - which means properly, "to turn around, to twist, to whirl;" and then it comes to mean "to twist oneself with pain, to writhe;" and then it is used especially with reference to the pains of childbirth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-7.htm">Isaiah 66:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>. That is the meaning here. The idea is simply that he was "born" in iniquity; or that he was a sinner when he was born; or that his sin could be traced back to his very birth - as one might say that he was born with a love of music, or with a love of nature, or with a sanguine, a phlegmatic, or a melancholy temperament.<p>There is not in the Hebrew word any idea corresponding to the word ""shapen,"" as if he had been "formed" or "moulded" in that manner by divine power; but the entire meaning of the word is exhausted by saying that his sin could be traced back to his "very birth;" that it was so deep and aggravated, that it could be accounted for - or that he could express his sense of it - in no other way, than by saying that he was "born a sinner." How that occurred, or how it was connected with the first apostasy in Adam, or how the fact that he was thus born could be vindicated, is not intimated, nor is it alluded to. There is no statement that the sin of another was "imputed" to him; or that he was "responsible" for the sin of Adam; or that he was guilty "on account of" Adam's sin, for on these points the psalmist makes no assertion. It is worthy of remark, further, that the psalmist did not endeavor to "excuse" his guilt on the ground that he was ""born"" in iniquity; nor did he allude to that fact with any purpose of "exculpating" himself. The fact that he was thus born only deepened his sense of his own guilt, or showed the enormity of the offence which was the regular result or outbreak of that carly depravity. The points, therefore, which are established by this expression of the psalmist, so far as the language is designed to illustrate how human nature is conceived, are<p>(1) that people are born with a propensity to sin; and<p>(2) that this fact does not excuse us in sin, but rather tends to aggravate and deepen our guilt.<p>The language goes no further than this in regard to the question of original sin or native depravity. The Septuagint agrees with this interpretation - &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  idou gar en anomias sunele&#772;fthe&#772;n. So the Vulgate: in iniquitatibus conceptus sum.<p>And in sin did my mother conceive me - Margin, as in Hebrew, "warm me." This language simply traces his sin back to the time when he began to exist. The previous expression traced it to "his birth;" this expression goes back to the very beginning of "life;" when there were the first indications of life. The idea is, "as soon as I began to exist I was a sinner; or, I had then a propensity to sin - a propensity, the sad proof and result of which is that enormous act of guilt which I have committed." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

This cannot be understood of any personal iniquity of his immediate parents; since this respects his wonderful formation in the womb, in which both he and they were wholly passive, as the word here used is of that form; and is the amazing work of God himself, so much admired by the psalmist, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13</a>; and cannot design any sinfulness then infused into him by his Maker, seeing God cannot be the author of sin; but of original sin and corruption, derived to him by natural generation: and the sense is, that as soon as ever the mass of human nature was shaped and quickened, or as soon as soul and body were united together, sin was in him, and he was in sin, or became a sinful creature; <p>and in sin did my mother conceive me; by whom cannot be meant Eve; for though she is the mother of all living, and so of David, yet could not, with any propriety, be said to conceive him: this only could be said of his immediate parent, not even of his next grandmother, much less of Eve, at the distance of almost three thousand years. Nor does the sin in which he was conceived intend any sin of his parents, in begetting and conceiving him, being in lawful wedlock; which acts cannot be sinful, since the propagation of the human species by natural generation is a principle of nature implanted by God himself; and is agreeably to the first law of nature, given to man in a state of innocence, "increase and multiply", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>. Marriage is the institution of God in paradise; and in all ages has been accounted "honourable in all, when the bed is undefiled", <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>. Nor does it design his being conceived when his mother was in "profluviis", of which there is no proof, and is a mere imagination, and can answer no purpose; much less that he was conceived in adultery, as the contenders for the purity of human nature broadly intimate; which shows how much they are convicted by this text, to give into such an interpretation of it, at the expense of the character of an innocent person, of whom there is not the least suggestion of this kind in the Holy Scriptures; but on the contrary, she is represented as a religious woman, and David valued himself upon his relation to her as such, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-16.htm">Psalm 86:16</a>. Besides, had this been the case, as David would have been a bastard, he would not have been suffered to enter into the congregation of the Lord, according to the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2</a>; whereas he often did with great delight, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>. Moreover, it is beside his scope and design to expose the sins of others, much less his own parents, while he is confessing and lamenting his own iniquities: and to what purpose should he mention theirs, especially if he himself was not affected by them, and did not derive a corrupt nature from them? Nor is the sin he speaks of any actual sin of his own, and therefore he does not call it, as before, "my" iniquity and "my" sin; though it was so, he having sinned in Adam, and this being in his nature; but "iniquity" and "sin", it being common to him with all mankind. Hence we learn the earliness of the corruption of nature; it is as soon as man is conceived and shapen; and that it is propagated from one to another by natural generation; and that it is the case of all men: for if this was the case of David, who was born of religious parents, was famous for his early piety, and from whose seed the Messiah sprung, it may well be concluded to be the case of all. And this corruption of nature is the fountain, source, and spring of all sin, secret and open, private and public; and is mentioned here not as an extenuation of David's actual transgressions, but as an aggravation of them; he having been, from his conception and formation, nothing else but a mass of sin, a lump of iniquity; and, in his evangelical repentance for them, he is led to take notice of and mourn over the corruption of his nature, from whence they arose. The Heathens themselves affirm, that no man is born without sin (c). <p>(c) "Nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur". Horat. Sermon. l. 1.

Acts of sin have their root in the inherited sinfulness of mankind. It does not appear, as some have thought, that the Psalmist pleads the sinifulness of his nature as an excuse for his actual sins. Rather, in utter self-abasement, he feels compelled to confess and bewail not only his actual sins, but the deep infection of his whole nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm" title="Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.">Job 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-18.htm" title="For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.">Romans 7:18</a>).

It has been hitherto for the first step in justification - the wiping out of past transgressions. It is now for restoration, for a renewal of spiritual life, for a return to God's favour, and to the spiritual joy involved in it. First, however, an additional confession is made (vers. 5, 6). Not only have I committed acts of sin (vers. 1-4), but sin is thoroughly ingrained into my nature. I was conceived in it; I was brought forth in it; only the strongest remedies can cleanse me from it (ver. 7). But cleansing alone is not enough. I need renewal (ver. 10); I need thy Holy Spirit (ver. 11); I crave, above all, the sense of a restoration to thy favour - a return to the old feelings of "joy and gladness" (ver. 8), even "the joy of thy salvation" (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I was shapen in iniquity;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in iniquity was I brought forth. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And in sin did my</span> <span class="cmt_word">mother conceive me.</span> It is doubtless true, as Professor Cheyne says, that "the Old Testament contains no theory of the origin of sin" - no formulated doctrine on the subject.

If we take &#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; as a thought complete in itself, - which is perfectly possible in a certain sense (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>), - then it is best explained according to the Vulgate (qui ordinat viam), with B&#1510;ttcher, Maurer, and Hupfeld: viam h. e. recta incedere (legel agere) parans; but the expression is inadequate to express this ethical sense (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>), and consequently is also without example.

Such an one prepares a way along which I will grant to him to see the salvation of Elohim, i.e., along which I will grant him a rapturous vision of the full reality of My salvation. The form &#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is without example elsewhere.

With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a> the Psalm recurs to its central point and climax, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>. What Jahve here discourses in a post-Sinaitic appearing, is the very same discourse concerning the worthlessness of dead works and concerning the true will of God that Jesus addresses to the assembled people when He enters upon His ministry. The cycle of the revelation of the Gospel is linked to the cycle of the revelation of the Law by the Sermon on the Mount; this is the point at which both cycles touch. </body></html>
