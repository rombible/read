According to this interpretation the psalmist, in these words, declares his hope that God would pardon and cure the folly which he had discovered, and make him wiser for the future.

Having then now said, for the aggravation of his sin, that God <span class="ital">required truth in the inward parts, </span>he takes occasion to break forth into prayer, which also he continues in the following verses.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/51.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>51:1-6 David, being convinced of his sin, poured out his soul to God in prayer for mercy and grace. Whither should backsliding children return, but to the Lord their God, who alone can heal them? he drew up, by Divine teaching, an account of the workings of his heart toward God. Those that truly repent of their sins, will not be ashamed to own their repentance. Also, he instructs others what to do, and what to say. David had not only done much, but suffered much in the cause of God; yet he flees to God's infinite mercy, and depends upon that alone for pardon and peace. He begs the pardon of sin. The blood of Christ, sprinkled upon the conscience, blots out the transgression, and, having reconciled us to God, reconciles us to ourselves. The believer longs to have the whole debt of his sins blotted out, and every stain cleansed; he would be thoroughly washed from all his sins; but the hypocrite always has some secret reserve, and would have some favorite lust spared. David had such a deep sense of his sin, that he was continually thinking of it, with sorrow and shame. His sin was committed against God, whose truth we deny by wilful sin; with him we deal deceitfully. And the truly penitent will ever trace back the streams of actual sin to the fountain of original depravity. He confesses his original corruption. This is that foolishness which is bound in the heart of a child, that proneness to evil, and that backwardness to good, which is the burden of the regenerate, and the ruin of the unregenerate. He is encouraged, in his repentance, to hope that God would graciously accept him. Thou desirest truth in the inward part; to this God looks, in a returning sinner. Where there is truth, God will give wisdom. Those who sincerely endeavour to do their duty shall be taught their duty; but they will expect good only from Divine grace overcoming their corrupt nature.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/51.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts - The word rendered "desirest," means to have pleasure in; to delight in; and the idea is that this only is agreeable to God, or this only accords with his own nature. The word rendered "inward parts," means properly the reins, and is usually employed to denote the seat of the mind, the feelings, the intellect. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-36.htm">Job 38:36</a>. The allusion is to the "soul;" and the idea is, that God could be satisfied with nothing "but" purity in the soul. The "connection" is this: David was deeply conscious of his own pollution; his deep, early, native depravity. This, in his own mind, he contrasted strongly with the nature of God, and with what God must require, and be pleased with. He "felt" that God could not approve of or love such a heart as his, so vile, so polluted, so corrupt; and he felt that it was necessary that he should have a pure heart in order to meet with the favor of a God so holy. But how was that to be obtained? His mind at once adverted to the fact that it could come only from God; and hence, the psalm now turns from confession to prayer. The psalmist pleads earnestly <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7-10</a> that God "would" thus cleanse and purify his soul.<p>And in the hidden part - In the secret part; the heart; the depths of the soul. The cleansing was to begin in that which was hidden from the eye of man; in the soul itself. Wisdom, heavenly, saving wisdom, was to have its seat there; the cleansing needed was not any mere outward purification, it was the purification of the soul itself.<p>Thou shalt make me to know wisdom - Thou only canst enable me to understand what is truly wise. This wisdom, this cleansing, this knowledge of the way in which a guilty man can be restored to favor, can be imparted only by thee; and "thou wilt do it." There is here, therefore, at the same time a recognition of the truth that this "must" come from God, and an act of faith, or a strong assurance that he "would" impart this. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/51.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. thou shalt make, &c.&#8212;may be taken to express God's gracious purpose in view of His strict requisition; a purpose of which David might have availed himself as a check to his native love for sin, and, in not doing so, aggravated his guilt.<p>truth &#8230; and &#8230;wisdom&#8212;are terms often used for piety (compare Job 28:28; Ps 119:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/51.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou desirest; </span> or, <span class="ital">delightest in</span>; or, <span class="ital">requirest</span>; Heb. <span class="ital">willest.

Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Integrity or uprightness of heart; which seem to be here opposed to that iniquity mentioned in the last verse, in which he was, and all men are, framed and born. And this may seem to be added, partly as a proof or aggravation of the sinfulness of original corruption, because it is contrary to the holy nature and will of God, which requireth not only unblamableness in men’s actions, but also universal innocency and rectitude of their minds and hearts; and partly as an aggravation of his actual sin, wherein he had used such gross deceit and treachery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the hidden part, </span> i.e. in the heart, called <span class="ital">the hidden man of the heart</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm" title="But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.">1 Peter 3:4</a></span>, and <span class="ital">the secret part</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a></span>, which in the former branch he called the reins or inward parts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou shalt make me to know:</span> so he declares his hope that God would pardon and cure his folly, which he had discovered, and make him wiser for the future. But this seems not to suit well with the context, which runs wholly in another strain. The word therefore is and may be rendered otherwise, <span class="ital">thou hast made me to know</span>. So this is another aggravation of his sin, that it was committed against that wisdom and knowledge, which God had not only revealed to him outwardly in his word, but also inwardly by his Spirit, writing it in his heart, according to his promise, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm" title="But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, said the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Jeremiah 31:33</a></span>.

Having now said, for the aggravation of his sin, that God did <span class="ital">desire</span> or <span class="ital">require truth in the inward parts</span>, he takes that occasion to break forth into prayer, which also he continues in the following verses. Only as he prays there for justification or pardon of sin, so here he prays for renovation or sanctification. So his meaning is this, <span class="ital">therefore</span> (as the particle and is oft used, as hath been showed) <span class="ital">in the hidden part do thou make me to know wisdom</span>. Or thus, <span class="ital">thou wouldest have me know</span>; for futures are oft taken potentially, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-6.htm" title="The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do to me?">Psalm 118:6</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-25.htm" title="And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:">Matthew 12:25</a></span>, compared with <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-24.htm" title="And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.">Mark 3:24</a></span>, and elsewhere. And verbs which signify <span class="ital">making</span> or <span class="ital">causing</span> are sometimes understood only of the will or command; as Jeroboam is said to <span class="ital">make Israel to sin</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-16.htm" title="And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.">1 Kings 14:16</a></span>, because he commanded them to do so, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-11.htm" title="Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.">Hosea 5:11</a></span>.

David begins to rise in the exercise of his faith in the grace of God, "thou shall make me to know", &amp;c. unless the words should be rendered as a prayer, as they are by some, "make me to know" (e), &amp;c. and as are the following. <p>(d) "delectaris", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "delectatus es", Cocceius; so Ainsworth.

In dead works God delighteth not, but whoso offereth thanksgiving (viz., not shelamim-to&#770;da, but the to&#770;da of the heart), he praises Him <p>(Note: In Vedic jag', old Bactrian jaz (whence jag'jas, the primitive word of &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), the notions of offering and of praising lie one within the other.)<p>and &#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;.

If we take &#1513;&#1474;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; as a thought complete in itself, - which is perfectly possible in a certain sense (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>), - then it is best explained according to the Vulgate (qui ordinat viam), with B&#1510;ttcher, Maurer, and Hupfeld: viam h. e. recta incedere (legel agere) parans; but the expression is inadequate to express this ethical sense (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>), and consequently is also without example. The lxx indicates the correct idea in the rendering &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;.

Such an one prepares a way along which I will grant to him to see the salvation of Elohim, i.e., along which I will grant him a rapturous vision of the full reality of My salvation.

With <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a> the Psalm recurs to its central point and climax, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>. What Jahve here discourses in a post-Sinaitic appearing, is the very same discourse concerning the worthlessness of dead works and concerning the true will of God that Jesus addresses to the assembled people when He enters upon His ministry. The cycle of the revelation of the Gospel is linked to the cycle of the revelation of the Law by the Sermon on the Mount; this is the point at which both cycles touch. </body></html>
