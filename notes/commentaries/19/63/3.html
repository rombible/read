The following lines convey in a modern dress the feeling of this part of the psalm:—<p>“So gazing up in my youth at love,<p>As seen through power, ever above<p>All modes which make it manifest,<p>My soul brought all to a single test—<p>That He, the Eternal, First and Last,<p>Who in His power had so surpassed<p>All man conceives of what is might,<p>Whose wisdom too showed infinite—<p>Would prove as infinitely good.”<p>R.

Mark well this declaration of the psalmist, reader. God’s loving-kindness is in itself, and in the account of all the saints, better than life, and all the comforts of life; life in its best estate; long life and prosperity. It is our spiritual and eternal life, and that is better than our natural and temporal life. It is better, a thousand times, to die in God’s favour, than to live under his wrath, under which we should of course be if we were deprived of his loving-kindness. <span class="ital">My lips shall praise thee — </span>Both for my former tastes and experiences of this truth, which I have just expressed, and for the assurance I have of being restored to the same blessed enjoyments which I have formerly had. Observe again, reader, those that have their hearts refreshed with the tokens of God’s favour, ought to have them enlarged in his praises. Great reason indeed have such to bless God, for they have better provisions and better possessions than the wealth of this world could afford them; and in the service of God, and in communion with him, have better employments and better enjoyments than they could have in the business and converse of this life.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/63.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>63:3-6 Even in affliction we need not want matter for praise. When this is the regular frame of a believer's mind, he values the loving-kindness of God more than life. God's loving-kindness is our spiritual life, and that is better than temporal life. We must praise God with joyful lips; we must address ourselves to the duties of religion with cheerfulness, and speak forth the praises of God from a principle of holy joy. Praising lips must be joyful lips. David was in continual danger; care and fear held his eyes waking, and gave him wearisome nights; but he comforted himself with thoughts of God. The mercies of God, when called to mind in the night watches, support the soul, making darkness cheerful. How happy will be that last morning, when the believer, awaking up after the Divine likeness, shall be satisfied with all the fulness of God, and praise him with joyful lips, where there is no night, and where sorrow and sighing flee away!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/63.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because thy loving-kindness is better than life - Thy favor; thy mercy.

See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-4.htm">Job 2:4</a>. But, above this, David valued the favor and friendship of God. If one or the other was to be sacrificed, he preferred that it should be his life; he would be willing to exchange that for the favor of God. Life was not desirable, life furnished no comforts - no joys - without the divine favor.<p>"My life itself, without Thy love,<p>No taste of pleasure could afford;<p>'Twould but a tiresome burden prove,<p>If I were banished from the Lord."<p>My lips shall praise thee - That is either<p>(a) because of this loving-kindness; because I have this trust in thy character; or<p>(b) because thou wilt restore me to the place of public worship, and I shall be permitted again to praise thee.<p>Probably the latter is the true idea. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/63.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

For life without the love of God is nothing else than death: a man that has no share in the love of God is dead while he lives; all the enjoyments of life, health, riches, honour, friends, &amp;c. are nothing without the love of God; the meanest temporal blessings with it are preferable to the greatest without it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-17.htm">Proverbs 15:17</a>; it lasts longer than life, and therefore must be better than that; death cannot separate from it; it continues to all eternity. And that the saints prefer it to this natural life appears by their readiness to lay it down for the sake of Christ and his Gospel, in which the lovingkindness of God is so richly manifested unto them; to which may be added, that it is the love of God which gives to his people spiritual life, and which issues in eternal life, and therefore must be better than a temporal one. The Targum is, <p>"for better is thy kindness, which thou wilt do for the righteous in the world to come, than the life which thou givest the wicked in this world;'' <p>my lips shall praise thee; that is, for thy lovingkindness, and because it is better than life, and any enjoyment of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/63.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/63.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">Because thy lovingkindness</span> &c.] R.V. renders, <span class="ital">For thy lovingkindness</span> &c., a further reason for the longing of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm" title="O God, you are my God; early will I seek you: my soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;">Psalm 63:1</a></span>. But it is best to retain the rendering of the A.V. He has waited to see God’s power and glory, yet after all it is the lovingkindness of which he has personal experience that tunes his lips to praise. When Moses desired to see God’s <span class="ital">glory</span>, he was granted a revelation of His <span class="ital">goodness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a> ff). It is <span class="ital">better than life</span>, than that which men count most precious, for without it life would be a desert. His life was threatened, but the danger fades out of sight in the consciousness of God’s love. Note the connexion of God’s strength and lovingkindness (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/63-2.htm" title="To see your power and your glory, so as I have seen you in the sanctuary....">Psalm 63:2-3</a></span>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/62-11.htm" title="God has spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongs to God....">Psalm 62:11-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall praise thee</span>] Shall laud thee, a different word from that in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm" title="My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise you with joyful lips:">Psalm 63:5</a></span>. The word is supposed to be a proof of the late date of the Psalm, as it is an Aramaic word, and is found elsewhere only in the later parts of the O.T. But it is precarious to argue from a single word, when the remains of Heb. literature are so comparatively scanty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">3–5</span>.

This is the internal connection of the third group with the two preceding ones. By means of the strophe vv. 10-13, our Psalm is brought into the closest reciprocal relationship with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1-13</a>. Concerning &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>. The accentuation divides <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a> quite correctly. The Athnach does not mark &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; as an independent clause: they are upon the balance &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, for a going up; they must rise, so light are they (Hengstenberg). Certainly this expression of the periphrastic future is possible (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-6</a> :17), still we feel the want here of the subject, which cannot be dispensed within the clause as an independent one. Since, however, the combining of the words with what follows is forbidden by the fact that the infinitive with &#1500; in the sense of the ablat. gerund. always comes after the principal clause, not before it (Ew. 280, d), we interpret: upon the balances ad ascendendum  equals  certo ascensuri, and in fact so that this is an attributive that is co-ordinate with &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;. Is the clause following now meant to affirm that men, one and all, belong to nothingness or vanity (&#1502;&#1503; partitivum), or that they are less than nothing (&#1502;&#1503; comparat.)? Umbreit, Stier, and others explain <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a> also in the latter way; but parallels like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-24.htm">Isaiah 41:24</a> do not favour this rendering, and such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-11.htm">Isaiah 44:11</a> are opposed to it. So also here the meaning is not that men stand under the category of that which is worthless or vain, but that they belong to the domain of the worthless or vain.<p>The warning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a> does not refer to the Absalomites, but, pointing to these as furnishing a salutary example, to those who, at the sight of the prosperous condition and joyous life on that side, might perhaps be seized with envy and covetousness. Beside &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; the meaning of &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; is nevertheless not: to set in vain hope upon anything (for the idea of hoping does not exist in this verb in itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-12.htm">Job 27:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>, nor in this construction of the verb), but: to be befooled, blinded by something vain (Hitzig). Just as they are not to suffer their heart to be befooled by their own unjust acquisition, so also are they not, when the property of others increases (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, root &#1504;&#1489;, to raise one's self, to mount up; cf. Arabic nabata, to sprout up, grow; nabara, to raise; intransitive, to increase, and many other verbal stems), to turn their heart towards it, as though it were something great and fortunate, that merited special attention and commanded respect. Two great truths are divinely attested to the poet. It is not to be rendered: once hath God spoken, now twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-5.htm">Job 40:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-10.htm">2 Kings 6:10</a>) have I heard this; but after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> : One thing hath God spoken, two things (it is) that I have heard; or in accordance with the interpunction, which here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>), is not to be called in question: these two things have I heard. Two divine utterances actually do follow. The two great truths are: (1) that God has the power over everything earthly, that consequently nothing takes place without Him, and that whatever is opposed to Him must sooner or later succumb; (2) that of this very God, the sovereign Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;), is mercy also, the energy of which is measured by His omnipotence, and which does not suffer him to succumb upon whom it is bestowed. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; the poet establishes these two revealed maxims which God has impressed upon his mind, from His righteous government as displayed in the history of men. He recompenses each one in accordance with his doing, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, as Paul confesses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>) no less than David, and even (vid., lxx) in the words of David. It shall be recompensed unto every man according to his conduct, which is the issue of his relationship to God. He who rises in opposition to the will and order of God, shall feel God's power (&#1506;&#1494;) as a power for punishment that dashes in pieces; and he who, anxious for salvation, resigns his own will to the will of God, receives from God's mercy or loving-kindness (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;), as from an overflowing fulness, the promised reward of faithfulness: his resignation becomes experience, and his hoping attainment. </body></html>
