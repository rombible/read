When this is the regular frame of a believer's mind, he values the loving-kindness of God more than life. God's loving-kindness is our spiritual life, and that is better than temporal life. We must praise God with joyful lips; we must address ourselves to the duties of religion with cheerfulness, and speak forth the praises of God from a principle of holy joy. Praising lips must be joyful lips. David was in continual danger; care and fear held his eyes waking, and gave him wearisome nights; but he comforted himself with thoughts of God. The mercies of God, when called to mind in the night watches, support the soul, making darkness cheerful. How happy will be that last morning, when the believer, awaking up after the Divine likeness, shall be satisfied with all the fulness of God, and praise him with joyful lips, where there is no night, and where sorrow and sighing flee away!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/63.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I remember thee upon my bed - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>. That is, when I lie down at night; when I compose myself to sleep. Nothing can be more proper than that our last thoughts, as we sink into quiet slumber, should be of God; of his being, his character, his mercy, his loving-kindness; of the dealings of his providence, and the manifestations of his grace toward us, during the day; and nothing is better suited to compose the mind to rest, and to induce quiet and gentle slumber, than the calmness of soul which arises from the idea of an Infinite God, and from confidence in him. Often when restless on our beds - when nothing else will lull the body to rest, the thought of God - the contemplation of his greatness, his mercy, and his love - the sweet sense of an assurance of his favor will soothe us, and cause us to sink into gentle repose. So it may be - so it will be - when we are about to sleep the long sleep of death, for then the most appropriate thoughts - the thoughts that will best prepare us for that long sleep - will be thoughts of God.<p>And meditate on thee in the night-watches - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>. The word watches here refers to the ancient divisions of the night for municipal or military purposes - periods of the night assigned to different persons to keep watch around a camp or city. The most common division of the night was into three parts, though the arrangement varied at different times.

The sense is, that when he was on his bed in the night season, when alone, and free from worldly cares and fatigues, and called to mind the love of God to him, the past experience of his kindness, his promises to hits, and the fulfilment of them: that he should then be delightfully entertained, abundantly satisfied, slid his mouth be filled with songs of praise; <p>and meditate on thee in the night watches; which the Jewish writers on the text say were three, as they were with the Jews, but with the Romans four; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>; and the night, in the times of Homer (r), was divided into three parts: the night season is a very proper one for meditation on the perfections, providences, promises, word and works of God; and which is very delightful and profitable, when attended with the presence, Spirit, and grace of God.

This is the internal connection of the third group with the two preceding ones. By means of the strophe vv. 10-13, our Psalm is brought into the closest reciprocal relationship with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1-13</a>. Concerning &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>. The accentuation divides <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a> quite correctly. The Athnach does not mark &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; as an independent clause: they are upon the balance &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, for a going up; they must rise, so light are they (Hengstenberg). Certainly this expression of the periphrastic future is possible (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-6</a> :17), still we feel the want here of the subject, which cannot be dispensed within the clause as an independent one. Since, however, the combining of the words with what follows is forbidden by the fact that the infinitive with &#1500; in the sense of the ablat. gerund. always comes after the principal clause, not before it (Ew. 280, d), we interpret: upon the balances ad ascendendum  equals  certo ascensuri, and in fact so that this is an attributive that is co-ordinate with &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;. Is the clause following now meant to affirm that men, one and all, belong to nothingness or vanity (&#1502;&#1503; partitivum), or that they are less than nothing (&#1502;&#1503; comparat.)? Umbreit, Stier, and others explain <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a> also in the latter way; but parallels like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-24.htm">Isaiah 41:24</a> do not favour this rendering, and such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-11.htm">Isaiah 44:11</a> are opposed to it. So also here the meaning is not that men stand under the category of that which is worthless or vain, but that they belong to the domain of the worthless or vain.<p>The warning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a> does not refer to the Absalomites, but, pointing to these as furnishing a salutary example, to those who, at the sight of the prosperous condition and joyous life on that side, might perhaps be seized with envy and covetousness. Beside &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; the meaning of &#1492;&#1489;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; is nevertheless not: to set in vain hope upon anything (for the idea of hoping does not exist in this verb in itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-12.htm">Job 27:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>, nor in this construction of the verb), but: to be befooled, blinded by something vain (Hitzig). Just as they are not to suffer their heart to be befooled by their own unjust acquisition, so also are they not, when the property of others increases (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, root &#1504;&#1489;, to raise one's self, to mount up; cf. Arabic nabata, to sprout up, grow; nabara, to raise; intransitive, to increase, and many other verbal stems), to turn their heart towards it, as though it were something great and fortunate, that merited special attention and commanded respect. Two great truths are divinely attested to the poet. It is not to be rendered: once hath God spoken, now twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-5.htm">Job 40:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-10.htm">2 Kings 6:10</a>) have I heard this; but after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> : One thing hath God spoken, two things (it is) that I have heard; or in accordance with the interpunction, which here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a> (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>), is not to be called in question: these two things have I heard. Two divine utterances actually do follow. The two great truths are: (1) that God has the power over everything earthly, that consequently nothing takes place without Him, and that whatever is opposed to Him must sooner or later succumb; (2) that of this very God, the sovereign Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;), is mercy also, the energy of which is measured by His omnipotence, and which does not suffer him to succumb upon whom it is bestowed. With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; the poet establishes these two revealed maxims which God has impressed upon his mind, from His righteous government as displayed in the history of men. He recompenses each one in accordance with his doing, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, as Paul confesses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>) no less than David, and even (vid., lxx) in the words of David. It shall be recompensed unto every man according to his conduct, which is the issue of his relationship to God. He who rises in opposition to the will and order of God, shall feel God's power (&#1506;&#1494;) as a power for punishment that dashes in pieces; and he who, anxious for salvation, resigns his own will to the will of God, receives from God's mercy or loving-kindness (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;), as from an overflowing fulness, the promised reward of faithfulness: his resignation becomes experience, and his hoping attainment. </body></html>
