This authorship has become a burning question which is only too apt to shut out far more important things. Whoever poured out this sweet meditation in the psalm before us, his tender longings for, and his jubilant possession of, God remain the same. It is either the work of a king in exile, or is written by some one who tries to cast himself into the mental attitude of such a person, and to reproduce his longing and his trust. It may be a question of literary interest, but it is of no sort of spiritual or religious importance whether the author is David or a singer of later date endeavouring to reproduce his emotions under certain circumstances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The three clauses which I have read, and which are so strikingly identical in form, constitute the three pivots on which the psalm revolves, the three bends in the stream of its thought and emotion. ‘My soul thirsts; my soul is satisfied; my soul follows hard after Thee.’ The three phases of emotion follow one another so swiftly that they are all wrapped up in the brief compass of this little song. Unless they in some degree express our experiences and emotions, there is little likelihood that our lives will be blessed or noble, and we have little right to call ourselves Christians. Let us follow the windings of the stream, and ask ourselves if we can see our own faces in its shining surface.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The soul that knows its own needs will thirst after God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Psalmist draws the picture of himself as a thirsty man in a waterless land. That may be a literally true reproduction of his condition, if indeed the old idea is correct, that this is a work of David’s; for there is no more appalling desert than that in which he wandered as an exile. It is a land of arid mountains without a blade of verdure, blazing in their ghastly whiteness under the fierce sunshine, and with gaunt ravines in which there are no pools or streams, and therefore no sweet sound of running waters, no shadow, no songs of birds, but all is hot, dusty, glaring, pitiless; and men and beasts faint, and loll out their tongues, and die for want of water. And, says the Psalmist, such is life, if due regard be had to the deepest wants of a soul, notwithstanding all the abundant supplies which are spread in such rich and loving luxuriance around us-we are thirsty men in a waterless land. I need not remind you how true it is that a man is but a bundle of appetites, desires, often tyrannous, often painful, always active. But the misery of it is-the reason why man’s misery is great upon him is-mainly, I suppose, that he does not know what it is that he wants; that he thirsts, but does not understand what the thirst means, nor what it is that will slake it. His animal appetites make no mistakes; he and the beasts know that when they are thirsty they have to drink, and when they are hungry they have to eat, and when they are drowsy they have to sleep. But the poor instinct of the animal that teaches it what to choose and what to avoid fails us in the higher reaches; and we are conscious of a craving, and do not find that the craving reveals to us the source from whence its satisfaction can be derived. Therefore ‘broken cisterns that can hold no water’ are at a premium, and ‘the fountain of living waters’ is turned away from, though it could slake so many thirsts. Like ignorant explorers in an enemy’s country, we see a stream, and we do not stop to ask whether there is poison in it or not before we glue our thirsty lips to it. There is a great old promise in one of the prophets which puts this notion of the misinterpretation of our thirsts, and the mistakes as to the sources from which they can be slaked, into one beautiful metaphor which is obscured in our English version. The prophet Isaiah says, according to our reading, ‘the parched land shall become a pool.’ The word which he uses is that almost technical one which describes the phenomenon known only in Eastern lands, or at least known in them only in its superlative degree; the mirage, where the dancing currents of ascending air simulate the likeness of a cool lake, with palm-trees around it. And, says he, ‘the mirage shall become a pool,’ the romance shall turn into a reality, the mistakes shall be rectified, and men shall know what it is that they want, and shall get it when they know. Brethren! unless we have listened to the teaching from above, unless we have consulted far more wisely and far more profoundly than many of us have ever done the meaning of our own hearts when they cry out, we too shall only be able to take for ours the plaintive cry of the half of this first utterance of the Psalmist, and say despairingly, ‘My soul thirsteth.’ Blessed are they who know where the fountain is, who know the meaning of the highest unrests in their own souls, and can go on to say with clear and true self-revelation, ‘My soul thirsteth for God!’ That is religion. There is a great deal more in Christianity than longing, but there is no Christianity worth the name without it. There is moral stimulus to activity, a pattern for conduct, and so on, in our religion, and if our religion is only this longing-well then, it is worth very little; and I fancy it is worth a good deal less if there is none of this felt need for God, and for more of God, in us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And so I come to two classes of my hearers; and to the first of them I say, Dear friends! do not mistake what it is that you ‘need,’ and see to it that you turn the current of your longings from earth to God; and to the second of them I say, Dear friends! if you have found out that God is your supreme good, see to it that you live in the good, see to it that you live in the constant attitude of longing for more of that good which alone will slake your appetite.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘The thirst that from the soul doth rise Doth ask a drink divine,’ and unless we know what it is to be drawn outwards and upwards, in strong aspirations after something-’afar from the sphere of our sorrow,’ I know not why we should call ourselves Christians at all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But, dear friends! let us not forget that these higher aspirations after the uncreated and personal good which is God have to be cultivated very sedulously and with great persistence, throughout all our changing lives, or they will soon die out, and leave us. There has to be the clear recognition, habitual to us, of what is our good. There has to be a continual meditation, if I may so say, upon the all-sufficiency of that divine Lord and Lover of our souls, and there has to be a vigilant and a continual suppression, and often excision and ejection, of other desires after transient and partial satisfactions. A man who lets all his longings go unchecked and untamed after earthly good has none left towards heaven. If you break up a river into a multitude of channels, and lead off much of it to irrigate many little gardens, there will be no force in its current, its bed will become dry, and it will never reach the great ocean where it loses its individuality and becomes part of a mightier whole. So, if we fritter away and divide up our desires among all the clamant and partial blessings of earth, then we shall but feebly long, and feebly longing, shall but faintly enjoy, the cool, clear, exhaustless gush from the fountain of life-’My soul thirsteth for God!’-in the measure in which that is true of us, and not one hairsbreadth beyond it, in spite of orthodoxy, and professions, and activities, are we Christian people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The soul that thirsts after God is satisfied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Psalmist, by the magic might of his desire, changes, as in a sudden transformation scene in a theatre, all the dreariness about him. One moment it is a ‘dry and barren land where no water is’; the next moment a flash of verdure has come over the yellow sand, and the ghastly silence is broken by the song of merry birds. The one moment he is hungering there in the desert; the next, he sees spread before him a table in the wilderness, and his soul is ‘satisfied as with marrow and with fatness,’ and his mouth praises God, whom he possesses, who has come unto him swift, immediate, in full response to his cry. Now, all that is but a picturesque way of putting a very plain truth, which we should all be the happier and better if we believed and lived by, that we can have as much of God as we desire, and that what we have of Him will be enough.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We can have as much of God as we desire. There is a quest which finds its object with absolute certainty, and which finds its object simultaneously with the quest. And these two things, the certainty and the immediateness with which the thirst of the soul after God passes into a satisfied fruition of the soul in God, are what are taught us here in our text; and what you and I, if we comply with the conditions, may have as our own blessed experience. There is one search about which it is true that it never fails to find. The certainty that the soul thirsting after God shall be satisfied with God results at once from His nearness to us, and His infinite willingness to give Himself, which He is only prevented from carrying into act by our obstinate refusal to open our hearts by desire. It takes all a man’s indifference to keep God out of his heart, ‘for in Him we live, and move, and have our being,’ and that divine love, which Christianity teaches us to see on the throne of the universe, is but infinite longing for self-communication. That is the definition of true love always, and they fearfully mistake its essence, and take the lower and spurious forms of it for the higher and nobler, who think of love as being what, alas! it often is, in our imperfect lives, a fierce desire to have for our very own the thing or person beloved. But that is a second-rate kind of love. God’s love is an infinite desire to give Himself. If only we open our hearts-and nothing opens them so wide as longing-He will pour in, as surely as the atmosphere streams in through every chink and cranny, as surely as if some great black rock that stands on the margin of the sea is blasted away, the waters will flood over the sands behind it. So unless we keep God out, by not wishing Him in, in He will come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The certitude that we possess Him when we desire Him is as absolute. As swift as Marconi’s wireless message across the Atlantic and its answer; so immediate is the response from Heaven to the desire from earth. What a contrast that is to all our experiences! Is there anything else about which we can say ‘I am quite sure that if I want it I shall have it. I am quite sure that when I want it I have it’? Nothing! There may be wells to which a man has to go, as the Bedouin in the desert has to go, with empty water-skins, many a day’s journey, and it comes to be a fight between the physical endurance of the man and the weary distance between him and the spring. Many a man’s bones, and many a camel’s, lie on the track to the wells, who lay down gasping and black-lipped, and died before they reached them. We all know what it is to have longing desires which have cost us many an effort, and efforts and desires have both been in vain. Is it not blessed to be sure that there is One whom to long for is immediately to possess?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then there is the other thought here, too, that when we have God we have enough. That is not true about anything else. God forbid that one should depreciate the wise adaptation of earthly goods to human needs which runs all through every life! but all that recognised, still we come back to this, that there is nothing here, nothing except God Himself, that will fill all the corners of a human heart. There is always something lacking in all other satisfactions. They address themselves to sides, and angles, and facets of our complex nature; they leave all the others unsatisfied. The table that is spread in the world, at which, if I might use so violent a figure, our various longings and capacities seat themselves as guests, always fails to provide for some of them, and whilst some, and those especially of the lower type, are feasting full, there sits by their side another guest, who finds nothing on the table to satisfy his hunger. But if my soul thirsts for God, my soul will be satisfied when I get Him. The prophet Isaiah modifies this figure in the great word of invitation which pealed out from him, where he says, ‘Ho! everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.’ But that figure is not enough for him, that metaphor, blessed as it is, does not exhaust the facts; and so he goes on, ‘yea, come, buy wine’-and that is not enough for him, that does not exhaust the facts, therefore he adds, ‘and milk.’ Water, wine, and milk; all forms of the draughts that slake the thirsts of humanity, are found in God Himself, and he who has Him needs seek nowhere besides.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lastly-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The soul that is satisfied with God immediately renews its quest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘My soul followeth hard after Thee.’ The two things come together, longing and fruition, as I have said. Fruition begets longing, and there is swift and blessed alternation, or rather co-existence of the two. Joyful consciousness of possession and eager anticipation of larger bestowments are blended still more closely, if we adhere to the original meaning of the words of this last clause, than they are in our translation, for the psalm really reads, ‘My soul cleaveth after Thee.’ In the one word ‘cleaveth,’ is expressed adhesion, like that of the limpet to the rock, conscious union, blessed possession; and in the other word ‘after Thee’ is expressed the pressing onwards for more and yet more. But now contrast that with the issue of all other methods of satisfying human appetites, be they lower or be they higher. They result either in satiety or in a tyrannical, diseased appetite which increases faster than the power of satisfying it increases. The man who follows after other good than God, has at the end to say, ‘I am sick, tired of it, and it has lost all power to draw me,’ or he has to say, ‘I ravenously long for more of it, and I cannot get any more.’ ‘He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase.’ You have to increase the dose of the narcotic, and as you increase the dose, it loses its power, and the less you can do without it the less it does for you. But to drink into the one God slakes all thirsts, and because He is infinite, and our capacity for receiving Him may be indefinitely expanded; therefore, ‘Age cannot wither, nor custom stale His infinite variety’; but the more we have of God, the more we long for Him, and the more we long for Him the more we possess Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Brethren! these are the possibilities of the Christian life; being its possibilities they are our obligations. The Psalmist’s words may well be turned by us into self-examining interrogations and we may-God grant that we do!-all ask ourselves; ‘Do I thus thirst after God?’ ‘Have I learned that, notwithstanding all supplies, this world without Him is a waterless desert? Have I experienced that whilst I call He answers, and that the water flows in as soon as I open my heart? And do I know the happy birth of fresh longings out of every fruition, and how to go further and further into the blessed land, and into my elastic heart receive more and more of the ever blessed God?’ These texts of mine not only set forth the ideal for the Christian life here, but they carry in themselves the foreshadowing of the life hereafter. For surely such a merely physical accident as death cannot be supposed to break this golden sequence which runs through life. Surely this partial and progressive possession of an infinite good, by a nature capable of indefinitely increasing appropriation of, and approximation to it is the prophecy of its own eternal continuance. So long as the fountain springs, the thirsty lips will drink. God’s servants will live till God dies. The Christian life will go on, here and hereafter, till it has reached the limits of its own capacity of expansion, and has exhausted God. ‘The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/63.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-8.htm" title="My soul follows hard after you: your right hand upholds me.">Psalm 63:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">My soul followeth hard after thee — </span>Pursues communion with thee, and a conformity to thee, with earnest, increasing, and restless desire, lively expectation, and unwearied diligence: follows thee resolvedly, and, as it were, step by step, when thou seemest to depart, and withdraw thyself from me, as the Hebrew phrase here used implies.

Let us always remember we should fail and be weary of following the Lord, and certainly should not follow him fully, if his right hand did not uphold us.

Having committed ourselves to God, we must be easy and pleased, and quiet from the fear of evil. Those that follow hard after God, would soon fail, if God's right hand did not uphold them. It is he that strengthens us and comforts us. The psalmist doubts not but that though now sowing in tears, he should reap in joy. Messiah the Prince shall rejoice in God; he is already entered into the joy set before him, and his glory will be completed at his second coming. Blessed Lord, let our desire towards thee increase every hour; let our love be always upon thee; let all our enjoyment be in thee, and all our satisfaction from thee.

Then it means to attach oneself to anything; and then, to pursue or follow after. The idea here is that of adhering to, or cleaving to; and the meaning is, that the psalmist adhered firmly to God, as pieces of wood glued together adhere to each other; that he, as it were, stuck fast to him; that he would not leave him or be separated from him. The language represents the feelings of true piety in adhering firmly and constantly to God, whatever there may be that tends to separate us from him. The adhesion of bodies by glue is a striking but not an adequate representation of the firmness with which the soul adheres to God. Portions of matter held together by glue may be separated; the soul of the true believer never can be separated from God.<p>Thy right hand upholdeth me - The right hand is that by which we accomplish anything; and, by constant use, is stronger than the left hand.

Or, "my soul cleaveth after thee", or "to thee" (t); not to the world, and the things of it; not to that which is evil, but to that which is good, even the "summum bonum"; not to the creature, but to the Lord; which is expressive of union to him, even such an one as is between man and wife, who cleave to each other, and are one flesh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; and as is between head and members, vine and branches; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>; and of communion in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty.

In what a happy, comfortable, and safe condition must the psalmist be! his soul following hard after the Lord; and the Lord holding and sustaining him with his right hand! and how vain must be the attempts of his enemies against him! whose destruction is next predicted. <p>(t)  "adhaesit post te", Montanus, Gejerus; "tibi adhaesit", Tigurine version; so Piscator, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/63.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My soul <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</span><p>(e) He assures himself by the Spirit of God to have the gift of constancy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/63.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">followeth hard after thee</span>] Lit., <span class="ital">cleaves after thee;</span> cleaves to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you hold, and swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 10:20</a> &c.) and follows Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm" title="Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come to us as the rain, as the latter and former rain to the earth.">Hosea 6:3</a>). <span class="ital">Hard</span> = ‘close.’ Cp.

But &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; forbids this construction; and the assertion that otherwise it ought to be, "Jahve, my God art Thou" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-7.htm">Psalm 140:7</a>), rests upon a non-recognition of the Elohimic style. Elohim alone by itself is a vocative, and accordingly has Mehupach legarme. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; signifies earnest, importunate seeking and inquiring (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-34.htm">Psalm 78:34</a>), and in itself has nothing to do with &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;, the dawn; but since <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a> looks back upon the night, it appears to be chosen with reference to the dawning morning, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a> also, &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; stands by the side of &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;. The lxx is therefore not incorrect when it renders it: &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9; (cf. &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-38.htm">Luke 21:38</a>); and Apollinaris strikes the right note when he begins his paraphrase,<p>&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;<p>&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; - <p>At night when the morning dawns will I exult around Thee,<p>most blessed One.<p>The supposition that &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, or even that the Beth is Beth essentiae ("as a," etc.), are views that have no ground whatever, except as setting the inscription at defiance. What is meant is the parched thirsty desert of sand in which David finds himself. We do not render it: in a dry and languishing land, for &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is not an adjective, but a substantive - the transition of the feminine adjective to the masculine primary form, which sometimes (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>) occurs, therefore has no application here; nor: in the land of drought and of weariness, for who would express himself thus? &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1507;, referring to the nearest subject &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, continues the description of the condition (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>). In a region where he is surrounded by sun-burnt aridity and a nature that bears only one uniform ash-coloured tint, which casts its unrefreshing image into his inward part, which is itself in much the same parched condition, his soul thirsts, his flesh languishes, wearied and in want of water (languidus deficiente aqua), for God, the living One and the Fountain of life. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468; (here with the tone drawn back, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-10.htm">1 Chronicles 28:10</a>, &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a>) of ardent longing which consumes the last energies of a man (root &#1499;&#1501;, whence &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1505; to conceal, and therefore like &#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1507;, proceeding from the idea of enveloping; Arabic Arab. kamiha, to be blind, dark, pale, and disconcerted). The lxx and Theodotion erroneously read &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (how frequently is this the case!); whereas Aquila renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, and Symmachus still better, &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (the word used of the longing of love). It is not a small matter that David is able to predicate such languishing desire after God even of his felsh; it shows us that the spirit has the mastery within him, and not only forcibly keeps the flesh in subjection, but also, so far as possible, draws it into the realm of its own life - an experience confessedly more easily attained in trouble, which mortifies our carnal nature, than in the midst of the abundance of outward prosperity. The God for whom he is sick [lit. love-sick] in soul and body is the God manifest upon Zion.<p>Now as to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a> - a particle which is just such a characteristic feature in the physiognomy of this Psalm as &#1488;&#1498; is in that of the preceding Psalm - there are two notional definitions to choose from: thus  equals  so, as my God (Ewald), and: with such longing desire (as e.g., Oettinger). In the former case it refers back to the confession, "Elohim, my God art Thou," which stands at the head of the Psalm; in the latter, to the desire that has just been announced, and that not in its present exceptional character, but in its more general and constant character. This reference to what has immediately gone before, and to the modality, not of the object, but of the disposition of mind, deserves the preference. "Thus" is accordingly equivalent to "longing thus after Thee." The two &#1499;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a> are parallel and of like import. The alternation of the perfect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>) and of the future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>) implies that what has been the Psalmist's favourite occupation heretofore, shall also be so in the future. Moreover, &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1510;&#1497;&#1492; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; form a direct antithesis. Just as he does not in a dry land, so formerly in the sanctuary he looked forth longingly towards God (&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; with the conjoined idea of solemnity and devotion). We have now no need to take &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; as a gerundive (videndo), which is in itself improbable; for one looks, peers, gazes at anything just for the purpose of seeing what the nature of the object is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18</a>). The purpose of his gazing upon God as to gain an insight into the nature of God, so far as it is disclosed to the creature; or, as it is expressed here, to see His power and glory, i.e., His majesty on its terrible and on its light and loving side, to see this, viz., in its sacrificial appointments and sacramental self-attestations. Such longing after God, which is now all the more intense in the desert far removed from the sanctuary, filled and impelled him; for God's loving-kindness is better than life, better than this natural life (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a>), which is also a blessing, and as the prerequisite of all earthly blessings a very great blessing. The loving-kindness of God, however, is a higher good, is in fact the highest good and the true life: his lips shall praise this God of mercy, his morning song shall be of Him; for that which makes him truly happy, and after which he even now, as formerly, only and solely longs, is the mercy or loving-kindness (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;) of this God, the infinite wroth of which is measured by the greatness of His power (&#1506;&#1494;) and glory (&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;). It might also be rendered, "Because Thy loving-kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise Thee;" but if &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is taken as demonstrative (for), it yields a train of thought that that is brought about not merely by what follows (as in the case of the relative because), but also by what precedes: "for Thy loving-kindness...my lips shall then praise Thee" (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1498; with the suffix appended to the energetic plural form u&#770;n, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>). </body></html>
