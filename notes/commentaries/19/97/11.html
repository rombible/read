The metaphor must not be pressed so as to think of a harvest to come. The image is an obvious and common one.<p>“Sol etiam summo de vertice dissipat omnes<p>Ardorem in partes, et lumine consent arva.”<p>LUCRETIUS.<p>And Milton, while enriching its metaphor, doubless had the psalm in his mind:—<p>“Now morn, her rosy steps in the Eastern clime<p>Advancing, sow’d the earth with orient pearl.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/97.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/97-11.htm" title="Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart....">Psalm 97:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Light is sown for the righteous — </span>Joy and felicity, as the word <span class="ital">light </span>often signifies, are prepared or laid up for them, and shall in due time be reaped by them, possibly in this life, but undoubtedly in the next; and therefore the followers of Christ, who are taught to expect tribulation in this world, may well bear their afflictions with patience and cheerfulness, for, though they <span class="ital">sow in tears, </span>they shall, without fail, <span class="ital">reap in joy. Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous — </span>Let the streams of comfort which flow to you through the channel of Christ’s kingdom lead you to the fountain, and cause you to rejoice in God your Saviour; <span class="ital">and give thanks in remembrance</span> <span class="ital">of his holiness — </span>In consideration of his holy and righteous nature and government, or of his faithfulness in fulfilling his promises, in sending the Messiah into the world and establishing his kingdom among men. Observe, reader, whatever is the matter of our rejoicing ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving, and particularly the holiness of God. They that hate sin themselves are glad that God hates it, in hopes that therefore he will not suffer it to have dominion over them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/97.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>97:8-12 The faithful servants of God may well rejoice and be glad, because he is glorified; and whatever tends to his honour, is his people's pleasure. Care is taken for their safety. But something more is meant than their lives. The Lord will preserve the souls of his saints from sin, from apostacy, and despair, under their greatest trials. He will deliver them out of the hands of the wicked one, and preserve them safe to his heavenly kingdom. And those that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and in his exaltation, have fountains of joy prepared for them. Those that sow in tears, shall reap in joy. Gladness is sure to the upright in heart; the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment. Sinners tremble, but saints rejoice at God's holiness. As he hates sin, yet freely loves the person of the repentant sinner who believes in Christ, he will make a final separation between the person he loves and the sin he hates, and sanctify his people wholly, body, soul, and spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/97.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Light is sown for the righteous - That is, There is light for the righteous; or, they shall be brought into light, though they may be for a time in darkness. The word rendered "sown" - &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;  za&#770;ra&#8219; - is from a verb which properly denotes to scatter, to disperse - as seed is scattered or dispersed when sown in a field. It is hence used with reference to moral subjects, as to sow righteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>; to sow iniquity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>; to sow mischief, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; that is, these things are scattered or sown, as seed is in a field, and produce a corresponding harvest. Thus light is scattered abroad, and will produce an appropriate harvest - a harvest of joy. It will spring up around the righteous, and he shall reap that which light tends to produce - happiness, intelligence, and peace. The figure of sowing light is an unusual one, but the meaning is plain. It is, that the righteous will not always be in darkness; that there is in preparation for him a harvest of joy; that it will as certainly be produced as a harvest will from grain that is sown; that though there may be present calamities, there will be ultimate peace and triumph.<p>And gladness for the upright in heart - The word gladness here - joy, or rejoicing - is parallel to the word light. Joy or gladness is sown for the righteous; that is, arrangements are made for producing joy, as preparations are made by sowing seed for a harvest. The world is full of arrangements for conferring happiness on the righteous. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/97.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. sown&#8212;to spring forth abundantly for such, who alone can and well may rejoice in the holy government of their sovereign Lord (compare Ps 30:4; 32:11).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/97.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Light, </span> i.e. joy and felicity, as this word is used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-16.htm" title="The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor.">Esther 8:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm" title="To the upright there rises light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.">Psalm 112:4</a></span>, and oft elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is sown; </span> is prepared or laid up for them, and shall in due time be reaped by them, possibly in this life, but undoubtedly in the next.

Who are made righteous by the obedience of Christ, and live soberly and righteously; the light of joy and gladness, as it is explained in the next clause; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-16.htm">Esther 8:16</a> so,  "light", is frequently used by Homer (x) for joy and gladness: these sometimes are without it, through the hidings of God's face, the prevalence of corruptions, the force of Satan's temptations, and the many afflictions they meet with; but joy and gladness, peace and comfort, are sown for them in the counsels and purposes of God, in his covenant, in the Scriptures, in the Gospel, and in the promises of it; and, though at present hidden, will spring up in God's due time, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>, and which also may be interpreted of the light of glory, which at present does not appear; but it is prepared in the purpose of God, and in his promise, and shall be enjoyed by the heirs of it. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, render it, "light is risen for the righteous"; and so the Targum, <p>"light is risen and prepared for the righteous;'' <p>Christ, the light of the world, the sun of righteousness, is risen for them, and upon them, with healing in his wings, which bring joy and comfort to them: <p>and gladness for the upright in heart; such as have new hearts and right spirits formed in them, and are Israelites indeed, that have the truth of grace and the root of the matter in them: gladness is prepared, provided, and promised to them, and sooner or later they shall have it; the seed of it is sown, and it will spring up, and a large crop shall be enjoyed. Kimchi's note is, <p>"light is sown for the righteous in this world, and they shall reap light and joy in time to come, in the days of the Messiah.'' <p>(x) Iliad 6. v. 6. &amp; 8. v. 282. &amp; 16. v. 39. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/97.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{i}</span> Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</span><p>(i) Though God's deliverance does not appear suddenly, yet it is sown and laid up in store for them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/97.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Light is sown</span>] The idea is rather that of the diffusion of light at the dawn than of a seed sown to bear fruit hereafter. For the metaphor cp. Lucr. ii. 211, “Sol lumine <span class="ital">conserit</span> arva”; and Verg. <span class="ital">Aen</span>. iv. 584, “Et iam prima novo <span class="ital">spargebat</span> lumine terras … Aurora.” But most of the Ancient Versions represent the reading, Light hath arisen for the righteous, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm" title="To the upright there rises light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.">Psalm 112:4</a> (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-22.htm" title="The sun rises, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.">Psalm 104:22</a>), and this is probably right. So the P.B.V. <span class="ital">There is sprung up a light</span>, from the LXX through the Vulg. For <span class="ital">light</span> as a metaphor for happiness and prosperity cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm" title="The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm" title="For with you is the fountain of life: in your light shall we see light.">Psalm 36:9</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/97.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Light is sown for the righteous</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>, "Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness").
