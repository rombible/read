In the history of their destruction the world of the ungodly may view a striking picture of the great and terrible day when the Lord Jesus shall render a recompense to all his enemies.

And all have reason to rejoice in Christ's government. There is a depth in his counsels, which we must not pretend to fathom; but still righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. Christ's government, though it might be matter of joy to all, will yet be matter of terror to some; but it is their own fault that it is so. The most resolute and daring opposition will be baffled at the presence of the Lord. And the Lord Jesus will ere long come, and put an end to idol worship of every kind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/97.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A fire goeth before him - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3</a>, note.<p>And burneth up his enemies round about - Is especially directed against his foes.

Some apply this to the gifts of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, signified by cloven tongues of fire; but then no such effect followed as mentioned in the next clause: it seems best to interpret it of his wrath, which, like fire, was poured out to the uttermost on the Jews, for their disbelief and rejection of him; they would not have him to reign over them; they despised his Gospel, and slew his servants; wherefore he sent the Roman armies to them, who destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-7.htm">Matthew 22:7</a>, this will be also verified in the second coming of Christ, who will descend in flaming fire, and the earth will be burnt up, and all that is therein, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, some Jewish writers interpret this of the war of Gog and Magog, in Ezekiel, which they suppose still future; as, when it is, fire will be sent and rained upon them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>, but may be better applied to the Gog and Magog in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>. <p>and burneth up his enemies round about; so that none can escape: this was true of the Jewish nation, who were burnt up; so that there was not left root nor branch in it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, and will be true of the wicked, at the general conflagration of the world, upon Christ's second coming; and of the Gog and Magog army, after the resurrection. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/97.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/97.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fire goeth before him.</span> So long as there is evil in the world, the "fire" of God's wrath must necessarily "go before him" at each theophany, to sweep the evil from his path (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-25.htm">Isaiah 42:25</a>).

The world below, hitherto shaken by war and anarchy, now stands upon foundations that cannot be shaken in time to come, under Jahve's righteous and gentle sway. This is the joyful tidings of the new era which the poet predicts from out of his own times, when he depicts the joy that will then pervade the whole creation; in connection with which it is hardly intentional that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11</a> acrostically contain the divine names &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;.
