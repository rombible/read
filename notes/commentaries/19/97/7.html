The idea is, that they would be disappointed.

What is here affirmed of the worshippers of idols will be found to be true at last of all who put their trust in anything but the true God.<p>That boast themselves of idols - That worship idols, and glory in them as if they could save; or, that glory in their own idol-gods as if they were more powerful than those of other people.

The Septuagint and the Vulgate render this, "all his angels." The original word &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'Elohiym is that which is commonly applied to the true God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, et saepe), though it may be applied to angels, or to magistrates.

On the general meaning of this passage, and the question respecting its reference to the Messiah, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. The reference here, according to the quotation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>, is to the angels. The original word will admit of this interpretation, and the entire structure of the psalm will justify its application to the Messiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/97.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Paul quotes, not as a prophecy, but as language used in regard to the Lord Jehovah, who in the Old Testament theophania is the second person of the Godhead.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/97.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.<p>8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O Lord.<p>9 For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a><p>"Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols." They shall be so; shame shall cover their faces, they shall blush to think of their former besotted boastings. When a man gravely worships what has been engraved by a man's hand, and puts his trust in a mere nothing and nonentity, he is indeed brutish, and when he is converted from such absurdity he may well be ashamed. A man who worships an image is but the image of a man, his senses must have left him. He who boasts of an idol makes an idle boast. "Worship him, all ye gods." Bow down yourselves, ye fancied gods. Let Jove do homage to Jehovah, let Jove lay down his hammer at the foot of the cross, and Juggernaut remove his blood-stained car out of the road of Immanuel. If the false gods are thus bidden to worship the coming Lord, how much more shall they adore him who are godlike creatures in heaven, even the angelic spirits? Paul quotes this passage as the voice of God to angels when he sent his Son into the world. All powers are bound to recognise the chief power; since they derive their only rightful authority from the Lord, they should be careful to acknowledge his superiority at all times by the most reverent adoration.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-8.htm">Psalm 97:8</a><p>"Zion heard, and was glad." While the heathen are confounded the people of God are made to triumph, for they love to see their God exalted. The day shall come when the literal Zion, so long forsaken, shall joy in the common salvation. It did so at the first when the apostles dwelt at Jerusalem, and the good days will come back again. "And the daughters of Judah rejoiced." Each individual believer is glad when he sees false systems broken up and idol gods broken down; the judgments of the Lord afford unalloyed delight to those who worship the true God in spirit and in truth. In the first ages of Christianity the believing Israel rejoiced to see Christ's kingdom victorious among the heathen, and even yet, though for a while turning aside, the daughters of Judah will sympathise in the wide-spread reign of Jehovah their God, through the gospel of his dear Son. As the women of Judah went forth to meet David in the dance, singing his victory over the Philistine, so shall they chant the triumphs of David's son and Lord.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-9.htm">Psalm 97:9</a><p>"For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth." And therefore do we rejoice to see the idols abolished and to see all mankind bending at thy throne. There is but one God, there cannot be another, and he is and ever must be over all. "Thou art exalted far above all gods." As much as ALL is exalted above nothing, and perfection above folly. Jehovah is not alone high over Judea, but over all the earth, nor is he exalted over men only, but over everything that can be called god: the days are on their way when all men shall discern this truth, and shall render unto the Lord the glory which is due alone to him. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/97.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Confounded be all they; </span> let them be ashamed of their former folly herein, and be thereby brought to detest and forsake them; and those who will obstinately persist in their impiety and idolatry, let them be brought to confusion.
