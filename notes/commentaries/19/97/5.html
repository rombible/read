And all have reason to rejoice in Christ's government. There is a depth in his counsels, which we must not pretend to fathom; but still righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. Christ's government, though it might be matter of joy to all, will yet be matter of terror to some; but it is their own fault that it is so. The most resolute and daring opposition will be baffled at the presence of the Lord.

The most firm, solid, lofty things were as nothing in his presence. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-5.htm">Judges 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>. The object here is to describe the sublimity, the greatness, the majesty of God, as if nothing could stand before him; as if everything fled away when he approached. There is perhaps a general allusion to his glory and power as manifested at Sinai.<p>At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth - The Creator and Ruler of the entire world. The God who thus manifested himself is not a local Deity, or the God of a particular nation or country, but the God of the whole world, before whom all created things are as nothing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/97.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5.

Kimchi interprets the "hills" of the kings of the wicked; and it was verified in Herod and his nobles, and the citizens of Jerusalem, who, when they heard of the coming of the Messiah, of the birth of the King of the Jews, were exceedingly moved and troubled; their hearts melted like wax within them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>, so when he appeared, in the power of his Gospel, in the Gentile world, and went forth in the ministration of it, conquering, and to conquer, all fled before him; every mountain and island were moved out of their places; and the kings of the earth, and great men, ran to the rocks to hide them from his face, which they could not bear, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>, and the like events, and more terrible, will they be, when he comes to destroy antichrist, and especially to judge the world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>. <p>at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth; as Christ is; he is Lord of all, the Prince of the kings of the earth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>, and as he will show himself to be at the great day; and that is the reason why the proud and lofty, comparable to hills and mountains, shall melt at his presence. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/97.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/97.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.
