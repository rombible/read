And all have reason to rejoice in Christ's government. There is a depth in his counsels, which we must not pretend to fathom; but still righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. Christ's government, though it might be matter of joy to all, will yet be matter of terror to some; but it is their own fault that it is so. The most resolute and daring opposition will be baffled at the presence of the Lord.

The psalmist on his part follows the model of Isaiah, who makes the trees of the wood exult and clap their hands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>. The &#1488;&#1494;, which points into this festive time of all creatures which begins with Jahve's coming, is as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>. Instead of &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, "before," the chronicler has the &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; so familiar to him, by which the joy is denoted as being occasioned by Jahve's appearing. The lines <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a> sound very much like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>. The chronicler has abridged <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a>, by hurrying on to the mosaic-work portion taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a>. The poet at the close glances from the ideal past into the future. The twofold &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; is a participle, Ew. 200. Being come to judgment, after He has judged and sifted, executing punishment, Jahve will govern in the righteousness of mercy and in faithfulness to the promises. </body></html>
