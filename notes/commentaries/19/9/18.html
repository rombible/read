There is a day coming, when it will appear that he has not forgotten the cry of the humble; neither the cry of their blood, or the cry of their prayers. We are never brought so low, so near to death, but God can raise us up. If he has saved us from spiritual and eternal death, we may thence hope, that in all our distresses he will be a very present help to us. The overruling providence of God frequently so orders it, that persecutors and oppressors are brought to ruin by the projects they formed to destroy the people of God. Drunkards kill themselves; prodigals beggar themselves; the contentious bring mischief upon themselves: thus men's sins may be read in their punishment, and it becomes plain to all, that the destruction of sinners is of themselves. All wickedness came originally with the wicked one from hell; and those who continue in sin, must go to that place of torment. The true state, both of nations and of individuals, may be correctly estimated by this one rule, whether in their doings they remember or forget God. David encourages the people of God to wait for his salvation, though it should be long deferred. God will make it appear that he never did forget them: it is not possible he should. Strange that man, dust in his and about him, should yet need some sharp affliction, some severe visitation from God, to bring him to the knowledge of himself, and make him feel who and what he is.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the needy - The poor; those who are dependent and helpless.<p>Shall not always be forgotten - That is, by God.

The people of God are poor and needy for the most part; they are so in things temporal, and they are poor in spirit, or in things spiritual, of which they are sensible; their needs are many, and frequently return; but God has provided a throne of grace for them to come to for help in time of need, and he will supply all their wants out of the fulness of grace in Christ; nor is he unmindful of them, and of his covenant with them; strictly speaking, they are never forgotten by him, being engraven on his hands, and set as a seal on his heart; but they sometimes seem to be so both to themselves and others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>; and they may continue so long; God may seem for a long time to take no notice of them, but suffer them to lie under affliction and persecution; the holy city is trodden under foot forty two months, or one thousand two hundred and sixty days, that is, so many years; so long the witnesses prophesy in sackcloth, so long the church is in the wilderness, and so long will be the reign of antichrist, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>; but as great Babylon will come up in remembrance before God, and he will remember her sins, and render her double; the set time to favour his poor and needy will come, and he will arise and have mercy on them, and bring them into a glorious and comfortable state and condition; <p>the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever; the negative particle, though not in the original text, is rightly supplied from the preceding clause, as it is by the Targum, Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and Kimchi, and as the sense requires; and the expectation of Christ's poor ones is not only a supply of grace here and eternal happiness hereafter; but they expect a glorious state of the church on earth, and that Christ will descend in person from heaven, and his tabernacle will be among men; and that they shall be kings and priests, and possess the kingdom, and reign with Christ a thousand years; and though these things may seem to be deferred, and their expectation put off to a length of time, yet it shall not perish for ever; there will be a performance of the things promised and expected. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> of the poor shall <i>not</i> perish for ever.</span><p>(i) God does not promise to help us before we have felt the cross.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>.

The summons contains a moral claim, and therefore applies to all, and to each one individually. Jahve, who is to be praised everywhere and by every one, is called &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, which does not mean: He who sits enthroned in Zion, but He who inhabiteth Zion, Ges. 138, 1. Such is the name by which He is called since the time when His earthly throne, the ark, was fixed on the castle hill of Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-3.htm">Psalm 76:3</a>. It is the epithet applied to Him during the period of the typical kingship of promise. That Jahve's salvation shall be proclaimed from Zion to all the world, even outside Israel, for their salvation, is, as we see here and elsewhere, an idea which throbs with life even in the Davidic Psalms; later prophecy beholds its realisation in its wider connections with the history of the future. That which shall be proclaimed to the nations is called &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, a designation which the magnalia Dei have obtained in the Psalms and the prophets since the time of Hannah's song, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a> (from &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;, root &#1506;&#1500;, to come over or upon anything, to influence a person or a thing, as it were, from above, to subject them to one's energy, to act upon them).<p>With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quod, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>, the subject of the proclamation of salvation is unfolded as to its substance. The praett. state that which is really past; for that which God has done is the assumption that forms the basis of the discourse in praise of God on account of His mighty acts. They consist in avenging and rescuing His persecuted church-persecuted even to martyrdom. The &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, standing by way of emphasis before its verb, refers to those who are mentioned afterwards (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a>): the Chethb calls them &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the Keri &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;. Both words alternate elsewhere also, the Ker at one time placing the latter, at another the former, in the place of the one that stands in the text. They are both referable to &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; to bend (to bring low, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5</a>). The neuter signification of the verb &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;  equals  &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;, Arab.. &#8219;na&#770;, fut o., underlies the noun &#1506;&#1504;&#1493; (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;), for which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a> there is a Ker &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; with an incorrect Jod (like &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23</a>). This is manifest from the substantive &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, which does not signify affliction, but passiveness, i.e., humility and gentleness; and the noun &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; is passive, and therefore does not, like &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;, signify one who is lowly-minded, in a state of &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, but one who is bowed down by afflictions, &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;. But because the twin virtues denoted by &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; are acquired in the school of affliction, there comes to be connected with &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; - but only secondarily - the notion of that moral and spiritual condition which is aimed at by dispensations of affliction, and is joined with a suffering life, rather than with one of worldly happiness and prosperity, - a condition which, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a> shows, is properly described by &#1506;&#1504;&#1493; (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c2;). It shall be proclaimed beyond Israel, even among the nations, that the Avenger of blood, &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, thinks of them (His &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;), and has been as earnest in His concern for them as they in theirs for Him. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; always signifies human blood that is shed by violence and unnaturally; the plur. is the plural of the product discussed by Dietrich, Abhandl. S. 40. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; to demand back from any one that which he has destroyed, and therefore to demand a reckoning, indemnification, satisfaction for it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>, then absolutely to punish, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">2 Chronicles 24:22</a>. </body></html>
