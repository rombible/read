When we give thanks for some one particular mercy, we should remember former mercies. Our joy must not be in the gift, so much as in the Giver. The triumphs of the Redeemer ought to be the triumphs of the redeemed. The almighty power of God is that which the strongest and stoutest of his enemies are no way able to stand before. We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, and that with him there is no unrighteousness. His people may, by faith, flee to him as their Refuge, and may depend on his power and promise for their safety, so that no real hurt shall be done to them. Those who know him to be a God of truth and faithfulness, will rejoice in his word of promise, and rest upon that. Those who know him to be an everlasting Father, will trust him with their souls as their main care, and trust in him at all times, even to the end; and by constant care seek to approve themselves to him in the whole course of their lives. Who is there that would not seek him, who never hath forsaken those that seek Him?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When mine enemies are turned back - Who these enemies were, the psalmist does not say. It is clear, however, as was remarked in the introduction, that the psalm was composed:<p>(a) in view of a victory which had been achieved over some formidable enemies; and<p>(b) in view of some dangers still impending from a similar source.<p>The literal meaning of the passage here is, "In the turning of my enemies back;" that is, in their retreat, defeat, overthrow. So far as the Hebrew form of expression is concerned, this may either refer to what had been done, or to what would be; and may imply either that they had been turned back, or that the psalmist hoped and believed that they would be; for in either case the fact would show the divine perfections, and give occasion for gratitude and praise. The verbs with which this is connected - "they shall fall and perish" - are indeed in the Hebrew, as in our version, in the future tense; but this does not necessarily determine the question whether the psalmist refers to what had occurred or what would occur. His attitude is this: he contemplates his enemies as mighty and formidable; he sees the danger which exists when such enemies surround one; he looks at the interposition of God, and he sees that whenever it occurs it would be followed by this consequence, that they would stumble and fall before him. But while this verse does not determine the question whether he refers to what has been, or to what would be, the subsequent verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4-6</a> seem to settle it, where he speaks as if this were already done, and as if God had interposed in a remarkable manner in defeating his foes. I regard this, therefore, as a reflection on what had occurred, and as expressing what was then actually a ground of praise and thanksgiving.<p>They shall fall and perish - A general statement in view of what had occurred, meaning that this would always be the case.<p>At thy presence - Before thee; that is, when thou dost manifest thyself. This was the reason why they would stumble and fall, and is equivalent to saying, that "whenever mine enemies are turned back, the reason why they stumble and fall is "thy presence." It is the interposition of thy power. It is not to be traced to the prowess of man that they thus turn back, and that they fall and perish; it is to be traced to the fact that thou art present - that thou dost interpose." It is thus an acknowledgment of God as the author of the victory in all cases. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5.

As the Philistines were, when Goliath their champion was dead; and as the men that came to apprehend Christ, David's antitype, went backwards and fell to the ground, through the superior power of Christ; and as sin, Satan, and the world, and at last antichrist, are made to retreat from the Lord's people, who are more than conquerors over them through Christ that has loved them. "They shall fall and perish at thy presence"; they shall stumble at one thing or another which divine Providence will throw in their way to hinder them from executing their designs, and so fall before them they meant to destroy, and perish at the presence of God as wax melteth before the fire; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>; so antichrist shall be consumed with the breath of Christ's mouth, and the brightness of his coming, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>; and this is the ground and foundation of the psalmist's joy, and rejoicing, and singing praise to God as it will be the reason of the joy of saints in the latter day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-22.htm">Revelation 18:22</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3, 4</span>.

The poet is enthusiastic in his survey of this province of man's dominion. And his lofty poetic language corresponds to this enthusiasm. The enumeration begins with the domestic animals and passes on from these to the wild beasts-together the creatures that dwell on terra firma. &#1510;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1510;&#1504;&#1488; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-24.htm">Numbers 32:24</a>) from &#1510;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1510;&#1504;&#1488;) Arab. dna&#770; (dn'), as also Arab. da&#770;n, fut. o., proliferum esse is, in poetry, equivalent to &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, which is otherwise the usual name for small cattle. &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; (in Aramaic, as the name of the letter shows, a prose word) is in Hebrew poetically equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;; the oxen which willingly accommodate themselves to the service of man, especially of the husbandman, are so called from &#1488;&#1500;&#1507; to yield to. Wild animals, which in prose are called &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;) here bear the poetical name &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-22.htm">Joel 2:22</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-44.htm">1 Samuel 17:44</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; (in pause &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;) is the primitive form of &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, which is not declined, and has thereby obtained a collective signification. From the land animals the description passes on to the fowls of the air and the fishes of the water. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is the softer word, instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1507;; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is water. &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is the softer word, instead of &#1506;&#1493;&#1507;; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is used without the art. according to poetical usage, whereas &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; without the art. would have sounded too scanty and not sufficiently measured. In connection with &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; the article may be again omitted, just as with &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; is a collective participle. If the following were intended: he (or: since he), viz., man, passes through the paths of the sea (Bttcher, Cassel, and even Aben-Ezra and Kimchi), then it would not have been expressed in such a monostich, and in a form so liable to lead one astray. The words may be a comprehensive designation of that portion of the animal kingdom which is found in the sea; and this also intended to include all from the smallest worm to the gigantic leviathan: &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; (Apollinaris). If man thus rules over every living thing that is round about him from the nearest to the most remote, even that which is apparently the most untameable: then it is clear that every lifeless created thing in his vicinity must serve him as its king. The poet regards man in the light of the purpose for which he was created. </body></html>
