When we give thanks for some one particular mercy, we should remember former mercies. Our joy must not be in the gift, so much as in the Giver. The triumphs of the Redeemer ought to be the triumphs of the redeemed. The almighty power of God is that which the strongest and stoutest of his enemies are no way able to stand before. We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, and that with him there is no unrighteousness. His people may, by faith, flee to him as their Refuge, and may depend on his power and promise for their safety, so that no real hurt shall be done to them. Those who know him to be a God of truth and faithfulness, will rejoice in his word of promise, and rest upon that. Those who know him to be an everlasting Father, will trust him with their souls as their main care, and trust in him at all times, even to the end; and by constant care seek to approve themselves to him in the whole course of their lives. Who is there that would not seek him, who never hath forsaken those that seek Him?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will praise thee, O Lord - That is, in view of the merciful interpositions referred to in the psalm Psa 9:3-5, and in view of the attributes of God's character which had been displayed on that occasion <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7-12</a>.<p>With my whole heart - Not with divided affection, or with partial gratitude.

Upon Muthlabben, or, after the manner according to "death to the Son," by which some song was known, to whose air or melody the musician is directed to perform this Psalm. This mode of denoting a song by some prominent word or words is still common (compare [572]Ps 22:1). The Psalmist praises God for deliverance from his enemies and celebrates the divine government, for providing security to God's people and punishment to the wicked. Thus encouraging himself, he prays for new occasions to recount God's mercies, and confident of His continued judgment on the wicked and vindication of the oppressed, he implores a prompt and efficient manifestation of the divine sovereignty.<p>1.

It sometimes needs all our determination to face the foe and bless the Lord in the teeth of his enemies; vowing that whoever else may be silent we will bless his name; here, however, the overthrow of the foe is viewed as complete, and the song flows with sacred fulness of delight. It is our duty to praise the Lord; let us perform it as a privilege. Observe that David's praise is all given to the Lord. Praise is to be offered to God alone; we may be grateful to the intermediate agent, but our thanks must have long wings and mount aloft to heaven. With my whole heart. Half heart is no heart. I will show forth. There is true praise in the thankful telling forth to others of our heavenly Father's dealings with us; this is one of the themes upon which the godly should speak often to one another, and it will not be casting pearls before swine if we make even the ungodly hear of the loving-kindness of the Lord to us. All thy marvellous works. Gratitude for one mercy refreshes the memory as to thousands of others. One silver link in the chain draws up a long series of tender remembrances. Here is eternal work for us, for there can be no end to the showing forth of all his deeds of love. If we consider our own sinfulness and nothingness, we must feel that every work of preservation, forgiveness, conversion, deliverance, sanctification, &amp;c., which the Lord has wrought for us, or in us is a marvellous work. Even in heaven, divine loving-kindness will doubtless be as much a theme of surprise as of rapture.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-2.htm">Psalm 9:2</a><p>Gladness and joy are the appropriate spirit in which to praise the goodness of the Lord. Birds extol the Creator in notes of overflowing joy, the cattle low forth his praise with tumult of happiness, and the fish leap up in his worship with excess of delight. Moloch may be worshipped with shrieks of pain, and Juggernaut may be honoured by dying groans and inhuman yells, but he whose name is Love is best pleased with the holy mirth, and sanctified gladness of his people. Daily rejoicing is an ornament to the Christian character, and a suitable robe for God's choristers to wear. God loveth a cheerful giver, whether it be the gold of his purse or the gold of his mouth which he presents upon his altar. I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. Songs are the fitting expressions of inward thankfulness, and it were well if we indulged ourselves and honoured our Lord with more of them. Mr. B. P. Power has well said, "The sailors give a cheery cry as they weigh anchor, the ploughman whistles in the morning as he drives his team; the milkmaid sings her rustic song as she sets about her early task; when soldiers are leaving friends behind them, they do not march out to the tune of the Dead March in 'Saul,' but to the quick notes of some lively air. A praising spirit would do for us all that their songs and music do for them; and if only we could determine to praise the Lord, we should surmount many a difficulty which our low spirits never would have been equal to, and we should do double the work which can be done if the heart be languid in its beating, if we be crushed and trodden down in soul. As the evil spirit in Saul yielded in the olden time to the influence of the harp of the son of Jesse, so would the spirit of melancholy often take flight from us, if only we would take up the song of praise."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-3.htm">Psalm 9:3</a><p>God's presence is evermore sufficient to work the defeat of our most furious foes, and their ruin is so complete when the Lord takes them in hand, that even flight cannot save them, they fall to rise no more when he pursues them. We must be careful, like David, to give all the glory to him whose presence gives the victory. If we have here the exultings of our conquering Captain, let us make the triumphs of the Redeemer the triumphs of the redeemed, and rejoice with him at the total discomfiture of all his foes.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a><p>One of our nobility has for his motto, "I will maintain it;" but the Christian has a better and more humble one, "Thou hast maintained it." "God and my right," are united by my faith: while God lives my right shall never be taken from me. If we seek to maintain the cause and honour of our Lord we may suffer reproach and misrepresentation, but it is a rich comfort to remember that he who sits in the throne knows our hearts, and will not leave us to the ignorant and ungenerous judgment of erring man.<p>continued...<span class="bld">Muth-labben</span> also seems to be another title of some song, or tune, or instrument; of which we must and may be content to be ignorant, as the Jewish doctors also are.

The thanks are special for a great deliverance - a deliverance from some heathen enemy (vers. 5, 15), who has been signally defeated and almost exterminated (vers. 5, 6). It has been conjectured that the subjugation of Ammon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26-31</a>) is the occasion referred to ('Speaker's Commentary'); but the expectation of further attack (vers. 17-20) scarcely suits this period, when David's wars were well-nigh over.

The most natural thought would be: frail, puny man is as nothing before all this; but this thought is passed over in order to celebrate, with grateful emotion and astonished adoration, the divine love which appears in all the more glorious light, - a love which condescends to poor man, the dust of earth.

According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a> man is created &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, he is a being in the image of God, and, therefore, nearly a divine being. But when God says: "let us make man in our image after our likeness," He there connects Himself with the angels. The translation of the lxx &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, with which the Targum and the prevailing Jewish interpretations also harmonize, is, therefore, not unwarranted. Because in the biblical mode of conception the angels are so closely connected with God as the nearest creaturely effulgence of His nature, it is really possible that in &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; David may have thought of God including the angels. Since man is in the image of God, he is at the same time in the likeness of an angel, and since he is only a little less than divine, he is also only a little less than angelic. The position, somewhat exalted above the angels, which he occupies by being the bond between all created things, in so far as mind and matter are united in him, is here left out of consideration. The writer has only this one thing in his mind, that man is inferior to God, who is &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, and to the angels who are &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>) in this respect, that he is a material being, and on this very account a finite and mortal being; as Theodoret well and briefly observes: &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. This is the &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; in which whatever is wanting to him to make him a divine being is concentrated. But it is nothing more than &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;. The assertion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a> refers to the fact of the nature of man being in the image of God, and especially to the spirit breathed into him from God; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, to his godlike position as ruler in accordance with this his participation in the divine nature: honore ac decore coronasti eum. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; is the manifestation of glory described from the side of its weightiness and fulness; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; (cf. &#1492;&#1491;, &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491;) from the side of its far resounding announcement of itself (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>); &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; from the side of its brilliancy, majesty, and beauty. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>, or also &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, is the appellation of the divine doxa, with the image of which man is adorned as with a regal crown. The preceding fut. consec. also stamps &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; as historical retrospects. The next strophe unfolds the regal glory of man: he is the lord of all things, the lord of all earthly creatures. </body></html>
