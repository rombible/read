There is a day coming, when it will appear that he has not forgotten the cry of the humble; neither the cry of their blood, or the cry of their prayers. We are never brought so low, so near to death, but God can raise us up. If he has saved us from spiritual and eternal death, we may thence hope, that in all our distresses he will be a very present help to us. The overruling providence of God frequently so orders it, that persecutors and oppressors are brought to ruin by the projects they formed to destroy the people of God. Drunkards kill themselves; prodigals beggar themselves; the contentious bring mischief upon themselves: thus men's sins may be read in their punishment, and it becomes plain to all, that the destruction of sinners is of themselves. All wickedness came originally with the wicked one from hell; and those who continue in sin, must go to that place of torment. The true state, both of nations and of individuals, may be correctly estimated by this one rule, whether in their doings they remember or forget God. David encourages the people of God to wait for his salvation, though it should be long deferred. God will make it appear that he never did forget them: it is not possible he should. Strange that man, dust in his and about him, should yet need some sharp affliction, some severe visitation from God, to bring him to the knowledge of himself, and make him feel who and what he is.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When he maketh inquisition for blood - When he "inquires" after blood; that is, when he comes forth with this view, to wit, for purposes of punishment. There is allusion here to such passages as that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>, "And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man." The idea is, that when blood was shed in murder, God would seek out the murderer; he would require satisfaction of him who had shed the blood; he would punish the offender. The language, there, becomes equivalent to that of seeking punishment for murder, and then for sin in general; and the representation here is that of God as going forth in the capacity of an executioner of his own laws to inflict punishment on the guilty.<p>He remembereth them - "He remembereth," says Prof. Alexander, "the bloods or murders," since the word blood, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-6.htm">Psalm 5:6</a>, is in the plural - bloods. The better interpretation, however, is, that the word "them" here refers to the oppressed and the afflicted - for that is the main idea in the passage. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8-9</a>. When he goes forth in the earth to execute judgment on the wicked; when he cuts them down in his wrath; when he sweeps them away as with a flood - the punishment will not be indiscriminate. He will then mark the oppressed, the afflicted, the persecuted, the troubled, and the sad, and will interpose to save them - delivering them from the storms of wrath. The idea, then, is, that the righteous will not be forgotten; that even in the most fierce and awful of his dispensations he will still regard them, and interpose to save them.<p>He forgetteth not the cry of the humble - Margin, afflicted. The margin expresses the true idea. The reference is not to the humble in the common sense of that term, but to the afflicted; the oppressed; to those who are in trouble, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>. He will then remember the cry which in their afflictions they have been long sending up to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. for blood&#8212;that is, murders (Ps 5:6), including all the oppressions of His people.<p>maketh inquisition&#8212;(compare Ge 9:5).

The Arabic version renders it, "he remembers him that seeks their blood"; that is, the wicked man, that lies in wait for innocent blood, and whose feet are swift to shed it; the man of sin, who is bloodthirsty; who drinks up the blood of the saints like water, and has been made drunk with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, him will God remember, and take vengeance on, in his own time: but rather this is to be understood of God himself, seeking for the blood of his saints: he knows where it is, though ever so privily shed, as he did Abel's; yet, to show his strict care and accurate notice of it, he is represented as searching for it, and finding it out by secret search, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>. And it is the same phrase with "requiring" blood, and expresses a demand of satisfaction for it; and declares the vengeance that God will take on account of it: he requires the blood of every man at the hand of him by whom it is shed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; especially the blood of the righteous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>; particularly the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, shed by the Romish antichrist; he will make inquisition for that, and will find in Babylon the blood of the prophets and saints, and of all that are slain on earth; and will avenge the blood of his servants at her hand, and give her blood to drink, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-24.htm">Revelation 18:24</a>; <p>he remembereth them; either the "righteous", as the Targum paraphrases it, whose blood has been shed; or else the wicked, who shed their blood: God will remember them and their sins; which, for some time, may seem not to have been taken notice of by him, and will pour out his wrath, and inflict just punishment on them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <p>he forgetteth not the cry of the humble: the "Cetib", or writing of the text, is  "afflicted"; the "Keri", or marginal reading, is  "humble"; so the Masorah and Targum read: both may be taken into the sense: afflicted persons are generally humble, afflictions make them humble; God's people are an afflicted people; afflicted with sin, with Satan, with the world, with antichrist and his followers: and they are an humble people; grace makes them humble, and a sense of their sin and unworthiness keeps them so: and this is a proper character of the followers of Jesus. These in their distress cry to the Lord, as the Israelites did in Egypt under their bondage and, pressures: yea, their blood cries after death, as Abel's did, and as the blood of the martyrs of Christ does, whose souls under the altar cry for vengeance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>; and God is not unmindful of their cry; however he may seem to be, he takes notice of it, and wilt in his own time avenge his elect, which cry unto him day and night. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{e}</span> When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</span><p>(e) Though God does not suddenly avenge the wrong done to his, yet he does not permit the wicked to go unpunished.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>.

The traditional reading (<span class="ital">Qrî</span>) is ‘<span class="ital">anâvîm</span>, though the text (<span class="ital">Kthîbh</span>) has ‘<span class="ital">aniyyîm</span>. Both words are derived from the same root, meaning <span class="ital">to bend</span> or <span class="ital">bow down</span>. The first is intransitive in form, and denotes the character of one who bows himself down: <span class="ital">lowly, humble, meek</span> (LXX <span class="greekheb">πραΰς</span>). The second is passive in form, and denotes primarily the condition of one who is bowed down by external circumstances of poverty, trouble, or oppression: <span class="ital">poor, afflicted</span> (comp. the cognate substantive in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm" title="Have mercy on me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, you that lift me up from the gates of death:">Psalm 9:13</a></span>, <span class="ital">my trouble</span>, R.V, <span class="ital">affliction</span>). But inasmuch as humility is learnt in the school of affliction and, poverty (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>), it often has the secondary sense of <span class="ital">meek, humble</span> (LXX generally <span class="greekheb">πτωχός</span>, <span class="greekheb">πένης</span>, sometimes <span class="greekheb">ταπεινός</span> or <span class="greekheb">πραΰς</span>), and the distinction between the two words is lost. The second of the two words (but not the first) is often coupled or in parallelism with <span class="ital">ebhyôn</span> ‘needy,’ <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-18.htm" title="For the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.">Psalm 9:18</a></span>), or <span class="ital">dal</span> ‘weak,’ ‘feeble’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/82-3.htm" title="Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy....">Psalm 82:3-4</a>); and these words also, though primarily denoting condition, tend to acquire a moral significance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘afflicted,’ ‘poor,’ ‘meek,’ ‘humble,’ are a class that meet us frequently in the Psalms and Prophets. They are those whose condition specially calls for the special protection of Jehovah, and of righteous rulers who are His true representatives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm" title="In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endures.">Psalm 72:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-4.htm" title="He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.">Psalm 72:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-12.htm" title="For he shall deliver the needy when he cries; the poor also, and him that has no helper.">Psalm 72:12</a>); and whose character for the most part fits them to be objects of the divine favour. They are contrasted with the proud, the scorners, the oppressors, whose contemptuous independence and high-handed violence will meet with due punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-34.htm" title="Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace to the lowly.">Proverbs 3:34</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for he that maketh inquisition for blood</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>) <span class="accented">remembereth them.</span> God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Requirer of blood (Kay), remembers, when he makes his inquisition, those who are oppressed (per. 9), and who seek him (ver. 10).

He does not celebrate the judicial act of God on his behalf, which he has just experienced, alone, but in connection with, and, as it were, as the sum of many others which have preceded it. If this is the case, then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-6.htm">Psalm 9:6</a> beside the Ammonites one may at the same time (with Hengstenb.) think of the Amalekites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-12.htm">1 Samuel 8:12</a>), who had been threatened since the time of Moses with a "blotting out of their remembrance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-19.htm">Deuteronomy 25:19</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>). The divine threatening is the word of omnipotence which destroys in distinction from the word of omnipotence that creates. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; in close connection with &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; is individualising, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-18.htm">Psalm 9:18</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a>. &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is a sharpened pausal form for &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, the Pathach going into a Segol (&#1511;&#1496;&#1503; &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;); perhaps it is in order to avoid the threefold a-sound in &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; (Ngelsbach 8 extr.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a> &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; (with Azla legarme) appears to be a vocative. In that case &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468; ought also to be addressed to the enemy. But if it be interpreted: "Thou hast destroyed thine own cities, their memorial is perished," destroyed, viz., at the challenge of Israel, then the thought is forced; and if we render it: "the cities, which thou hast destroyed, perished is the remembrance of them," i.e., one no longer thinks of thine acts of conquest, then we have a thought that is in itself awkward and one that finds no support in any of the numerous parallels which speak of a blotting out and leaving no trace behind. But, moreover, in both these interpretations the fact that &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501; is strengthened by &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is lost sight of, and the twofold masculine &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is referred to &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (which is carelessly done by most expositors), whereas &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, with but few exceptions, is feminine; consequently &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, so far as this is not absolutely impossible, must be referred to the enemies themselves (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-15.htm">Psalm 109:15</a>). &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; might more readily be nom. absol.: "the enemy - it is at end for ever with his destructions," but &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; never has an active but always only a neuter signification; or: "the enemy - ruins are finished for ever," but the signification to be destroyed is more natural for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; than to be completed, when it is used of ruinae. Moreover, in connection with both these renderings the retrospective pronoun (&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;) is wanting, and this is also the case with the reading &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; (lxx, Vulg., Syr.), which leaves it uncertain whose swords are meant. But why may we not rather connect &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; at once with &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; as subject? In other instances &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is also joined to a singular collective subject, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>; here it precedes, like &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-37.htm">Judges 20:37</a>. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; is a nominative of the product, corresponding to the factitive object with verbs of making: the enemies are destroyed as ruins for ever, i.e., so that they are become ruins; or, more in accordance with the accentuation: the enemy, destroyed as ruins are they for ever. With respect to what follows the accentuation also contains hints worthy of our attention. It does not take &#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468; (with the regular Pathach by Athnach after Olewejored, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>) as a relative clause, and consequently does not require &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; to be referred back to &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;.<p>We interpret the passage thus: and cities (viz., such as were hostile) thou hast destroyed (&#1504;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473; evellere, exstirpare), perished is their (the enemies') memorial. Thus it also now becomes intelligible, why &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501;, according to the rule Ges. 121, 3, is so remarkably strengthened by the addition of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-32.htm">Numbers 14:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-42.htm">1 Samuel 20:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>). Hupfeld, whose interpretation is exactly the same as ours, thinks it might perhaps be the enemies themselves and the cities set over against one another. But the contrast follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a> : their, even their memorial is perished, while on the contrary Jahve endures for ever and is enthroned as judge. This contrast also retrospectively gives support to the explanation, that &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501; refers not to the cities, but to &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; as a collective. With this interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a> we have no occasion to read &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501; &#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (Targ.), nor &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (Paul., Hitz.). The latter is strongly commended by <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/11-20.htm">Job 11:20</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2</a>; but still it is not quite admissible, since &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; here is not subjective (their own remembrance) but objective (remembrance of them). But may not &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; perhaps here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-20.htm">Psalm 139:20</a>, mean zealots  equals  adversaries (from &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; fervere, zelare)? We reply in the negative, because the Psalm bears neither an Aramaising nor a North Palestinian impress. Even in connection with this meaning, the harshness of the &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; without any suffix would still remain. But, that the cities that are, as it were, plucked up by the root are cities of the enemy, is evident from the context. </body></html>
