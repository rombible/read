When we give thanks for some one particular mercy, we should remember former mercies. Our joy must not be in the gift, so much as in the Giver. The triumphs of the Redeemer ought to be the triumphs of the redeemed. The almighty power of God is that which the strongest and stoutest of his enemies are no way able to stand before. We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, and that with him there is no unrighteousness. His people may, by faith, flee to him as their Refuge, and may depend on his power and promise for their safety, so that no real hurt shall be done to them. Those who know him to be a God of truth and faithfulness, will rejoice in his word of promise, and rest upon that. Those who know him to be an everlasting Father, will trust him with their souls as their main care, and trust in him at all times, even to the end; and by constant care seek to approve themselves to him in the whole course of their lives. Who is there that would not seek him, who never hath forsaken those that seek Him?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will be glad - I will rejoice, and will express my joy.<p>And rejoice in thee - I will exult; I will triumph.

Upon Muthlabben, or, after the manner according to "death to the Son," by which some song was known, to whose air or melody the musician is directed to perform this Psalm. This mode of denoting a song by some prominent word or words is still common (compare [572]Ps 22:1). The Psalmist praises God for deliverance from his enemies and celebrates the divine government, for providing security to God's people and punishment to the wicked. Thus encouraging himself, he prays for new occasions to recount God's mercies, and confident of His continued judgment on the wicked and vindication of the oppressed, he implores a prompt and efficient manifestation of the divine sovereignty.<p>1.

The principal thought towards which the rest tends is <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a> (parallel are <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a> a, 3), and consequently <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a> is the protasis (par., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>), and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; accordingly is  equals  quum, quando, in the sense of quoties. As often as he gazes at the heavens which bear upon themselves the name of God in characters of light (wherefore he says &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498;), the heavens with their boundless spaces (an idea which lies in the plur. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;) extending beyond the reach of mortal eye, the moon (&#1497;&#1512;&#1495;, dialectic &#1493;&#1512;&#1495;, perhaps, as Maurer derives it, from &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;  equals  &#1497;&#1512;&#1511; subflavum esse), and beyond this the innumerable stars which are lost in infinite space (&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; prop. round, ball-shaped, spherical bodies) to which Jahve appointed their fixed place on the vault of heaven which He has formed with all the skill of His creative wisdom (&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; to place and set up, in the sense of existence and duration): so often does the thought "what is mortal man...?" increase in power and intensity. The most natural thought would be: frail, puny man is as nothing before all this; but this thought is passed over in order to celebrate, with grateful emotion and astonished adoration, the divine love which appears in all the more glorious light, - a love which condescends to poor man, the dust of earth. Even if &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; does not come from &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473; to be fragile, nevertheless, according to the usage of the language, it describes man from the side of his impotence, frailty, and mortality (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, also, is not without a similar collateral reference. With retrospective reference to &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a> : man, who is not, like the stars, God's directly creative work, but comes into being through human agency born of woman. From both designations it follows that it is the existing generation of man that is spoken of. Man, as we see him in ourselves and others, this weak and dependent being is, nevertheless, not forgotten by God, God remembers him and looks about after him (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; of observing attentively, especially visitation, and with the accus. it is generally used of lovingly provident visitation, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>). He does not leave him to himself, but enters into personal intercourse with him, he is the special and favoured object whither His eye turns (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>, and the parody of the tempted one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>.).<p>It is not until <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a> that the writer glances back at creation. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (differing from the fut. consec. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-18.htm">Job 7:18</a>) describes that which happened formerly. &#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1503; signifies to cause to be short of, wanting in something, to deprive any one of something (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>). &#1502;&#1503; is here neither comparative (paullo inferiorem eum fecisti Deo), nor negative (paullum derogasti ei, ne esset Deus), but partitive (paullum derogasti ei divinae naturae); and, without &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; being on that account an abstract plural, paullum Deorum,  equals  Dei (vid., Genesis S. 66f.), is equivalent to paullum numinis Deorum. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a> man is created &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, he is a being in the image of God, and, therefore, nearly a divine being. But when God says: "let us make man in our image after our likeness," He there connects Himself with the angels. The translation of the lxx &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, with which the Targum and the prevailing Jewish interpretations also harmonize, is, therefore, not unwarranted. Because in the biblical mode of conception the angels are so closely connected with God as the nearest creaturely effulgence of His nature, it is really possible that in &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; David may have thought of God including the angels. Since man is in the image of God, he is at the same time in the likeness of an angel, and since he is only a little less than divine, he is also only a little less than angelic. The position, somewhat exalted above the angels, which he occupies by being the bond between all created things, in so far as mind and matter are united in him, is here left out of consideration. The writer has only this one thing in his mind, that man is inferior to God, who is &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, and to the angels who are &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>) in this respect, that he is a material being, and on this very account a finite and mortal being; as Theodoret well and briefly observes: &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. This is the &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; in which whatever is wanting to him to make him a divine being is concentrated. But it is nothing more than &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;. The assertion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a> refers to the fact of the nature of man being in the image of God, and especially to the spirit breathed into him from God; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, to his godlike position as ruler in accordance with this his participation in the divine nature: honore ac decore coronasti eum. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; is the manifestation of glory described from the side of its weightiness and fulness; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; (cf. &#1492;&#1491;, &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491;) from the side of its far resounding announcement of itself (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>); &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; from the side of its brilliancy, majesty, and beauty. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>, or also &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-5.htm">Psalm 145:5</a>, is the appellation of the divine doxa, with the image of which man is adorned as with a regal crown. The preceding fut. consec. also stamps &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; as historical retrospects. The next strophe unfolds the regal glory of man: he is the lord of all things, the lord of all earthly creatures. </body></html>
