When we give thanks for some one particular mercy, we should remember former mercies. Our joy must not be in the gift, so much as in the Giver. The triumphs of the Redeemer ought to be the triumphs of the redeemed. The almighty power of God is that which the strongest and stoutest of his enemies are no way able to stand before. We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, and that with him there is no unrighteousness. His people may, by faith, flee to him as their Refuge, and may depend on his power and promise for their safety, so that no real hurt shall be done to them. Those who know him to be a God of truth and faithfulness, will rejoice in his word of promise, and rest upon that. Those who know him to be an everlasting Father, will trust him with their souls as their main care, and trust in him at all times, even to the end; and by constant care seek to approve themselves to him in the whole course of their lives. Who is there that would not seek him, who never hath forsaken those that seek Him?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they that know thy name - All who are acquainted with thee; all those who have been made acquainted with the manifestations of thy goodness, and with the truth respecting thy character.<p>Will put their trust in thee - That is, all who have any just views of God, or who understand his real character, will confide in him. This is as much as to say, that he has a character which is worthy of confidence - since they who know him best most unreservedly rely on him. It is the same as saying that all the revelations of his character in his word and works are such as to make it proper to confide in him. The more intimate our knowledge of God, the more entirely shall we trust in him; the more we learn of his real character, the more shall we see that he is worthy of universal love. It is much to say of anyone that the more he is known the more he will be loved; and in saying this of God, it is but saying that one reason why men do not confide in him is that they do not understand his real character.<p>For thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee - Thou hast never left them when they have come to time with a confiding heart. David means, doubtless, to refer here particularly to his own case, to derive a conclusion from his particular case in regard to the general character of God. But what is here affirmed is still true, and always has been true, and always will be true, that God does not forsake those who put their trust in him. Men forsake him; he does not forsake them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10.

"To know the Name of God is to know him according to his historical manifestation; when one hears him named, to call to remembrance all that he has done. His name is the focus in which all the rays of his actions meet" (Hengstenberg). All who "know God's Name" in this sense will be sure to "put their trust in him," since his historical manifestation shows that he is thoroughly to he depended on. <span class="cmt_word">For thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee</span>. Never in the past, so far as David knew, had God forsaken those who faithfully clung to him. They might be tried, like Job; they might be "hunted upon the mountains," like David himself; they might even have the sense of being forsaken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>); but they were not forsaken nevertheless. God "forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 9:4-5) The call upon himself to thanksgiving sounds forth, and the &#1489;-strophe continues it by expressing the ground of it. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; in this instance expresses both the time and the reason together (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>); in Latin it is recedentibus hostibus meis retro. &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; serves to strengthen the notion of being driven back, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-10.htm">Psalm 56:10</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-11.htm">Psalm 44:11</a>; and just as, in Latin, verbs compounded of re are strengthened by retro. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a> finite verbs take the place of the infinitive construct; here we have futt. with a present signification, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7</a> we find a praet. intended as perfect. For the rendering which Hitzig adopts: When mine enemies retreat backwards, they stumble... is opposed both by the absence of any syntactic indication in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a> of an apodosis (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>); and also by the fact that &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is well adapted to be a continuation of the description of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a>), but is tame as a principal clause to the definitive clause &#1489;&#1513;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;. Moreover, &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; does not signify backwards (which would rather be &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-23.htm">Genesis 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-18.htm">1 Samuel 4:18</a>), but back, or into the rear. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; is the &#1502;&#1503; of the cause, whence the action proceeds. What is intended is God's angry countenance, the look of which sets his enemies on fire as if they were fuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-10.htm">Psalm 21:10</a>), in antithesis to God's countenance as beaming with the light of His love. Now, while this is taking place, and because of its taking place, will be sing praise to God. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-2.htm">Psalm 9:2</a> we see that the Psalm is composed directly after the victory and while the destructive consequences of it to the vanquished are still in operation. David sees in it all an act of Jahve's judicial power. To execute any one's right, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-9.htm">Micah 7:9</a>), to bring to an issue any one's suit or lawful demand, &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-13.htm">Psalm 140:13</a>), is equivalent to: to assist him and his good cause in securing their right. The phrases are also used in a judicial sense without the suffix. The genitive object after these principal words never denotes the person against whom, but the person on whose behalf, the third party steps forward with his judicial authority. Jahve has seated Himself upon His judgment-seat as a judge of righteousness (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>), i.e., as a judge whose judicial mode of procedure is righteousness, justice, <p>(Note: Also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-16.htm">Proverbs 8:16</a> is probably to be read &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;, with Norzi, according to the Targum, Syriac version, and old Codices; at any rate this is an old various reading, and one in accordance with the sense, side by side with &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;.)<p>and has decided in his favour. In &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1500; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>), which is distinguished in this respect from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-9.htm">Psalm 47:9</a>), the idea of motion, considere, comes prominently forward. </body></html>
