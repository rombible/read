We are apt to show our troubles too much to ourselves, poring upon them, which does us no service; whereas, by showing them to God, we might cast the cares upon him who careth for us, and thereby ease ourselves. Nor should we allow any complaint to ourselves or others, which we cannot make to God. When our spirits are overwhelmed by distress, and filled with discouragement; when we see snares laid for us on every side, while we walk in his way, we may reflect with comfort that the Lord knoweth our path. Those who in sincerity take the Lord for their God, find him all-sufficient, as a Refuge, and as a Portion: every thing else is a refuge of lies, and a portion of no value. In this situation David prayed earnestly to God. We may apply it spiritually; the souls of believers are often straitened by doubts and fears. And it is then their duty and interest to beg of God to set them at liberty, that they may run the way of his commandments. Thus the Lord delivered David from his powerful persecutors, and dealt bountifully with him. Thus he raised the crucified Redeemer to the throne of glory, and made him Head over all things for his church. Thus the convinced sinner cries for help, and is brought to praise the Lord in the company of his redeemed people; and thus all believers will at length be delivered from this evil world, from sin and death, and praise their Saviour for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/142.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I cried unto thee, O Lord - When there was no help; when I saw myself encompassed with dangers; when I looked on every hand and there was no "man" that would undertake for me.<p>I said, Thou art my refuge - <p>(a) My "only" refuge.

From this point the Psalm gradually dies away in strains comparatively easy to be understood and in perfect keeping with the situation. In connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-8.htm">Psalm 141:8</a> one is reminded of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-15.htm">Psalm 25:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a>; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-9.htm">Psalm 141:9</a>., of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23</a>, and other passages. In "pour not out (&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; with sharpened vowel instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, Ges. &#1431;75, rem. 8) my soul," &#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, Piel, is equivalent to the Hiph. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1508;&#1495; are as it were the hands of the seizing and capturing snare; and &#1497;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; is virtually a genitive: qui insidias tendunt mihi, since one cannot say &#1497;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1495;, ponere laqueum. &#1502;&#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, nets, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a> is another hapaxlegomenon; the enallage numeri is as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>, - the singular that slips in refers what is said of the many to each individual in particular.

With &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; the poet gives prominence to his simultaneous, distinct destiny: simul ego dum (&#1506;&#1491; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/8-21.htm">Job 8:21</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18</a>) praetereo h.e. evado. The inverted position of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10-12</a> may be compared; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-7.htm">Psalm 120:7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-14.htm">2 Kings 2:14</a>, however (where instead of &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; it is with Thenius to be read &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488;), the case is different. </body></html>
