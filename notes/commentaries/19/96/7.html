A truly Messianic character is thus impressed on the psalm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/96.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/96-7.htm" title="Give to the LORD, O you kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength....">Psalm 96:7-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people — </span>O ye people, from whatsoever family ye come, or, O ye nations of the world, <span class="ital">Give unto the Lord glory and strength — </span>Ascribe to Jehovah that incomparable majesty, and supreme dominion and authority, which you have been wont to give to your imaginary gods. <span class="ital">Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name — </span>Renouncing all your idols, acknowledge Jehovah alone to be the omnipotent king of all the world, and do him honour suitable to the excellence of his majesty. <span class="ital">Bring an offering, and come into his courts — </span>The courts of his house. Bring him an oblation, in token of your subjection to him; and humbly worship him in his temple. He speaks of the worship of the New Testament under the expressions of the Jewish worship, as the prophets elsewhere do: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm" title="For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:11</a>. <span class="ital">O worship the Lord </span>— O come and cast yourselves down before the Lord, <span class="ital">in the beauty of holiness — </span>In his <span class="ital">sanctuary, </span>where he hath fixed his glorious residence among us; or, rather, being clothed with all those holy ornaments, those gifts and graces, which are necessary and required in God’s worship. <span class="ital">Fear before him, all the earth — </span>Let all the people approach his presence with a holy fear and sacred reverence, standing in awe of, and dreading to offend, their sovereign Lord and King.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/96.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>96:1-9 When Christ finished his work on earth, and was received into his glory in heaven, the church began to sing a new song unto him, and to bless his name. His apostles and evangelists showed forth his salvation among the heathen, his wonders among all people. All the earth is here summoned to worship the Lord. We must worship him in the beauty of holiness, as God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Glorious things are said of him, both as motives to praise and matter of praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/96.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give unto the Lord - Ascribe unto the Lord - to Yahweh. This is extracted literally from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-28.htm">1 Chronicles 16:28</a>.<p>O ye kindreds of the people - Hebrew, "Families" of the people: people, as united by family ties. The idea is that of worship not merely as individuals, nor as a mere "aggregate" of individuals united by no common bonds, but as those united by strong ties; bound by blood and affection; constituted into communities. It is a call on such to worship God in their capacity as thus bound together; to come as families and to worship God. In other words, it is a call on families "as such" to acknowledge God. A family is a proper place where to honor God. When the same joy pervades all hearts in prosperity, and when all are alike made sorrowful in adversity, there is an evident fitness that all should unite in the same worship of God; and that, as in all other things they have common interests, sympathies, and affections, so they should have in religion - in the service of their Creator.<p>Give unto the Lord glory and strength - That is, Proclaim that these belong to God; or, worship him as a God of glory and power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/96.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9.
