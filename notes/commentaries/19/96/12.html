He shall rule in the hearts of men, by the power of truth, and the Spirit of righteousness. His coming draws nigh; this King, this Judge standeth before the door, but he is not yet come. The Lord will accept the praises of all who seek to promote the kingdom of Christ. The sea can but roar, and how the trees of the wood can show that they rejoice we know not; but He that searches the heart knows what is the mind of the Spirit, and understands the words, the broken language of the weakest. Christ will come to judge the earth, to execute just vengeance on his enemies, and to fulfil his largest promises to his people. What then are we? Would that day be welcome to us? If this be not our case, let us now begin to prepare to meet our God, by seeking the pardon of our sins, and the renewal of our souls to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/96.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the field be joyful ... - This is taken - with the change of a single letter, not affecting the sense - from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-32.htm">1 Chronicles 16:32-33</a>. It is a call on the fields - the cultivated portions of the earth - to rejoice in the reign of God. As if conscious of the beauty with which he clothes them, and of the happiness which they confer on man in their beauty and in the abundance of their productions, they are called on to praise God.<p>Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice - The forests - the oaks, the cedars, the pines, that wave with so much majesty. If they were conscious of their own magnificence and beauty - if they could see how much wisdom and goodness God has lavished on them, in their forms, their branches, their leaves, their flowers, their fruit - if they could know how much they are made to accomplish in rendering the world beautiful, and in contributing to the happiness of man - if they understood what a bare, bleak, cold, desert world this would be but for them, they, too, would have abundant occasion for praise and joy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/96.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13.

Not the field of the world, but of the church, separated from others by distinguishing grace; the peculiar property of Christ, cultivated and manured by his Spirit and grace, and abounding with the fruits and flowers thereof; of a wilderness becoming a fruitful field, and for that reason should rejoice, even with joy and singing, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>, <p>then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice; the sons of God, so called, Sol 2:3, who, though like such, in their nature state, barren and unfruitful, yet, being ingrafted into Christ, become trees of righteousness; and so have reason to rejoice at their root in Christ, their stability by him, and fruitfulness through him: Jarchi interprets this of all the governors of the people; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>, all this, indeed, by a prosopopoeia, may be understood of inanimate creatures; the heavens, earth, and sea, fields, woods, and trees, rejoicing, if they could, and in their way, at such great and wonderful appearances in the Gentile world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>.

All the elohim, i.e., gods, of the peoples are &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (from the negative &#1488;&#1500;), nothings and good-for-nothings, unreal and useless. The lxx renders &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, as though the expression were &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>), more correctly &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>. What <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a> says is wrought out in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44.htm">Isaiah 44</a>, and elsewhere; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is a name of idols that occurs nowhere more frequently than in Isaiah. The sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>) is here the earthly sanctuary. From Jerusalem, over which the light arises first of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>), Jahve's superterrestrial doxa now reveals itself in the world. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1470;&#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512; is the usual pair of words for royal glory.
