So the version of Apollinaris, “Pureness and stately glory fit his shrine.” The chronicler having adopted this psalm as suitable for the occasion when the ark was brought to Zion by David, has substituted “strength and gladness are in his <span class= "ital">place” </span>possibly because the Temple was not built at that time.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/96.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>96:1-9 When Christ finished his work on earth, and was received into his glory in heaven, the church began to sing a new song unto him, and to bless his name. His apostles and evangelists showed forth his salvation among the heathen, his wonders among all people. All the earth is here summoned to worship the Lord. We must worship him in the beauty of holiness, as God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Glorious things are said of him, both as motives to praise and matter of praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/96.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Honour and majesty are before him - This part of the verse is taken literally from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-27.htm">1 Chronicles 16:27</a>. The meaning is, that that which constitutes honor, glory, majesty, is in his presence, or wherever he is. Whereever he manifests himself, there are the exhibitions of honor and majesty. They are always the accompaniments of his presence.<p>Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary - This is slightly varied from the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-27.htm">1 Chronicles 16:27</a>. The word rendered "strength" is in both places the same. The word rendered "beauty" here - &#1514;&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514;  tiph'ereth - is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-27.htm">1 Chronicles 16:27</a> &#1495;&#1491;&#1493;&#1492;  chedva&#770;h - "joy or gladness." The word here rendered "sanctuary" - &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  miqda&#770;sh - is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-27.htm">1 Chronicles 16:27</a> - &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;  ma&#770;qo&#770;m - "place." These variations are such as to show that the psalm is not a mere extract, but that it was altered of design, and adapted to the occasion on which it was to be employed - confirming the supposition that it may have been used in the re-dedication of the temple after the return from the captivity. The word "sanctuary" refers to the holy place where God dwells; his sacred abode, whether his residence in heaven, or the temple on earth as the place of his earthly habitation. When it is said that "strength" is there, it means that the dwelling-place of God is the source of "power," or that power emanates from thence; that is, from God himself. When it is said that "beauty" is there, the meaning is, that whatever is suited to charm by loveliness; whatever is a real ornament; whatever makes the world attractive; whatever beautifies and adorns creation, has its home in God; it proceeds from him. It may be added that whatever there is of "power" to reform the world, and convert sinners; whatever there is to turn people from their vicious and abandoned course of life; whatever there is to make the world better and happier, proceeds from the "sanctuary" - the church of God. Whatever there is that truly adorns society, and makes it more lovely and attractive; whatever there is that diffuses a charm over domestic and social life; whatever there is that makes the world more lovely or more desirable to live in - more courteous, more gentle, more humane, more kind, more forgiving - has its home in the "sanctuary," or emanates from the church of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/96.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

He being set down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, and having honour and majesty laid upon him; being arrayed in robes of majesty, crowned with glory and honour, sitting on the same throne of glory with his Father, and having a sceptre of righteousness in his hand, and all the forms and ensigns of royalty and majesty about him; rays of light and glory darting from him; as well as those glorious and bright forms before him; the holy angels continually praising him; which is a much more noble sense than that of Kimchi's, who interprets them of the stars: <p>strength and beauty are in his sanctuary; the Targum is, <p>"the house of his sanctuary,'' <p>the temple; the Gospel church, of which the temple or sanctuary was a figure: the strength of Christ is seen here, in the conversion of sinners by his Gospel, which is the rod of his strength, the power of God unto salvation, when it comes not in word only; and by which he also strengthens his people to the more vigorous exercise of grace and discharge of duty; here they go from strength to strength: the "beauty" of Christ is seen here; the King is held in the galleries of Gospel ordinances, and is beheld in his beauty; his people appear here in the beauties of holiness, and as a perfection of beauty, through the righteousness of Christ upon them; and as they observe the order of the Gospel, and do all things decently, and with a good decorum: or else, as Kimchi interprets it, heaven may be meant by the sanctuary, of which the holy place, made with hands, was a figure; here Christ reigns, girded with "strength"; here he rules as the Lord God omnipotent, having all power in heaven, and in earth, and doing according to his will in both; and from hence he shows himself strong on the behalf of his people; here. He, who is beauty itself, fairer than the children of men, dwells; here those beauteous forms of light and glory, the holy angels, are; and here the spirits of just men made perfect, who are without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, have their abode: in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-27.htm">1 Chronicles 16:27</a>, it is, <p>strength and gladness are in his place; among his people and worshippers there. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/96.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Honour and majesty <i>are</i> before him: strength and beauty <i>are</i> in his sanctuary.</span><p>(d) God cannot be known but by his strength and glory, the signs of which appear in his sanctuary.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/96.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-13.htm" title="The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.">Isaiah 60:13</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-27.htm" title="Glory and honor are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.">1 Chronicles 16:27</a> reads “Strength and gladness are in his place,” possibly to adapt the Psalm for the occasion when the Temple did not yet exist.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/96.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Honour and majesty are before him</span>.

When the psalms came to be used in the temple service, loftier language was more fitting. The whole passage has probable reference to the glory of God as seated between the cherubim in the first temple. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/95.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second decastich begins in the midst of the Masoretic <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>. Up to this point the church stirs itself up to a worshipping appearing before its God; now the voice of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-7.htm">Hebrews 4:7</a>), earnestly admonishing, meets it, resounding from out of the sanctuary. Since &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468; signifies not merely to hear, but to hear obediently, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a> cannot be a conditioning protasis to what follows. Hengstenberg wishes to supply the apodosis: "then will He bless you, His people;" but &#1488;&#1501; in other instances too (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-19.htm">Psalm 139:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11</a>), like &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, has an optative signification, which it certainly has gained by a suppression of a promissory apodosis, but yet without the genius of the language having any such in mind in every instance. The word &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; placed first gives prominence to the present, in which this call to obedience goes forth, as a decisive turning-point. The divine voice warningly calls to mind the self-hardening of Israel, which came to light at Mer&#1502;bah, on the day of Massah. What is referred to, as also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/81-8.htm">Psalm 81:8</a>, is the tempting of God in the second year of the Exodus on account of the failing of water in the neighbourhood of Horeb, at the place which is for this reason called Massah u-Mer&#305;&#770;bah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>); from which is to be distinguished the tempting of God in the fortieth year of the Exodus at Mer&#305;&#770;bah, viz., at the waters of contention near Kadesh (written fully Me&#770;-Mer&#305;&#770;bah Kadesh, or more briefly Me&#770;-Mer&#305;&#770;bah), <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-2.htm">Numbers 20:2-13</a> (cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-20.htm">Psalm 78:20</a>). Strictly &#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; signifies nothing but instar Meribae, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-10.htm">Psalm 83:10</a> instar Midianitarum; but according to the sense, &#1499;&#1468; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32</a>, just as &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;. On &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, quum, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>. The meaning of &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1508;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is not they also (&#1490;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>) saw His work; for the reference to the giving of water out of the rock would give a thought that is devoid of purpose here, and the assertion is too indefinite for it to be understood of the judgment upon those who tempted God (Hupfeld and Hitzig). It is therefore rather to be rendered: notwithstanding (ho'moos, Ew. 354, a) they had ( equals  although they had, cf. &#1490;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>) seen His work (His wondrous guiding and governing), and might therefore be sure that He would not suffer them to be destroyed. The verb &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; coincides with &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; .&#1506;&#1503;, for which the lxx has &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, is anarthrous in order that the notion may be conceived of more qualitatively than relatively: with a (whole) generation. With &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; Jahve calls to mind the repeated declarations of His vexation concerning their heart, which was always inclined towards error which leads to destruction - declarations, however, which bore no fruit. Just this ineffectiveness of His indignation had as its result that (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, not &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; but &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-51.htm">Deuteronomy 28:51</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>, and frequently) He sware, etc. (&#1488;&#1501;  equals  verily not, Gesen. 155, 2, f, with the emphatic future form in n which follows). It is the oath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-27.htm">Numbers 14:27</a>. that is meant. The older generation died in the desert, and therefore lost the entering into the rest of God, by reason of their disobedience. If now, many centuries after Moses, they are invited in the Davidic Psalter to submissive adoration of Jahve, with the significant call: "To-day if ye will hearken to His voice!" and with a reference to the warning example of the fathers, the obedience of faith, now as formerly, has therefore to look forward to the gracious reward of entering into God's rest, which the disobedient at that time lost; and the taking possession of Canaan was, therefore, not as yet the final &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9</a>). This is the connection of the wider train of thought which to the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews Heb 3:1, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1</a>, follows from this text of the Psalm. </body></html>
