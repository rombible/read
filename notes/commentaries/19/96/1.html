This is the only addition made to the original form of the psalm. The word new here implies that there was some fresh occasion for celebrating the praises of God; that some event had occurred, or that some truth relating to the divine character had now been made known, which could not well be expressed in any psalm or hymn then in use. It is a call on all to celebrate the praises of the Lord in a "new" song - new, particularly, as it calls on "all the earth" to join in it; and possibly this was designed to suggest the idea that while that temple stood, a dispensation would commence, under which the distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles would be broken down, and all mankind would unite in the praise of God.<p>Sing unto the Lord, all the earth - All nations. All people had occasion to bless his name; to praise him. What he had done, what he was still doing, was of interest to all lands, and made an appeal to all people to praise him. The psalm is constructed on this supposition, that the occasion for praise referred to was one in which all people were interested; or, in other words, that Yahweh was the true God over all the nations, and that all people should acknowledge him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/96.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 96<p>Ps 96:1-13. The substance of this Psalm, and portions of the ninety-seventh, ninety-eighth, and hundredth, are found in 1Ch 16:7-36, which was used by David's directions in the dedication of the tabernacle on Mount Zion. The dispensation of the Messiah was typified by that event, involving, as it did, a more permanent seat of worship, and the introduction of additional and more spiritual services. Hence the language of these Psalms may be regarded as having a higher import than that pertinent to the occasion on which it was thus publicly used.<p>1-3.

The derivation from &#1493;&#1506;&#1507; (&#1497;&#1506;&#1507;), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, also does not suit &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a>, for "fatigues" and "indefatigableness" are notions that lie very wide apart. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm">Job 22:25</a> might more readily be explained according to this "silver of fatigues," i.e., silver that the fatiguing labour of mining brings to light, and &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in the passage before us, with Gussetius, Geier, and Hengstenberg: cacumina montium quia defatigantur qui eo ascendunt, prop. ascendings  equals  summits of the mountains, after which &#1499;&#1505;&#1507; &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm">Job 22:25</a>, might also signify "silver of the mountain-heights." But the lxx, which renders &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; in the passages in Numbers and &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; in the passage before us, leads one to a more correct track. The verb &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; (&#1493;&#1506;&#1507;), transposed from &#1497;&#1508;&#1506; (&#1493;&#1508;&#1506;), goes back to the root &#1497;&#1507;, &#1493;&#1507;, to stand forth, tower above, to be high, according to which &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;  equals  &#1514;&#1493;&#1508;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; signifies eminentiae, i.e., towerings  equals  summits, or prominences  equals  high (the highest) perfection (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm">Job 22:25</a>). In the passage before us it is a synonym of the Arabic m&#305;&#770;fan, m&#305;&#770;fa&#770;tun, pars terrae eminens (from Arab. wfa&#770;  equals  &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;, prop. instrumentally: a means of rising above, viz., by climbing), and of the names of eminences derived from Arab. yf' (after which Hitzig renders: the teeth of the mountains). By reason of the fact that Jahve is the Owner (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>), because the Creator of all things, the call to worship, which concerns no one so nearly as it does Israel, the people, which before other peoples is Jahve's creation, viz., the creation of His miraculously mighty grace, is repeated. In the call or invitation, &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492; signifies to stretch one's self out full length upon the ground, the proper attitude of adoration; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, to curtsey, to totter; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, Arabic baraka, starting from the radical signification flectere, to kneel down, in genua (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;, pronum  equals  procnum) procumbere, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a> (cf. Hlemann, Bibelstudien, i. 135f.). Beside &#1506;&#1501; &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, people of His pasture, &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; is not the flock formed by His creating hand (Augustine: ipse gratia&#770; sua&#770; nos oves fecit), but, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>, the flock under His protection, the flock led and defended by His skilful, powerful hand. Bttcher renders: flock of His charge; but &#1497;&#1491; in this sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a>) signifies only a place, and "flock of His place" would be poetry and prose in one figure. </body></html>
