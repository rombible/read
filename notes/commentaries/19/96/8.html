His apostles and evangelists showed forth his salvation among the heathen, his wonders among all people. All the earth is here summoned to worship the Lord. We must worship him in the beauty of holiness, as God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Glorious things are said of him, both as motives to praise and matter of praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/96.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name - This also is literally taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16.htm">1 Chronicles 16</a>:<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1-13</a> :28. The margin here is, as in Hebrew, of "his name:" the honor of his name. The idea is that which is expressed in our translation. Bring to God what is due to him; or, render such an acknowledgment as he deserves and claims. Acknowledge him as God, and acknowledge him to be such a God as he is. Let the honor due to God as such be given him; and let the honor due to him, for the character which he actually has, be ascribed to him.<p>Bring an offering - This is language taken from the temple-worship, and means that God is to be worshipped, in the manner which he has prescribed, as a suitable expression of his majesty. The word here rendered "offering" - &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  mincha&#772;h - is that which is commonly used to denote a "bloodless" offering - a thank-offering. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>.<p>And come into his courts - The courts or areas around the tabernacle and the temple, where sacrifices were made, and where the people worshipped.
