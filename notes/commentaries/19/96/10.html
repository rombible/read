Make this proclamation everywhere. This is changed from the parallel passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16.htm">1 Chronicles 16</a>. The language there is, "Fear before him, all the earth; the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved: let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let people say among the nations, The Lord reigneth." The sense is, however, essentially the same. The idea here is, "Make universal proclamation that Yahweh is King."<p>That the Lord reigneth - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>.<p>The world also shall be established ... - Under the reign of God. The meaning is, that the world is fixed or immovable. It has its place, and it cannot be moved out of it. The government of God is fixed and stable. It is not temporary, changing, vacillating, like the dynasties of the earth, but is stedfast and abiding, and is well represented by the earth - so fixed and firm that nothing can move it from its place.<p>He shall judge the people righteously - The people of all lands; the nations of the earth.

This is a direction to such as were converted to Christ among the Jews, or were first called out from among the Gentiles; or to the ministers of the word, the apostles and first preachers of the Gospel more especially, who were sent into all the world to preach the Gospel to every creature, that a people from among them might he taken for the Lord: <p>that the Lord reigneth; whose Gospel should be received and obeyed, and his ordinances submitted to; who now reigns in heaven, at his Father's right hand, and must reign till all enemies are put under his feet; he reigns in the hearts of his people by his Spirit and grace; will reign more gloriously in his churches in the latter day, and with his saints for a thousand years in the New Jerusalem church state; and, after that, to all eternity in heaven: this is one part of the Gospel, or good tidings to be published among the Gentiles, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, <p>the world also shall be established, that it shall not be moved; not the natural material world; for that shall flee, and pass away, and be no more; it shall be burnt up, and all things in it; though that, and mankind on it, will be continued till all the elect of God are gathered in; Christ will uphold it, it being by his power that it shall not be moved till the work is effected: moreover, the church, in however fluctuating and unsettled a condition it may be now, sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another, yet ere long will be established on the top of the mountains, so that it shall not be moved; and the Gospel dispensation is what will remain unto the end of time, and the Gospel is an everlasting one; the ordinances of it will continue to the second coming of Christ; and he will be with his churches to the end of the world; he is reigning King of Zion; has set up a government, of which, and the peace of it, there shall be no end: during the spiritual reign of Christ, the world will be in such stable tranquillity as to have no commotions in it, nor to be moved with wars, and rumours of wars; and when the Millennium shall take place, the new heavens and new earth shall never pass away: <p>he shall judge the people righteously: he reigns over his people in a righteous manner, with a sceptre of righteousness, according to the rules of righteousness, by righteous laws and ordinances; he justifies his people with his own righteousness; he forms the new man in them, which is created in righteousness, and sets up a kingdom within them, which consists of righteousness; and he protects and defends them, and keeps them in safety from all their enemies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/96.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Say among the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> heathen <i>that</i> the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> righteously.</span><p>(g) He prophecies that the Gentiles will be partakers with the Jews of God's promise.<p>(h) He will regenerate them anew with his Spirit, and restore them to the image of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/96.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

Justin Martyr appears to be the only certain Greek authority for the addition[53]. He treats the Psalm as a prophecy of Christ’s reign after His crucifixion (<span class="ital">Apol.</span> i. 41), and in the <span class="ital">Dialogue with Trypho the Jew</span> (c. 73) he charges the Jews with having falsified the text by erasing the words <span class="ital">from the tree</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου</span>). The charge is groundless. Doubtless the words were simply a Christian gloss on the text, which had no wide currency, except through the Old Latin Version. No MSS. of the LXX contain them except the transliterated Graeco-Latin <span class="ital">Psalterium Veronense</span>, which has <span class="ital">apo xylu</span>, and cod. 156, which has the barbarism <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῷ ξύλῳ</span>.
