Our exhortations and our examples should agree together. He recommends the works of the Lord, as the proper subject, when we are praising him; and the dealings of his providence toward the world, the church, and particular persons. All the works of the Lord are spoken of as one, it is his work; so admirably do all the dispensations of his providence centre in one design. The works of God, humbly and diligently sought into, shall all be found just and holy. God's pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works, and ought to be remembered to his glory. He will ever be mindful of his covenant; he has ever been so, and he ever will be so. His works of providence were done according to the truth of the Divine promises and prophecies, and so were verity, or truth; and by him who has a right to dispose of the earth as he pleases, and so are judgment, or righteous: and this holds good of the work of grace upon the heart of man, ver. 7,8. All God's commandments are sure; all have been fulfilled by Christ, and remain with him for a rule of walk and conversation to us. He sent redemption unto his people, out of Egypt at first, and often afterwards; and these were typical of the great redemption, which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by the Lord Jesus. Here his everlasting righteousness shines forth in union with his boundless mercy. No man is wise who does not fear the Lord; no man acts wisely except as influenced by that fear. This fear will lead to repentance, to faith in Christ, to watchfulness and obedience. Such persons are of a good understanding, however poor, unlearned, or despised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/111.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath made his wonderful works - In heaven and in earth.<p>To be remembered - literally, "Memory hath he made for his wonderful works." "They" are so made, that man may remember them; the memory of man, also, is so made, that it may retain them. The highest and most appropriate exercise of memory is to retain the lessons which the works of God inculcate; to treasure up for gratitude and for use what he teaches his intelligent creation through those works. Memory can never be better employed than in treasuring up the truths which the Creator teaches in his providential dealings with us, and in his word. How much better would it be for man if he labored more to "remember" these things; if he sought to forget many of those things which he is so careful now to retain in his recollection.<p>The Lord is gracious ... - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>. This is stated here as the result of the careful study of the doings of God; as the conclusion to which all will come who carefully study his works.

All his works are marvellous ones; his works of creation, that they should rise out of nothing at a word of command; his works of providence, which have such a depth of wisdom and knowledge in them, are unsearchable and past finding out; and his works of redemption and grace; and these are so wrought by him, and such methods taken to continue the memory of them, that they cannot well be forgotten: all things in nature are as they were from the beginning; the sun, moon, and stars, keep their course and station; cold and heat, summer and winter, seedtime and harvest, are as they always were; remarkable providences have been carefully recorded, and memorials of them handed down to posterity. The deliverance of Israel out of Egypt was annually remembered in the passover; the feeding of them with manna in the wilderness was caused to be remembered by a pot of manna preserved in the tabernacle and temple; and the great work of our redemption by Christ is brought to remembrance in the ordinance of the Lord's supper, appointed for that purpose. <p>The Lord is gracious and full of compassion; so he was in eternity, and is in time; this appears in all his works, and especially in our salvation by Jesus Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/111.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/111.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">made a memorial for his wonderful works</span>, particularly the deliverance of His people from Egypt, by the continuous tradition which they were charged to hand on from one generation to another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-3.htm" title="Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.">Psalm 78:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-26.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?">Exodus 12:26</a>; &c.), and by the festivals and ordinances which commemorated that deliverance, especially the Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm" title="And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and you shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.">Exodus 12:14</a>).

The Lord, says <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>, dashes in pieces kings at the right hand of this priest-king, in the day when His wrath is kindled (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-10.htm">Psalm 21:10</a>). &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; is rightly accented as subject. The fact that the victorious work of the person addressed is not his own work, but the work of Jahve on his behalf and through him, harmonizes with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>. The sitting of the exalted one at the right hand of Jahve denotes his uniform participation in His high dignity and dominion. But in the fact that the Lord, standing at his right hand (cf. the counterpart in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>), helps him to victory, that unchangeable relationship is shown in its historical working. The right hand of the exalted one is at the same time not inactive (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a>), and the Lord does not fail him when he is obliged to use his arm against his foes. The subject to &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; and to the two &#1502;&#1495;&#1509; is the Lord as acting through him. "He shall judge among the peoples" is an eschatological hope, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>. What the result of this judgment of the peoples is, is stated by the neutrally used verb &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; with its accusative &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (cf. on the construction <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>): it there becomes full of corpses, there is there a multitude of corpses covering everything. This is the same thought as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>, and wrought out in closely related connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>. Like the first &#1502;&#1495;&#1509;, the second (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-6.htm">Psalm 110:6</a>) is also a perfect of the idea past. Accordingly &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; seems to signify the earth or a country (cf. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-35.htm">Nehemiah 9:35</a>) broad and wide, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; the great far-stretching deep. But it might also be understood the "land of Rabbah," as they say the "land of Jazer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>), the "country of Goshen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-41.htm">Joshua 10:41</a>), and the like; therefore the land of the Ammonites, whose chief city is Rabbah. It is also questionable whether &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; is to be taken like &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a> (Hormann), or whether &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1512;&#1489;&#1492; belongs to &#1502;&#1495;&#1509; as a designation of the battle-field. The parallels as to the word and the thing itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-22.htm">Psalm 68:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>., speak for &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; signifying not the chief, but the head; not, however, in a collective sense (lxx, Targum), but the head of the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>). If this is the case, and the construction &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1500; is accordingly to be given up, neither is it now to be rendered: He breaks in pieces a head upon the land of Rabbah, but upon a great (broad) land; in connection with which, however, this designation of the place of battle takes its rise from the fact that the head of the ruler over this great territory is intended, and the choice of the word may have been determined by an allusion to David's Ammonitish war. The subject of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-7.htm">Psalm 110:7</a> is now not that arch-fiend, as he who in the course of history renews his youth, that shall rise up again (as we explained it formerly), but he whom the Psalm, which is thus rounded off with unity of plan, celebrates. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-7.htm">Psalm 110:7</a> expresses the toil of his battle, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-7.htm">Psalm 110:7</a> the reward of undertaking the toil. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is therefore equivalent to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, however, although it might belong to &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500; (of the brook by the wayside, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-10.htm">Psalm 83:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>), is correctly drawn to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; by the accentuation: he shall on his arduous way, the way of his mission (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-24.htm">Psalm 102:24</a>), be satisfied with a drink from the brook. He will stand still only for a short time to refresh himself, and in order then to fight afresh; he will unceasingly pursue his work of victory without giving himself any time for rest and sojourn, and therefore (as the reward for it) it shall come to pass that he may lift his head on high as victor; and this, understood in a christological sense, harmonizes essentially with <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>. </body></html>
