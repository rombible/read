(See Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-4.htm" title="Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face ever more.">Psalm 105:4</a>.) The psalmist was no doubt thinking of historical proofs of Jehovah’s goodness to the chosen race, but his words are capable of a wide range. The best illustration of them may be found in the writings in which Mr. Ruskin warns this generation against the danger of insensibility to natural beauty.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/111.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>111:1-10 The Lord is to be praised for his works. - The psalmist resolves to praise God himself. Our exhortations and our examples should agree together. He recommends the works of the Lord, as the proper subject, when we are praising him; and the dealings of his providence toward the world, the church, and particular persons. All the works of the Lord are spoken of as one, it is his work; so admirably do all the dispensations of his providence centre in one design. The works of God, humbly and diligently sought into, shall all be found just and holy. God's pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works, and ought to be remembered to his glory. He will ever be mindful of his covenant; he has ever been so, and he ever will be so. His works of providence were done according to the truth of the Divine promises and prophecies, and so were verity, or truth; and by him who has a right to dispose of the earth as he pleases, and so are judgment, or righteous: and this holds good of the work of grace upon the heart of man, ver. 7,8. All God's commandments are sure; all have been fulfilled by Christ, and remain with him for a rule of walk and conversation to us. He sent redemption unto his people, out of Egypt at first, and often afterwards; and these were typical of the great redemption, which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by the Lord Jesus. Here his everlasting righteousness shines forth in union with his boundless mercy. No man is wise who does not fear the Lord; no man acts wisely except as influenced by that fear. This fear will lead to repentance, to faith in Christ, to watchfulness and obedience. Such persons are of a good understanding, however poor, unlearned, or despised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/111.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The works of the Lord are great - They are great in number; great in magnitude; great in wisdom; great in goodness. This language was appropriate in the time of the psalmist, when people looked upon the heavens with the naked eye alone, and when they had very imperfect views of the real magnitude of the universe as it is now disclosed by the telescope. It is entirely appropriate now, and conveys a more solemn and sublime impression than it would in the time of the psalmist. It will still be appropriate under the larger views which may yet be obtained of the universe by more perfect instruments, by more accurate observation, and by more profound study. And it will be appropriate when people shall survey the greatness of the universe from the heights of heaven.<p>Sought out of all them - Studied by all such.<p>That have pleasure therein - More literally, "Sought to all their wishes." Perhaps the meaning is, that they would find all their desires gratified in those works; they would find in them all that they would wish to find respecting the power, wisdom, goodness, and majesty of God. Still it implies that they have a desire thus to study his works, or that they do find a pleasure in examining the proofs of the being and attributes of God in his works. A man who loves God will have real pleasure in studying his works as well as his word; and it is as proper to find pleasure in the one as in the other - as proper to wish to find the knowledge which the one imparts as that which the other bestows. One great error among the friends of God is the neglect to study his works. In doing this, people need not neglect or undervalue the Bible and the knowledge which it gives, for such studies would be among the best means of illustrating the Bible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/111.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

In design, in size, in number, in excellence, all the works of the Lord are great. Even the little things of God are great. In some point of view or other each one of the productions of his power, or the deeds of his wisdom, will appear to be great to the wise in heart. "Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein." Those who love their Maker delight in his handiworks, they perceive that there is more in them than appears upon the surface, and therefore they bend their minds to study and understand them. The devout naturalist ransacks nature, the earnest student of history pries into hidden facts and dark stories, and the man of God digs into the mines of Scripture, and hoards up each grain of its golden truth. God's works are worthy of our researches, they yield us instruction and pleasure wonderfully blended, and they grow upon, appearing to be far greater, after investigation than before. Men's works are noble from a distance; God's works are great when sought out. Delitzsch reads the passage, "Worthy of being sought after in all their purposes," and this also is a grand truth, for the end and design which God hath in all that he makes or does is equally admirable with the work itself. The hidden wisdom of God is the most marvellous part of his works, and hence those who do not look below the surface miss the best part of what he would teach us. Because the works are great they cannot be seen all at once, but must be looked into with care, and this seeking out is of essential service to us by educating our faculties, and strengthening our spiritual eye gradually to bear the light of the divine glory. It is well for us that all things cannot be seen at a glance, for the search into their mysteries is as useful to us as the knowledge which we thereby attain. The history of the Lord's dealings with his people is especially a fit subject for the meditation of reverent minds who find therein a sweet solace, and a never failing source of delight.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a><p>"His work is honourable and glorious." His one special work, the salvation of his people, is here mentioned as distinguished from his many other works. This reflects honour and glory upon him. It is deservedly the theme of the highest praise, and compels those who understand it and experience it to ascribe all honour and glory unto the Lord. Its conception, its sure foundations, its gracious purpose, its wise arrangements, its gift of Jesus as Redeemer, its application of redemption by the Holy Ghost in regeneration and sanctification, and all else which make up the one glorious whole, all redound to the infinite honour of Him who contrived and carried out so astounding a method of salvation. No other work can be compared with it: it honours both the Saviour and the saved, and while it brings glory to God it also brings us to glory. There is none like the God of Jeshurun, and there is no salvation like that which he has wrought for his people. "And his righteousness endureth for ever." In the work of grace righteousness is not forgotten, nor deprived of its glory; rather, it is honoured in the eyes of the intelligent universe. The bearing of guilt by our great Substitute proved that not even to effect the purposes of his grace would the Lord forget his righteousness; no future strain upon his justice can ever be equal to that which it has already sustained in the bruising of his dear Son; it must henceforth assuredly endure for ever. Moreover, the righteousness of God in the whole plan can never now be suspected of failure, for an that it requires is already performed, its demands are satisfied by the double deed of our Lord in enduring the vengeance due, and in rendering perfect obedience to the law. Caprice does not enter into the government of the Lord, the rectitude of it is and must for ever be beyond all question. In no single deed of God can unrighteousness be found, nor shall there ever be: this is the very glory of his work, and even its adversaries cannot gainsay it. Let believers. therefore, praise him evermore, and never blush to speak of that work which is so honourable and glorious.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a><p>"He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered." He meant them to remain in the recollection of his people, and they do so: partly because they are in themselves memorable, and because also he has taken care to record them by the pen of inspiration, and has written them upon the hearts of his people by his Holy Spirit. By the ordinances of the Mosaic law, the coming out of Egypt, the sojourn in the wilderness, and other memorabilia of Israel's history were constantly brought before the minds of the people, and their children were by such means instructed in the wonders which God had wrought in old time. Deeds such as God has wrought are not to be admired for an hour and then forgotten, they are meant to be perpetual signs and instructive tokens to all coming generations; and especially are they designed to confirm the faith of his people in the divine love, and to make them know that "the Lord is gracious and full of compassion." They need not fear to trust his grace for the future, for they remember it in the past. Grace is as conspicuous as righteousness in the great work of God, yea, a fulness of tender love is seen in all that he has done. He treats his people with great consideration for their weakness and infirmity; having the same pity for them as a father hath towards his children. Should we not praise him for this? A silver thread of lovingkindness runs through the entire fabric of God's work of salvation and providence, and never once is it left out in the whole piece. Let the memories of his saints bear witness to this fact with grateful joy.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/111.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The works of the Lord; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">The works of creation</span>; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

His works of creation are great, being made out of nothing, are the effects of great power, and the produce of great wisdom, and which greatly display the glory of their Maker; the works of providence are great, which are daily wrought, especially such as concern the church and people of God, for whom he does great things, whereof they have reason to be glad and praise his name; the miracles of Christ he wrought here on earth were surprisingly great, some of them such as had not keen known from the creation of the world; and yet greater things were shown him, and done by him, particularly the work of redemption, a work which angels and men were unequal to, a work which none but the great God and our Saviour could effect, and is truly called the great salvation; the work of grace upon the heart is a great work, and requires the exceeding greatness of the divine power, and which is exerted in the beginning, carrying on, and finishing that work; and for all which the Lord is to be praised: and the rather since they are such as are <p>sought out of all them that have pleasure therein; or "sought out because of all the pleasures of them, or that are in them" (f), which comes to much the same sense: there is a pleasure in the contemplation of the works of nature and providence; to behold the power, wisdom, and goodness of God in them, and his care over all his creatures; and particularly how he makes all things to work together for the good of his people; and especially it is delightful to observe the works of grace, how the glory of all the divine perfections is displayed in them; angels themselves take pleasure in looking into them: now these are sought and found out by those who delight in them; the works of creation are to be sought and found in the book of nature, the works of providence in the book of experience, and the works of grace in the book of God; and indeed all of them are recorded there, which are searched with pleasure by those that are inquisitive after them. <p>(f)  "ob omnes amabilitates eorum", Cocceius; "secundum omnia desideria eorum", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/111.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The works of the LORD <i>are</i> <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</span><p>(b) He shows that God's works are a sufficient reason for us to praise him, but chiefly his benefits toward his Church.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/111.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.

In accordance with this union of the thoughts which <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a> anticipates, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; signifies in the day of thy arriere ban, i.e., when thou callest up thy "power of an army" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-13.htm">2 Chronicles 26:13</a>) to muster and go forth to battle. In this day are the people of the king willingnesses (&#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1514;), i.e., entirely cheerful readiness; ready for any sacrifices, they bring themselves with all that they are and have to meet him. There is no need of any compulsory, lengthy proclamation calling them out: it is no army of mercenaries, but willingly and quickly they present themselves from inward impulse (&#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-2.htm">Judges 5:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-9.htm">Judges 5:9</a>). The punctuation, which makes the principal caesura at &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; with Olewejored, makes the parallelism of &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; and &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1498; distinctly prominent. Just as the former does not signify roboris tui, so now too the latter does not, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a>, signify &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (Aquila), and not, as Hofmann interprets, the dew-like freshness of youthful vigour, which the morning of the great day sheds over the king. Just as &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; signifies both exile and the exiled ones, so &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, like &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, juventus, juventa, signifies both the time and age of youth, youthfulness, and youthful, young men (the youth). Moreover one does not, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>, look for any further declaration concerning the nature of the king, but of his people who place themselves at his service. The young men are likened to dew which gently descends upon the king out of the womb (uterus) of the morning-red.<p>(Note: The lxx renders it: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (belonging to the preceding clause), &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5; (Psalt. Veron. exegennesa se; Bamberg. gegennica se). The Vulgate, following the Italic closely: in splendoribus sanctorum; ex utero ante luciferum genui te. The Fathers in some cases interpret it of the birth of the Lord at Christmas, but most of them of His antemundane birth, and accordingly Apollinaris paraphrases: &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;. In his own independent translation Jerome reads &#1489;&#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-1.htm">Psalm 87:1</a>), in montibus sanctis quasi de vulva orietur tibi ros adolescentiae tuae, as Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, - elsewhere, however, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. The substitution is not unmeaning, since the ideas of dew and of mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>) are easily united; but it was more important to give prominence to the holiness of the equipment than to that of the place of meeting.)<p>&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; is related to &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; just as &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;; the notion of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; appears to be more sharply defined, and as it were apprehended more massively, in &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;. The host of young men is likened to the dew both on account of its vigorousness and its multitude, which are like the freshness of the mountain dew and the immense number of its drops, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-12.htm">2 Samuel 17:12</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>), and on account of the silent concealment out of which it wondrously and suddenly comes to light, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a>. After not having understood "thy youth" of the youthfulness of the king, we shall now also not, with Hofmann, refer &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; to the king, the holy attire of his armour. &#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1514; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is the vestment of the priest for performing divine service: the Levite singers went forth before the army in "holy attire" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21</a>; here, however, the people without distinction wear holy festive garments. Thus they surround the divine king as dew that is born out of the womb of the morning-red. It is a priestly people which he leads forth to holy battle, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a> heavenly armies follow the Logos of God upon white horses, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; - a new generation, wonderful as if born out of heavenly light, numerous, fresh, and vigorous like the dew-drops, the offspring of the dawn. The thought that it is a priestly people leads over to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>. The king who leads this priestly people is, as we hear in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, himself a priest (cohen). As has been shown by Hupfeld and Fleischer, the priest is so called as one who stands (from &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; in an intransitive signification), viz., before God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>), like &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; the spokesman, viz., of God.<p>(Note: The Arabic lexicographers explain Arab. ka&#770;hin by mn yqu&#770;m b-'mr 'l-rjl w-ys&#8219;a&#770; f&#305;&#770; h&#803;a&#770;jth, "he who stands and does any one's business and managest his affair." That Arab. qa&#770;m, &#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, and Arab. mt&#817;l, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, side by side with &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; are synonyms of &#1489;&#1492;&#1503; in this sense of standing ready for service and in an official capacity.)<p>To stand before God is the same as to serve Him, viz., as priest. The ruler whom the Psalm celebrates is a priest who intervenes in the reciprocal dealings between God and His people within the province of divine worship the priestly character of the people who suffer themselves to be led forth to battle and victory by him, stands in causal connection with the priestly character of this their king. He is a priest by virtue of the promise of God confirmed by an oath. The oath is not merely a pledge of the fulfilment of the promise, but also a seal of the high significance of its purport. God the absolutely truthful One (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-19.htm">Numbers 13:19</a>) swears - this is the highest enhancement of the &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1492; of which prophecy is capable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>).<p>He appoints the person addressed as a priest for ever "after the manner of Melchizedek" in this most solemn manner. The i of &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; is the same ancient connecting vowel as in the &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497; of the name Melchizedek; and it has the tone, which it loses when, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>, a tone-syllable follows. The wide-meaning &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;, "in respect to, on account of," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>, is here specialized to the signification "after the manner, measure of," lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. The priesthood is to be united with the kingship in him who rules out of Zion, just as it was in Melchizedek, king of Salem, and that for ever. According to De Wette, Ewald, and Hofmann, it is not any special priesthood that is meant here, but that which was bestowed directly with the kingship, consisting in the fact that the king of Israel, by reason of his office, commended his people in prayer to God and blessed them in the name of God, and also had the ordering of Jahve's sanctuary and service. Now it is true all Israel is a "kingdom of priests" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>), and the kingly vocation in Israel must therefore also be regarded as in its way a priestly vocation. Btu this spiritual priesthood, and, if one will, this princely oversight of sacred things, needed not to come to David first of all by solemn promise; and that of Melchizedek, after which the relationship is here defined, is incongruous to him; for the king of Salem was, according to Canaanitish custom, which admitted of the union of the kingship and priesthood, really a high priest, and therefore, regarded from an Israelitish point of view, united in his own person the offices of David and of Aaron. How could David be called a priest after the manner of Melchizedek, he who had no claim upon the tithes of priests like Melchizedek, and to whom was denied the authority to offer sacrifice <p>(Note: G. Enjedin the Socinian (died 1597) accordingly, in referring this Psalm to David, started from the assumption that priestly functions have been granted exceptionally by God to this king as to no other, vid., the literature of the controversy to which this gave rise in Serpilius, Personalia Davidis, S. 268-274.)<p>inseparable from the idea of the priesthood in the Old Testament? (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>). If David were the person addressed, the declaration would stand in antagonism with the right of Melchizedek as priest recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, which, according to the indisputable representation of the Epistle to the Hebrews, was equal in compass to the Levitico-Aaronic right, and, since "after the manner of" requires a coincident reciprocal relation, in antagonism to itself also.<p>(Note: Just so Kurtz, Zur Theologie der Psalmen, loc. cit. S. 523.)<p>One might get on more easily with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> by referring the Psalm to one of the Maccabaean priest-princes (Hitzig, von Lengerke, and Olshausen); and we should then prefer to the reference to Jonathan who put on the holy stola, 1 Macc. 10:21 (so Hitzig formerly), or Alexander Jannaeus who actually bore the title king (so Hitzig now), the reference to Simon, whom the people appointed to "be their governor and high priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet" (1 Macc. 14:41), after the death of Jonathan his brother - a union of the two offices which, although an irregularity, was not one, however, that was absolutely illegal. But he priesthood, which the Maccabaeans, however, possessed originally as being priests born, is promised to the person addressed here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; and even supposing that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> the emphasis lay not on a union of the priesthood with the kingship, but of the kingship with the priesthood, then the retrospective reference to it in Zechariah forbids our removing the Psalm to a so much later period. Why should we not rather be guided in our understanding of this divine utterance, which is unique in the Old Testament, by this prophet, whose prophecy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>. is the key to it? Zechariah removes the fulfilment of the Psalm out of the Old Testament present, with its blunt separation between the monarchical and hierarchical dignity, into the domain of the future, and refers it to Jahve's Branch (&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;) that is to come. He, who will build the true temple of God, satisfactorily unites in his one person the priestly with the kingly office, which were at that time assigned to Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the prince. Thus this Psalm was understood by the later prophecy; and in what other sense could the post-Davidic church have appropriated it as a prayer and hymn, than in the eschatological Messianic sense? but this sense is also verified as the original. David here hears that the king of the future exalted at the right hand of God, and whom he calls his Lord, is at the same time an eternal priest. And because he is both these his battle itself is a priestly royal work, and just on this account his people fighting with him also wear priestly garments. </body></html>
