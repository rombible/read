They are identical in number of verses and in structure, both being acrostic, that is to say, the first clause of each commences with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the second clause with the second, and so on. The general idea that runs through them is the likeness of the godly man to God. That resemblance comes very markedly to the surface at several points in the psalms, and pervades them traceably even where it is less conspicuous. The two corresponding clauses which I have read as my text are the first salient instances of it. But I propose to deal not only with them, but with a couple of others which occur in the course of the psalms, and will appear as I proceed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The general underlying thought is a noteworthy one. The worshipper is to be like his God. So it is in idolatry; so it should be with us. Worship is, or should be, adoration of and yearning after the highest conceivable good. Such an attitude must necessarily lead to imitation, and be crowned by resemblance. Love makes like, and they who worship God are bound to, and certainly will, in proportion to the ardour and sincerity of their devotion, grow like Him whom they adore. So I desire to look with you at the instances of this resemblance or parallelism which the Psalmist emphasises.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The first of them is that in the clauses which I have read as our starting-point, viz. God and the godly are alike in enduring righteousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>That seems a bold thing to say, especially when we remember how lofty and transcendent were the Old Testament conceptions of the righteousness of God. But, lofty as these were, this Psalmist lifts an unpresumptuous eye to the heavens, and having said of Him who dwells there, ‘His righteousness endureth for ever,’ is not afraid to turn to the humble worshipper on this low earth, and declare the same thing of him. Our finite, frail, feeble lives may be really conformed to the image of the heavenly. The dewdrop with its little rainbow has a miniature of the great arch that spans the earth and rises into the high heavens. And so, though there are differences, deep and impassable, between anything that can be called creatural righteousness, and that which bears the same name in the heavens, the fact that it does bear the same name is a guarantee to us that there is an essential resemblance between the righteousness of God in its lustrous perfectness, and the righteousness of His child in its imperfect effort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But how can we venture to run any kind of parallelism between the eternity of the one and that of the other? God’s righteousness we can understand as enduring for ever, because it is inseparable from His very being; because it is manifested unbrokenly in all the works that for ever pour out from that central Source, and because it and its doings stand fast and unshaken amidst the passage of ages, and the ‘wreck of matter and the crash of worlds.’ But may there not be, if not an eternity, yet a perpetuity, in our reflection of the divine righteousness which shall serve to vindicate the application of the same mighty word to both? Is it not possible that, unbroken amidst the stress of temptation, and running on without interruptions, there may be in our hearts and in our lives conformity to the divine will? And is it not possible that the transiencies of our earthly doings may be sublimed into perpetuity if there is in them the preserving salt of righteousness?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘The actions of the just<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Smell sweet, and blossom in the dust.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>And may it not be, too, that though this Psalmist may have had no clear articulate doctrine of eternal life beyond, he may have felt, and rightly felt, that there were things that were too fair to die, and that it was inconceivable that a soul which had been, in some measure, tinged with the righteousness of God could ever be altogether a prey to the law of transiency and decay which seizes upon things material and corporeal? That which is righteous is eternal, be it manifested in the acts of the unchanging God or in the acts of a dying man, and when all else has passed away, and the elements have melted with fervent heat, ‘he that doeth the will of God,’ and the deeds which did it, ‘shall abide for ever.’ ‘His righteousness endureth for ever.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now, brethren! there are two ways in which we may look at this parallelism of our text: the one is as containing a stringent requirement; the other as holding forth a mighty hope. It contains a stringent requirement. Our religion does not consist in assenting to any creed. Our religion is not wholly to consist of devout emotions and loving and joyous acts of communion and friendship with God. There must be more than these; these things there must be. For if a man is to be guided mainly by reason, there must, first of all, be creed; then there must be corresponding emotions. But creed and emotions are both meant to be forces which shall drive the wheels of life, and conduct is, after all, the crown of religion and the test of godliness. They that hold communion with God are bound to mould their lives into the likeness of His. ‘Little children, let no man deceive you,’ and let not your own hearts deceive you. You are not a Christian because you believe the truths of the Gospel. You are not such a Christian as you ought to be, if your religion is more manifest in loving trust than in practical obedience which comes from trust. ‘He that doeth righteousness is righteous,’ and he is to be righteous ‘even as He is righteous.’ If you are God’s, you will be like God. Apply the touchstone to your lives, and test your Christianity by this simple and most stringent test.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But again, we may look at the thought as holding forth a great hope. I do not wish to force upon Old Testament writers New Testament truth. It would be an anachronism and an absurdity to make this Psalmist responsible for anything like a clear evangelistic statement of the way by which a man may be made righteous. That waited for coming days, and eminently for Jesus Christ. But it would be quite as great a mistake to eviscerate the words of their plain implications. And when they put side by side the light and the reflection, God and the godly, it seems to me to be doing violence to their meaning for the sake of trying to make them mean less than they do, if we refuse to recognise that they have at any rate an inkling of the thought that the Original and Pattern of human righteousness was likewise the Source of it. This at least is plain, that the Psalmist thought that ‘the fear of the Lord’ was not only, as he calls it at the close of the former of the two psalms, ‘the beginning of wisdom,’ but also the basis of goodness, for he begins his description of the godly with it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I believe that he felt, what is assuredly true, that no man, by his own unaided effort, can ever work out for himself a righteousness which will satisfy his own conscience, and that he must, first of all, be in touch with God, in order to receive from Him that which he cannot create. Ah, brethren! the ‘fine linen, clean and white, which is the righteousness of saints,’ is woven in no earthly looms; and the lustrous light with which it glistens is such as ‘no fuller on earth can white’ men’s characters into. Another Psalmist has sung of the man who can stand in the holy place, ‘He shall <span class="ital">receive</span> the blessing from the Lord, even righteousness from the God of his salvation,’ and our psalms hint, if they do not articulately declare, how that reception is possible for us, when they set forth waiting upon God as the condition of being made like Him. We translate the Psalmist’s feeling after the higher truth which we know, when we desire ‘that we may be found in Him, not having our own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is of God by faith.’ So much, then, for the first point of correspondence in these two psalms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. God and the godly are alike in gracious compassion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>If you will turn to the two psalms for a moment, and look at the last clauses of the two fourth verses, you will see how that thought is brought out. In the former psalm we read, ‘The Lord is gracious and full of compassion’: in the latter we find, ‘he’ {the upright man} ‘is gracious and full of compassion, and righteous.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I need not trouble you with any remarks about certain difficulties that lie in the rendering of that latter verse. Suffice it to say that they are such as to make more emphatic the intentional resemblance between the godly as there described, and God as described in the previous one. Of both it is said ‘gracious and full of compassion.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now that great truth of which I have been speaking, the divine righteousness, is like white Alpine snow, sublime, but cold, awful and repellent, when taken by itself. Our hearts need something more than a righteous God if we are ever to worship and draw near. Just as the white snow on the high peak needs to be flushed with the roseate hue of the morning before it can become tender, and create longings, so the righteousness of the great white Throne has to be tinged with the ruddy heart-hue of gracious compassion if men are to be moved to adore and to love. Each enhances the other. ‘What God hath joined together,’ in Himself, ‘let not man put asunder’; nor talk about the stern Deity of the Old Testament, and pit Him against the compassionate Father of the New. He is righteous, but the proclaimers of His righteousness in old days never forgot to blend with the righteousness the mercy; and the combination heightens the lustre of both attributes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The same combination is absolutely needful in the copy, as is emphatically set forth in our text by the addition of ‘and righteous,’ in the case of the man. For whilst with God the tyro attributes do lie, side by side, in perfect harmony, in us men there is always danger that the one shall trench upon the territory of the other, and that he who has cultivated the habit of looking upon sorrows and sins with compassion and tenderness shall somewhat lose the power of looking at them with righteousness. So our text, in regard to man, proclaims more emphatically than it needs to do in regard to the perfect God, that ever his highest beauty of compassion must be wedded to righteousness, and ever his truest strength of righteousness must be softened with compassion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But beyond that, note how, wherever there is the loving and childlike contemplation of God, there will be an analogy in our compassion, to His perfectness. We are transformed by beholding. The sun strikes a poor little pane of glass in a cottage miles away, and it flashes with some likeness of the sun and casts a light across the plain. The man whose face is turned Godwards will have beauty pass into his face, and all that look upon him will see ‘as it had been the countenance of an angel.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If we have, in any real and deep measure, received mercy we shall reflect mercy. Remember the parable of the unmerciful debtor. The servant that cast himself at his lord’s feet, and got the acquittal of his debt, and went out and gripped his fellow-servant by the throat, leaving the marks of his fingernails on his windpipe, with his ‘Pay me that thou owest!’ had all the pardon cancelled, and all the debt laid upon his shoulders again. If we owe all our hope and peace to a forgiving God, how can we make anything else the law of our lives than that, having received mercy, we should show mercy? The test of your being a forgiven man is your forgivingness. There is no getting away from that plain principle, which modifies the declaration of the freedom of God’s full pardon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But I would have you notice, further, as a very remarkable illustration of this correspondence between the gracious and compassionate Lord and His servant, that in the verses which follow respectively the two about which I am now speaking, the same idea is wrought out in another shape. In the psalm dealing with the divine character and works we read, immediately after the declaration that He is ‘gracious and full of compassion,’ this-’He hath given meat to them that fear Him’; and the corresponding clause in the second of our psalms is followed by this-to translate accurately-’It is well with the man who showeth favour and lendeth.’ So man’s open-handedness in regard to money is put down side by side with God’s open-handedness in regard to giving meat unto them that fear Him. And again, in the ninth verse of each psalm, we have the same thought set forth in another fashion. ‘He sent redemption unto His people,’ says the one; ‘He hath dispersed, He hath given to the poor,’ says the other. That is to say, our paltry giving may be paralleled with the unspeakable gifts which God has bestowed, if they come from a love which is like His. It does not matter though they are so small and His are so great; there is a resemblance. The tiniest crystal may be like the hugest. God gives to us the possession of things in order that we may enjoy the luxury, which is one of the elements in the blessedness of the blessed God, who is blessed because He is the giving God, the luxury of giving. Poor though our bestowments must be, they are not unlike His. The little burn amongst the heather carves its tiny bed, and impels its baby ripples by the same laws which roll the waters of the Amazon, and every fall that it makes over a shelf of rock a foot high is a miniature Niagara.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. So, lastly, we have still another point, not so much of resemblance as of correspondence, in the firmness of God’s utterances and of the godly heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>In the first of our two psalms we read, in the seventh verse, ‘All His commandments are <span class="ital">sure</span>.’ In the second we read, in the corresponding verse, ‘his heart is <span class="ital">fixed</span>, trusting in the Lord.’ The former psalm goes on, ‘His commandments <span class="ital">stand fast</span> for ever and ever; and the next psalm, in the corresponding verse, says ‘his heart is <span class="ital">established</span>,’ the original employing the same word in both cases, which in our version is rendered, in the one place, ‘stand fast,’ and in the other ‘established.’ So that the Psalmist is thinking of a correspondence between the stability of God’s utterances and the stability of the heart that clasps them in faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> His commandments are not only precepts which enjoin duty. All which God says is law, whether it be directly in the nature of guiding precept, or whether it be in the nature of revealing truth, or whether it be in the nature of promise. It is sure, reliable, utterly trustworthy. We may be certain that it will direct us aright, that it will reveal to us absolute truth, that it will hold forth no flattering and false promises. And it is ‘established.’ The one fixed point amidst the whirl of things is the uttered will of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Therefore, the heart that builds there builds safely. And there should be a correspondence, whether there is or no, between the faithfulness of the Speaker and the faith of the hearer. A man who is doubtful about the solidity of the parapet which keeps him from toppling over into the abyss will lean gingerly upon it, until he has found out that it is firm. The man that knows how strong is the stay on which he rests ought to lean hard upon it. Lean hard upon God, put all your weight upon Him. You cannot put too much, you cannot lean too hard. The harder the better; the better He is pleased, and the more He breathes support and strength into us. And, brethren! if thus we build an established faith on that sure foundation, and match the unchangeableness of God in Christ with the constancy of our faith in Him, then, ‘He that believeth shall never make haste,’ and as my psalm says, ‘He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The upshot of the whole matter is-we cannot work out for ourselves a righteousness that will satisfy our own consciences, nor secure for ourselves a strength that will give peace to our hearts, and stability to our lives, by any other means than by cleaving fast to God revealed in Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have borne the image of the earthly long enough; let us open our hearts to God in Christ. Let us yield ourselves to Him; let us gaze upon Him with fixed eyes of love, and labour to make our own what He bestows upon us. Thus living near Him, we shall be bathed in His light, and show forth something of His beauty. Godliness is God-likeness. It is of no use to say that we are God’s children if we have none of the family likeness. ‘If ye were Abraham’s sons ye would do the works of Abraham,’ said Christ to the Jews. If we are God’s sons we shall do the works of God. ‘Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect;’ be ye merciful as your Father is merciful. And if thus we here, dwelling with Christ, are being conformed to the image of His Son, we shall one day ‘be satisfied’ when we ‘awake in His likeness.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/111.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/111-3.htm" title="His work is honorable and glorious: and his righteousness endures for ever....">Psalm 111:3-4</a>. </span><span class="ital">His work — </span>Either all his works, or that eminent branch of them, his providence toward his people, as is expressed afterward; <span class="ital">is honourable and glorious — </span>Becoming the Divine Majesty, and bringing glory to him from all that observe and consider it. <span class="ital">And his righteousness — </span>His justice or faithfulness in performing his word; <span class="ital">endureth for ever —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hath always been, and will still be, evident to his people in all generations, and in all conditions, even when he afflicts them, and seems to deal most severely, and to break his promise with them. <span class="ital">He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered — </span>Either, 1st, By those memorials which he hath left of them in his word; or, rather, 2d, By their own wonderful nature, and their lasting effects, and the benefits flowing from them, which are such as cannot easily be forgotten. <span class="ital">The Lord is full of compassion — </span>Toward his people, as appears from his works and conduct toward us, in sparing, pardoning, restoring, and preserving us, when we deserved to be utterly destroyed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/111.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>111:1-10 The Lord is to be praised for his works. - The psalmist resolves to praise God himself. Our exhortations and our examples should agree together. He recommends the works of the Lord, as the proper subject, when we are praising him; and the dealings of his providence toward the world, the church, and particular persons. All the works of the Lord are spoken of as one, it is his work; so admirably do all the dispensations of his providence centre in one design. The works of God, humbly and diligently sought into, shall all be found just and holy. God's pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works, and ought to be remembered to his glory. He will ever be mindful of his covenant; he has ever been so, and he ever will be so. His works of providence were done according to the truth of the Divine promises and prophecies, and so were verity, or truth; and by him who has a right to dispose of the earth as he pleases, and so are judgment, or righteous: and this holds good of the work of grace upon the heart of man, ver. 7,8. All God's commandments are sure; all have been fulfilled by Christ, and remain with him for a rule of walk and conversation to us. He sent redemption unto his people, out of Egypt at first, and often afterwards; and these were typical of the great redemption, which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by the Lord Jesus. Here his everlasting righteousness shines forth in union with his boundless mercy. No man is wise who does not fear the Lord; no man acts wisely except as influenced by that fear. This fear will lead to repentance, to faith in Christ, to watchfulness and obedience. Such persons are of a good understanding, however poor, unlearned, or despised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/111.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His work is honorable and glorious - literally, "Honour and glory is his work;" that is, All that he does is honorable and glorious. The language would cover all that God does in the works of creation, providence, and redemption. There is honor - there is majesty - in "everything" that he does.<p>And his righteousness endureth for ever - That is, It will be found in all the investigations of his works, that he is unchangeably righteous or just. All that he has done, or that he now does, goes to demonstrate this. There are doings of people - even of good people - which will not bear investigation; but there are no such acts of God. There are things that people do which excite admiration only when there is no investigation in regard to them; but the works of God are admired the more, the more they are studied. There are things which appear beautiful, or appear sweet only when they are not shaken; a collection of perfumes will give out sweets the more it is stirred. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/111.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4. honourable and glorious&#8212;literally, "honor and majesty," which illustrate His glorious perfections.<p>righteousness&#8212;(Ps 7:17; 31:1), which He has made memorable by wonders of love and mercy, in supplying the wants of His people according to covenant engagements.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/111.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His work; </span> either all his works, of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-2.htm" title="The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.">Psalm 111:2</a>"</span>; or that eminent branch of those works, his providence towards his people, as it is expressed afterwards <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Honourable and glorious; </span> becoming the Divine Majesty, and bringing glory to him from all that observe and consider it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His righteousness; </span> his justice or faithfulness in performing his word. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Endureth for ever; </span> hath always been, and will still be, evident to his people in all generations, and in all conditions, even when he afflicts them, and seems to deal most severely, and to break his promise with them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/111.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>His work is honourable and glorious,....

In this day are the people of the king willingnesses (&#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1514;), i.e., entirely cheerful readiness; ready for any sacrifices, they bring themselves with all that they are and have to meet him. There is no need of any compulsory, lengthy proclamation calling them out: it is no army of mercenaries, but willingly and quickly they present themselves from inward impulse (&#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-2.htm">Judges 5:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-9.htm">Judges 5:9</a>). The punctuation, which makes the principal caesura at &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; with Olewejored, makes the parallelism of &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; and &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1498; distinctly prominent. Just as the former does not signify roboris tui, so now too the latter does not, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a>, signify &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (Aquila), and not, as Hofmann interprets, the dew-like freshness of youthful vigour, which the morning of the great day sheds over the king.

Moreover one does not, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>, look for any further declaration concerning the nature of the king, but of his people who place themselves at his service. The young men are likened to dew which gently descends upon the king out of the womb (uterus) of the morning-red.<p>(Note: The lxx renders it: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (belonging to the preceding clause), &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5; (Psalt.

The Fathers in some cases interpret it of the birth of the Lord at Christmas, but most of them of His antemundane birth, and accordingly Apollinaris paraphrases: &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;. In his own independent translation Jerome reads &#1489;&#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-1.htm">Psalm 87:1</a>), in montibus sanctis quasi de vulva orietur tibi ros adolescentiae tuae, as Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, - elsewhere, however, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. The substitution is not unmeaning, since the ideas of dew and of mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>) are easily united; but it was more important to give prominence to the holiness of the equipment than to that of the place of meeting.)<p>&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; is related to &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; just as &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is to &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;; the notion of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; appears to be more sharply defined, and as it were apprehended more massively, in &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;. The host of young men is likened to the dew both on account of its vigorousness and its multitude, which are like the freshness of the mountain dew and the immense number of its drops, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-12.htm">2 Samuel 17:12</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>), and on account of the silent concealment out of which it wondrously and suddenly comes to light, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7</a>. After not having understood "thy youth" of the youthfulness of the king, we shall now also not, with Hofmann, refer &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; to the king, the holy attire of his armour. &#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1514; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is the vestment of the priest for performing divine service: the Levite singers went forth before the army in "holy attire" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21</a>; here, however, the people without distinction wear holy festive garments. Thus they surround the divine king as dew that is born out of the womb of the morning-red. It is a priestly people which he leads forth to holy battle, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a> heavenly armies follow the Logos of God upon white horses, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; - a new generation, wonderful as if born out of heavenly light, numerous, fresh, and vigorous like the dew-drops, the offspring of the dawn. The thought that it is a priestly people leads over to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>. The king who leads this priestly people is, as we hear in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, himself a priest (cohen). As has been shown by Hupfeld and Fleischer, the priest is so called as one who stands (from &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; in an intransitive signification), viz., before God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>), like &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; the spokesman, viz., of God.<p>(Note: The Arabic lexicographers explain Arab. ka&#770;hin by mn yqu&#770;m b-'mr 'l-rjl w-ys&#8219;a&#770; f&#305;&#770; h&#803;a&#770;jth, "he who stands and does any one's business and managest his affair." That Arab. qa&#770;m, &#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, and Arab. mt&#817;l, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, side by side with &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; are synonyms of &#1489;&#1492;&#1503; in this sense of standing ready for service and in an official capacity.)<p>To stand before God is the same as to serve Him, viz., as priest. The ruler whom the Psalm celebrates is a priest who intervenes in the reciprocal dealings between God and His people within the province of divine worship the priestly character of the people who suffer themselves to be led forth to battle and victory by him, stands in causal connection with the priestly character of this their king. He is a priest by virtue of the promise of God confirmed by an oath. The oath is not merely a pledge of the fulfilment of the promise, but also a seal of the high significance of its purport. God the absolutely truthful One (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-19.htm">Numbers 13:19</a>) swears - this is the highest enhancement of the &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1492; of which prophecy is capable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>).<p>He appoints the person addressed as a priest for ever "after the manner of Melchizedek" in this most solemn manner. The i of &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; is the same ancient connecting vowel as in the &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497; of the name Melchizedek; and it has the tone, which it loses when, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>, a tone-syllable follows. The wide-meaning &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;, "in respect to, on account of," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>, is here specialized to the signification "after the manner, measure of," lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. The priesthood is to be united with the kingship in him who rules out of Zion, just as it was in Melchizedek, king of Salem, and that for ever. According to De Wette, Ewald, and Hofmann, it is not any special priesthood that is meant here, but that which was bestowed directly with the kingship, consisting in the fact that the king of Israel, by reason of his office, commended his people in prayer to God and blessed them in the name of God, and also had the ordering of Jahve's sanctuary and service. Now it is true all Israel is a "kingdom of priests" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>), and the kingly vocation in Israel must therefore also be regarded as in its way a priestly vocation. Btu this spiritual priesthood, and, if one will, this princely oversight of sacred things, needed not to come to David first of all by solemn promise; and that of Melchizedek, after which the relationship is here defined, is incongruous to him; for the king of Salem was, according to Canaanitish custom, which admitted of the union of the kingship and priesthood, really a high priest, and therefore, regarded from an Israelitish point of view, united in his own person the offices of David and of Aaron. How could David be called a priest after the manner of Melchizedek, he who had no claim upon the tithes of priests like Melchizedek, and to whom was denied the authority to offer sacrifice <p>(Note: G. Enjedin the Socinian (died 1597) accordingly, in referring this Psalm to David, started from the assumption that priestly functions have been granted exceptionally by God to this king as to no other, vid., the literature of the controversy to which this gave rise in Serpilius, Personalia Davidis, S. 268-274.)<p>inseparable from the idea of the priesthood in the Old Testament? (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>). If David were the person addressed, the declaration would stand in antagonism with the right of Melchizedek as priest recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, which, according to the indisputable representation of the Epistle to the Hebrews, was equal in compass to the Levitico-Aaronic right, and, since "after the manner of" requires a coincident reciprocal relation, in antagonism to itself also.<p>(Note: Just so Kurtz, Zur Theologie der Psalmen, loc. cit. S. 523.)<p>One might get on more easily with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> by referring the Psalm to one of the Maccabaean priest-princes (Hitzig, von Lengerke, and Olshausen); and we should then prefer to the reference to Jonathan who put on the holy stola, 1 Macc. 10:21 (so Hitzig formerly), or Alexander Jannaeus who actually bore the title king (so Hitzig now), the reference to Simon, whom the people appointed to "be their governor and high priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet" (1 Macc. 14:41), after the death of Jonathan his brother - a union of the two offices which, although an irregularity, was not one, however, that was absolutely illegal. But he priesthood, which the Maccabaeans, however, possessed originally as being priests born, is promised to the person addressed here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; and even supposing that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> the emphasis lay not on a union of the priesthood with the kingship, but of the kingship with the priesthood, then the retrospective reference to it in Zechariah forbids our removing the Psalm to a so much later period. Why should we not rather be guided in our understanding of this divine utterance, which is unique in the Old Testament, by this prophet, whose prophecy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>. is the key to it? Zechariah removes the fulfilment of the Psalm out of the Old Testament present, with its blunt separation between the monarchical and hierarchical dignity, into the domain of the future, and refers it to Jahve's Branch (&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;) that is to come. He, who will build the true temple of God, satisfactorily unites in his one person the priestly with the kingly office, which were at that time assigned to Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the prince. Thus this Psalm was understood by the later prophecy; and in what other sense could the post-Davidic church have appropriated it as a prayer and hymn, than in the eschatological Messianic sense? but this sense is also verified as the original. David here hears that the king of the future exalted at the right hand of God, and whom he calls his Lord, is at the same time an eternal priest. And because he is both these his battle itself is a priestly royal work, and just on this account his people fighting with him also wear priestly garments. </body></html>
