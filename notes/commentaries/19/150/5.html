Praise God for his sanctuary, and the privileges we enjoy by having it among us; praise him because of his power and glory in the firmament. Those who praise the Lord in heaven, behold displays of his power and glory which we cannot now conceive. But the greatest of all his mighty acts is known in his earthly sanctuary. The holiness and the love of our God are more displayed in man's redemption, than in all his other works. Let us praise our God and Saviour for it. We need not care to know what instruments of music are mentioned. Hereby is meant that in serving God we should spare no cost or pains. Praise God with strong faith; praise him with holy love and delight; praise him with entire confidence in Christ; praise him with believing triumph over the powers of darkness; praise him by universal respect to all his commands; praise him by cheerful submission to all his disposals; praise him by rejoicing in his love, and comforting ourselves in his goodness; praise him by promoting the interests of the kingdom of his grace; praise him by lively hope and expectation of the kingdom of his glory. Since we must shortly breathe our last, while we have breath let us praise the Lord; then we shall breathe our last with comfort. Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. Such is the very suitable end of a book inspired by the Spirit of God, written for the work of praise; a book which has supplied the songs of the church for more than three thousand years; a book which is quoted more frequently than any other by Christ and his apostles; a book which presents the loftiest ideas of God and his government, which is fitted to every state of human life, which sets forth every state of religious experience, and which bears simple and clear marks of its Divine origin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/150.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praise him upon the loud cymbals - literally, "the cymbals of sound" or hearing. That is, Let there be audibly expressed joy. The allusion here is to an instrument of music that was most distinctly heard in union with other instruments. The sound of the cymbal would be most clearly audible in its accompaniment of the other instruments referred to, as the sound of cymbals, or as the "triangle" would be now. The Hebrew word rendered cymbal means a tinkling, clanging, ringing, as of metal, or of arms; then, a whirring, as of wings (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1</a>); then, any tinkling or clanging instrument, as a fish-spear or harpoon; then, cymbals, instruments of music. The cymbal, as now used, is an instrument of brass, in a circular form, like a dish, producing, when two are struck gether, a sharp, ringing sound - Webster. An instrument of this kind is evidently referred to here. The word occurs in the Bible in the following places only: <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-42.htm">Deuteronomy 28:42</a>, rendered locust; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>, rendered, as here, cymbal; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7</a>, rendered fish-spears; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1</a>, rendered shadowing with.<p>Praise him upon the high-sounding cymbals - The cymbals of joyful voice. On the word teruah, rendered high, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-16.htm">Psalm 89:16</a>. A loud, lofty sound or shout, as on the reception of a conqueror, is the idea here; and the sense is, that the praise of God was to be celebrated with that which would in the highest sense express joy and triumph. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/150.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. cymbals&#8212;suited to loud praise (Ne 12:27).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/150.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/150.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Praise him upon the loud cymbals,....

Now these several instruments of music are named, not as to be used in Gospel times; but, being expressive of the highest praise and joy shown in former times, are mentioned to set forth the highest strains and notes of praise in New Testament saints; as well as to denote their heartiness, agreement, and unanimity in this service, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>. <p>(x)  "in cymbalis auditus", Montanus, Vatablus.

"We can hardly," says Professor Cheyne, "venture to distinguish two kinds of cymbals on the ground of these two epithet" The mention of "cymbals" is reserved to the last, as being the instrument of music most expressive of joy and jubilation.

The people of the present have again, in their God, attained to a lofty self-consciousness, the consciousness of their destiny, viz., to subjugate the whole world of nations to the God of Israel. In the presence of the re-exaltation which they have experienced their throat is full of words and songs exalting Jahve (&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, plural of &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, or, according to another reading, &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1-13</a> :17), and as servants of this God, the rightful Lord of all the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-8.htm">Psalm 82:8</a>), they hold in their hand a many-mouthed, i.e., many edged sword (vid., supra, p. 580), in order to take the field on behalf of the true religion, as the Maccabees actually did, not long after: &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (2 Macc. 15:27). The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-9.htm">Psalm 149:9</a> becomes a different one, according as we take this line as co-ordinate or subordinate to what goes before. Subordinated, it would imply the execution of a penal jurisdiction over those whom they carried away, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; would refer to prescriptive facts such as are recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-32.htm">1 Samuel 15:32</a>. (Hitzig). But it would become the religious lyric poet least of all to entertain such an unconditional prospect of the execution of the conquered worldly rulers. There is just as little ground for thinking of the judgment of extermination pronounced upon the nations of Canaan, which was pronounced upon them for an especial reason. If <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-9.htm">Psalm 149:9</a> is taken as co-ordinate, the "written judgment" (Recht) consists in the complete carrying out of the subjugation; and this is commended by the perfectly valid parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>. The poet, however, in connection with the expression "written," has neither this nor that passage of Scripture in his mind, but the testimony of the Law and of prophecy in general, that all kingdoms shall become God's and His Christ's. Subjugation (and certainly not without bloodshed) is the scriptural &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; for the execution of which Jahve makes use of His own nation. Because the God who thus vindicates Himself is Israel's God, this subjugation of the world is &#1492;&#1491;&#1512;, splendour and glory, to all who are in love devoted to Him. The glorifying of Jahve is also the glorifying of Israel. </body></html>
