We must so trust in him at all times, as not at any time to put that trust in ourselves, or in any creature, which is to be put in him only. Trust in him to guide us when in doubt, to protect us when in danger, to supply us when in want, to strengthen us for every good word and work. We must lay out wants and our wishes before him, and then patiently submit our wills to his: this is pouring out our hearts. God is a refuge for all, even for as many as will take shelter in him. The psalmist warns against trusting in men. The multitude, those of low degree, are changeable as the wind. The rich and noble seem to have much in their power, and lavish promises; but those that depend on them, are disappointed. Weighed in the balance of Scripture, all that man can do to make us happy is lighter than vanity itself. It is hard to have riches, and not to trust in them if they increase, though by lawful and honest means; but we must take heed, lest we set our affections unduly upon them. A smiling world is the most likely to draw the heart from God, on whom alone it should be set. The consistent believer receives all from God as a trust; and he seeks to use it to his glory, as a steward who must render an account. God hath spoken as it were once for all, that power belongs to him alone. He can punish and destroy. Mercy also belongs to him; and his recompensing the imperfect services of those that believe in him, blotting out their transgressions for the Redeemer's sake, is a proof of abundant mercy, and encourages us to trust in him. Let us trust in his mercy and grace, and abound in his work, expecting mercies from him alone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/62.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Trust not in oppression - The general meaning here is, that we are not to trust in anything but God. In the previous verse the psalmist had stated reasons why we should not trust in men of any rank. In this verse he enumerates several things on which people are accustomed to rely, or in which they place confidence, and he says that we should put no confidence in them in respect to the help which we need, or the great objects which are to be accomplished by us. The first thing mentioned is oppression; and the idea is, that we must not hope to accomplish our object by oppressing others; extorting their property or their service; making them by force subject to us, and subservient to our wishes. Many do this. Conquerors do it. Tyrants do it. The owners of slaves do it.<p>And become not vain in robbery - That is, Do not resort to theft or robbery, and depend on that for what is needed in life. Many do. The great robbers of the world - conquerors - have done it. Thieves and burglars do it. People who seek to defraud others of their earnings do it. They who withhold wages from laborers, and they who cheat in trade, do it.<p>If riches increase, set not your heart upon them - If you become rich without oppression, or without robbery. If your riches seem to grow of themselves - for that is the meaning of the original word (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-2.htm">Mark 4:2</a>) - do not rely on them as being all that you require. People are prone to do this. The rich man confides in his wealth, and supposes that he has all he needs. The psalmist says that none of these things constitute the true reliance of man. None of them can supply his real needs; none can defend him in the great perils of his existence; hone can save his soul. He needs, over and above all these, a God and Saviour; and it is such a God and Saviour only that can meet the real needs of his nature. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/62.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

There is no necessity for regarding &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (not &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;), which is always a substantive (not only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/39-3.htm">Psalm 39:3</a>, but also in this instance and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-2.htm">Psalm 65:2</a>), and which is related to &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, silence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm">Psalm 94:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>, just as &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>, is related to &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, as an accus. absol.: in silent submission (Hupfeld). Like &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, it is a predicate: his soul is silent submission, i.e., altogether resigned to God without any purpose and action of its own. His salvation comes from God, yea, God Himself is his salvation, so that, while God is his God, he is even already in possession of salvation, and by virtue of it stands imperturbably firm. We see clearly from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-24.htm">Psalm 37:24</a>, what the poet means by &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;. He will not greatly, very much, particularly totter, i.e., not so that it should come to his falling and remaining down. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; is an adverb like &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>, and &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a>.<p>There is some difficulty about the &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; .&#1500;&#1503;&#1491;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a>). Abulwald, whom Parchon, Kimchi, and most others follow, compares the Arabic hatta 'l-rajul, the man brags; but this Arab. ht (intensive form htht) signifies only in a general way to speak fluently, smoothly and rapidly one word after another, which would give too poor an idea here. There is another Arab. htt (cogn. htk, proscindere) which has a meaning that is even better suited to this passage, and one which is still retained in the spoken language of Syria at the present day: hattani is equivalent to "he compromised me" ( equals  hataka es-sitra &#8219;ann&#305;&#770;, he has pulled my veil down), dishonoured me before the world by speaking evil concerning me; whence in Damascus el-hetta&#770;t is the appellation for a man who without any consideration insults a person before others, whether he be present or absent at the time. But this Arab. htt only occurs in Kal and with an accusative of the object. The words &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; &#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; find their most satisfactory explanation in the Arab. hwwt in common use in Damascus at the present day, which is not used in Kal, but only in the intensive form. The Piel Arab. hwwt &#8219;la&#770; fla&#770;n signifies to rush upon any one, viz., with a shout and raised fist in order to intimidate him.<p>(Note: Neshwn and the Kms say: "hawwata and hajjata bi-fula&#770;n-in signifies to call out to any one in order to put him in terror (Arab. s&#803;a&#770;h&#803; bh);" "but in Syria," as Wetzstein goes on to say, "the verb does not occur as med. Jod, nor is hawwata there construed with Arab. b, but only with &#8219;la&#770;. A very ready phrase with the street boys in Damascus is Arab. l-'yy s&#780;' thwwt &#8219;l&#305;&#770;, 'why dost thou threaten me?' ")<p>From this &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, of which even the construction with Arab. &#8219;la&#770;, together with the intensive form is characteristic, we here read the Pil. &#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514;, which is not badly rendered by the lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;, Vulgate irruitis.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-4.htm">Psalm 62:4</a> it is a question whether the reading &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; of the school of Tiberias or the Babylonian &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is to be preferred. Certainly the latter; for the former (to be rendered, "may you" or "ye shall be broken in pieces, slain") produces a thought that is here introduced too early, and one that is inappropriate to the figures that follow. Standing as it still does under the regimen of &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, &#1514;&#1512;&#1510;&#1495;&#1493; is to be read as a Piel; and, as the following figures show, is to be taken, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>, in its primary signification contundere (root &#1512;&#1509;).<p>(Note: The reading of Ben-Asher &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is followed by Aben-Ezra, Kimchi, and others, taking this form (which could not possibly be anything else) as Pual. The reading of Ben-Naphtali &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is already assumed in B. Sanhedrin 119a. Besides these the reading &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; without Dag.) is also found, which cannot be taken as a resolved Piel, since the Metheg is wanting, but is to be read terotzchu, and is to be taken (as also the reading &#1502;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>) as Poal (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-20.htm">Psalm 94:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>).)<p>The sadness of the poet is reflected in the compressed, obscure, and peculiar character of the expression. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; (a single one-ye all) stand in contrast. &#1499;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, sicut parietem  equals  similem parieti (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-6.htm">Psalm 63:6</a>), forms the object to &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;. The transmitted reading &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;, although not incorrect in itself so far as the gender (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>) and the article are concerned (Ges. 111, 2, a), must apparently be altered to &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1492; &#1491;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; (Olshausen and others) in accordance with the parallel member of the verse, since both &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1492; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512; are words that can be used of every kind of surrounding or enclosure. To them David seems like a bent, overhanging wall, like a wall of masonry that has received the thrust that must ultimately cause its fall; and yet they rush in upon him, and all together they pursue against the one man their work of destruction and ruin. Hence he asks, with an indignation that has a somewhat sarcastic tinge about it, how long this never-satiated self-satisfying of their lust of destruction is meant to last. Their determination (&#1497;&#1506;&#1509; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24</a>) is clear. It aims only or entirely (&#1488;&#1498;, here tantummodo, prorsus) at thrusting down from his high position, that is to say from the throne, viz., him, the man at whom they are always rushing (&#1500;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;  equals  &#1500;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;). No means are too base for them in the accomplishment of their object, not even the mask of the hypocrite. The clauses which assume a future form of expression are, logically at least, subordinate clauses (EW. 341, b). The Old Testament language allows itself a change of number like &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, even to the very extreme, in the hurry of emotional utterance. The singular is distributive in this instance: suo quisque ore, like &#1500;&#1493; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>, &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>.
