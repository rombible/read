He is no less willing than able to defend, preserve, and do good to those that trust in him. For he is as truly the <span class="ital">best, </span>as he is the <span class="ital">greatest </span>of beings, merciful and gracious, yea, <span class="ital">the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation and good hope. </span>This is a further reason why we should trust in him, and answers the objections of our sinfulness and unworthiness; though we deserve nothing but his wrath, yet we may hope for all good from his mercy, which is <span class="ital">over all his works. For, </span>or <span class="ital">therefore, thou renderest, </span>&c. — For the following words seem to be added, either as a proof of, or an inference from, the two foregoing properties of God, <span class="ital">power </span>and <span class="ital">mercy. </span>God is almighty, therefore he can easily destroy all his enemies: he is merciful, and therefore will pardon good men’s failings, and graciously reward their integrity; <span class="ital">according to his work — </span>Which, as he is obliged to do, by his own holy nature, so he is able to do it, being omnipotent, and willing to do it to the godly, notwithstanding their manifold infirmities and miscarriages, because he is merciful and gracious. Though God doth not always do this visibly in this world, yet he will do it in the day of final recompense. No service done to him shall go unrewarded; nor any affront given him unpunished, unless repented of. Thus it appears that power and mercy belong to him. If he were not a God of power, there are sinners that would be too high to be punished; and if he were not a God of mercy, there are services too worthless to be rewarded. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/62.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>62:8-12 Those who have found the comfort of the ways of God themselves, will invite others into those ways; we shall never have the less for others sharing with us. the good counsel given is, to trust wholly in God. We must so trust in him at all times, as not at any time to put that trust in ourselves, or in any creature, which is to be put in him only. Trust in him to guide us when in doubt, to protect us when in danger, to supply us when in want, to strengthen us for every good word and work. We must lay out wants and our wishes before him, and then patiently submit our wills to his: this is pouring out our hearts. God is a refuge for all, even for as many as will take shelter in him. The psalmist warns against trusting in men. The multitude, those of low degree, are changeable as the wind. The rich and noble seem to have much in their power, and lavish promises; but those that depend on them, are disappointed. Weighed in the balance of Scripture, all that man can do to make us happy is lighter than vanity itself. It is hard to have riches, and not to trust in them if they increase, though by lawful and honest means; but we must take heed, lest we set our affections unduly upon them. A smiling world is the most likely to draw the heart from God, on whom alone it should be set. The consistent believer receives all from God as a trust; and he seeks to use it to his glory, as a steward who must render an account. God hath spoken as it were once for all, that power belongs to him alone. He can punish and destroy. Mercy also belongs to him; and his recompensing the imperfect services of those that believe in him, blotting out their transgressions for the Redeemer's sake, is a proof of abundant mercy, and encourages us to trust in him. Let us trust in his mercy and grace, and abound in his work, expecting mercies from him alone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/62.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy - Power, indeed, belongs to God <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>; but this is an attribute to be feared, and while, in one respect, it will inspire confidence, or while it gives us the assurance that God is able to defend us when all else shall fail, yet, unattended by any other attribute, it might produce only apprehension and alarm. What man, weak and sinful man, needs to know is not merely that God has almighty power, but how that power will be wielded, or with what other attributes it is combined; whether it will be put forth to destroy or to save; to kill or to keep alive; to crush or to uphold. Man, therefore, needs the assurance that God is a benevolent Being, as really as that he is a powerful Being; that he is disposed to show mercy; that his power will be put forth in behalf of those who confide in him, and not employed against them. Hence, the attribute of mercy is so essential to a proper conception of God; and hence, the psalm so appropriately closes by a reference to his mercy and compassion.<p>For thou renderest to every man according to his work - As this stands in our version, it would seem that the psalmist regarded what is here referred to as a manifestation of mercy. Yet the "rendering to every man according to his work" is an act of justice rather than of mercy. It is probable, therefore, that the word rendered "for" - &#1499;&#1497;  k&#305;&#770;y - does not refer here to either of the attributes mentioned exclusively - either power or mercy - but is to be understood with reference to the general course of argument in the psalm, as adapted to lead to confidence in God. The fact that he is a God who will deal impartially with mankind, or who will regard what is right and proper to be done in view of the characters of mankind, is a reason why they should confide in God - since there could be no just ground of confidence in a Being who is not thus impartial and just. All these combined - power, mercy, equity - constitute a reason why people should confide in God. If either of these were missing in the divine character, man could have no confidence in God. If these things do exist in God, unlimited confidence may be placed in him as having all needful power to save; as being so merciful that sinful people may trust in him; and as being so just and equal in his dealings that all may feel that it is right to repose confidence in a Being by whom all the interests of the universe will be secured.

And this, as he is obliged to do by his holy nature, and by that respect which he oweth to his own glory, so he is able to do it, being omnipotent, and willing to do it to the godly, (which was the only thing that might be doubted, because of their manifold and great corruptions, and imperfections, and miscarriages,) because he is merciful and gracious. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/62.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy,.... This is the other thing the psalmist had heard, and was assured of, and which encouraged his hope and trust in the Lord; that mercy belonged to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-7.htm">Psalm 130:7</a>; as appears, not only from the common bounties of his providence, daily bestowed upon his creatures; but from the special gift of his Son, and of all spiritual mercies and blessings in him; from the regeneration of the Lord's people, the pardon of their sins, and their eternal salvation; <p>for thou renderest to every man according to his work; and which is a reason proving that both power and mercy belong to God; power in punishing the wicked according to their deserts, and mercy in rewarding the saints, not in a way of merit, or of debt, but of grace. Some interpret the words, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi observe, "though thou renderest", &amp;c. that is, God is gracious and merciful, though he is also just and righteous in rendering to every man as his work is, whether it be good or evil. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/62.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also unto thee, O Lord, <i>belongeth</i> mercy: for thou <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> renderest to every man according to his work.</span><p>(k) So that the wicked will feel your power, and the godly your mercy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/62.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also unto thee, O Lord,</span> <span class="cmt_word">belongeth mercy;</span> or, <span class="accented">loving kindness</span>.

The poet again takes up the emotional affirmations of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a>, and, firm and defiant in faith, opposes them to his masked enemies. Here what he says to his soul is very similar to what he said of his soul in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, inasmuch as he makes his own soul objective and exalts himself above her; and it is just in this that the secret of personality consists. He here admonishes her to that silence which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a> he has already acknowledged as her own; because all spiritual existence as being living remains itself unchanged only by means of a perpetual "becoming" (mittelst steten Werdens), of continuous, self-conscious renovation. The "hope" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-6.htm">Psalm 62:6</a> is intended to be understood according to that which forms its substance, which here is nothing more nor less than salvation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>. That for which he who resigns himself to God hopes, comes from God; it cannot therfore fail him, for God the Almighty One and plenteous in mercy is surety for it. David renounces all help in himself, all personal avenging of his own honour - his salvation and his honour are &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). The rock of his strength, i.e., his strong defence, his refuge, is &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;; it is where Elohim is, Elohim is it in person (&#1489;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>). By &#1506;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>, the king addresses those who have reamined faithful to him, whose feeble faith he has had to chide and sustain in other instances also in the Psalms belonging to this period. The address does not suit the whole people, who had become for the most part drawn into the apostasy. Moreover it would then have been &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; (my people). &#1506;&#1501; frequently signifies the people belonging to the retinue of a prince (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-18.htm">Judges 3:18</a>), or in the service of any person of rank (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-21.htm">1 Kings 19:21</a>), or belonging to any union of society whatever (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a>.). David thus names those who cleave to him; and the fact that he cannot say "my people" just shows that the people as a body had become alienated from him. But those who have remained to him of the people are not therefore to despair; but they are to pour out before God, who will know how to protect both them and their king, whatever may lie heavily upon their heart. </body></html>
