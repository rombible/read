There is indeed an ellipsis, but, as Dr. Horne observes, would it not be better to supply it thus: “Mine eye shall behold the fall of mine enemies; and mine ears shall hear of the destruction of the wicked?” &c. The psalmist undoubtedly foresaw their dreadful doom, but we cannot infer, from that circumstance, that he desired it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/92.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>92:7-15 God sometimes grants prosperity to wicked men in displeasure; yet they flourish but for a moment. Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/92.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mine eye also shall see my desire - That is, I shall be permitted to see the destruction of my foes; I shall be gratified with seeing them overthrown.

Do the words grate upon our ears as we repeat the Psalm?

Whilst &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; is the usual word for God's historical rule (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-10.htm">Psalm 64:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-16.htm">Psalm 90:16</a>, etc.), &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; denotes the works of the Creator of the world, although not to the exclusion of those of the Ruler of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-5.htm">Psalm 143:5</a>). To be able to rejoice over the revelation of God in creation and the revelation of God in general is a gift from above, which the poet thankfully confesses that he has received. The Vulgate begins <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a> Quia delectasti me, and Dante in his Purgatorio, xxviii. 80, accordingly calls the Psalm il Salmo Delectasti; a smiling female form, which represents the life of Paradise, says, as she gathers flowers, she is so happy because, with the Psalm Delectasti, she takes a delight in the glory of God's works. The works of God are transcendently great; very deep are His thoughts, which mould human history and themselves gain from in it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>., where infinite fulness is ascribed to them, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8</a>, where infinite height is ascribed to them). Man can neither measure the greatness of the divine works nor fathom the depth of the divine thoughts; he who is enlightened, however, perceives the immeasurableness of the one and the unfathomableness of the other, whilst a &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, a man of animal nature, homo brutus (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-22.htm">Psalm 73:22</a>), does not come to the knowledge (&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, used absolutely as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>), and &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, a blockhead, or one dull in mind, whose carnal nature outweighs his intellectual and spiritual nature, does not discern &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-17.htm">2 Samuel 13:17</a>), id ipsum, viz., how unsearchable are God's judgments and untrackable His ways (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). </body></html>
