Let us give thanks every morning for the mercies of the night, and every night for the mercies of the day; going out, and coming in, let us bless God. As He makes us glad, through the works of his providence for us, and of his grace in us, and both through the great work of redemption, let us hence be encouraged. As there are many who know not the designs of Providence, nor care to know them, those who through grace do so, have the more reason to be thankful. And if distant views of the great Deliverer so animated believers of old, how should we abound in love and praise!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/92.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon an instrument of ten strings - The general idea in this verse is, that instruments "of all kinds" are to be employed in celebrating the praises of God. On the instrument here referred to, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>.<p>And upon the psaltery - Or "lyre." See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>. The word is there translated viol.<p>Upon the harp with a solemn sound - Margin, upon the solemn sound with the harp." Prof. Alexander renders this, "On meditation with a harp." On the word rendered "harp," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>. The Hebrew word rendered "solemn sound" is &#1492;&#1490;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  higga&#770;yo&#770;n which means properly "murmur;" then, the sound of a harp; and then, meditation. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>. Here the meaning seems to be, "with murmurs upon the harp;" that is, with the sound of the harp - its murmuring tones. It does not denote here a distinct instrument of music, but it refers to the tones of the harp: not to the meditations of the mind - of the worshipper - but to the low and gentle sounds of the instrument itself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/92.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. In such a work all proper aid must be used.<p>with a &#8230; sound&#8212;or, on Higgaion (see on [629]Ps 9:16), perhaps an instrument of that name, from its sound resembling the muttered sound of meditation, as expressed also by the word.

An harp of ten strings, as the Targum.

The promises rise ever higher and higher and sound more glorious. The Pual &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, prop. to be turned towards, is equivalent to "to befall one," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-21.htm">Proverbs 12:21</a>; Aquila well renders: &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; reminds one of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-14.htm">Isaiah 54:14</a>, where &#1488;&#1500; follows; here it is &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm">Judges 19:13</a>. The angel guardianship which is apportioned to him who trusts in God appears in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a> as a universal fact, not as a solitary fact and occurring only in extraordinary instances. Haec est vera miraculorum ratio, observes Brentius on this passage, quod semel aut iterum manifeste revelent ea quae Deus semper abscondite operatur. In &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1498; the suffix has been combined with the full form of the future.

The promise calls to mind <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>, &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, they shall take up serpents, but still more <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a> : Behold, I give you power to tread &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. They are all kinds of destructive powers belonging to nature, and particularly to the spirit-world, that are meant. They are called lions and fierce lions from the side of their open power, which threatens destruction, and adders and dragons from the side of their venomous secret malice. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a> it is promised that the man who trusts in God shall walk on over these monsters, these malignant foes, proud in God and unharmed; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>, that he shall tread them to the ground (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>). That which the divine voice of promise now says at the close of the Psalm is, so far as the form is concerned, an echo taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a> of that Psalm sound almost word for word the same. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-4.htm">Genesis 46:4</a>, and more especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, are to be compared on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>. In B. Taanith 16a it is inferred from this passage that God compassionates the suffering ones whom He is compelled by reason of His holiness to chasten and prove. The "salvation of Jahve," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, is the full reality of the divine purpose (or counsel) of mercy. To live to see the final glory was the rapturous thought of the Old Testament hope, and in the apostolic age, of the New Testament hope also. </body></html>
