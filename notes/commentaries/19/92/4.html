But the reference is to the <span class= "ital">works in history, </span>not in <span class= "ital">nature. </span>The psalmist is really expressing his gladness at God’s wonders wrought for Israel. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/90-15.htm" title="Make us glad according to the days wherein you have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.">Psalm 90:15-16</a>,” Make us glad <span class= "bld">. . .</span> let thy work appear unto thy servants.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/92.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/92-4.htm" title="For you, LORD, have made me glad through your work: I will triumph in the works of your hands....">Psalm 92:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">For thou hast made me glad through thy work, </span>&c. — Which thou didst create by thine almighty power, and dost still govern with infinite wisdom. “A prospect of creation, in the vernal season,” says Dr. Horne, “fallen as it is, inspires the mind with joy, which no words can express. But how doth the regenerate soul exult and triumph at beholding that work of God’s hands whereby he creates all things anew in Christ Jesus! If we can be pleased with such a world as this, where sin and death have fixed their habitation; shall we not much rather admire those other heavens and that other earth wherein dwell righteousness and life? What are we to think of the <span class="ital">palace, </span>since even the <span class="ital">prison </span>is not without its charms!” <span class="ital">O Lord, how great are thy works! — </span>Great beyond expression, beyond conception! The products of boundless power and unsearchable wisdom; men’s works are nothing to them. We cannot comprehend the greatness of God’s works, and therefore must reverently and awfully wonder, and even stand amazed at the magnificence of them. <span class="ital">Thy thoughts are very deep — </span>Here he assigns the reason of the inconceivable greatness and grandeur of God’s works. Mens’ works are little and trifling, for their thoughts are shallow: but God’s works are very great, and such as cannot be measured, because his thoughts are very deep, and such as cannot be fathomed. Or, he speaks of God’s counsels and methods in the government of the world and of his church. All his counsels, whether in creation or providence, as much exceed the contrivances of human wisdom as his works do the efforts of human power!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/92.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>92:1-6 It is a privilege that we are admitted to praise the Lord, and hope to be accepted in the morning, and every night; not only on sabbath days, but every day; not only in public, but in private, and in our families. Let us give thanks every morning for the mercies of the night, and every night for the mercies of the day; going out, and coming in, let us bless God. As He makes us glad, through the works of his providence for us, and of his grace in us, and both through the great work of redemption, let us hence be encouraged. As there are many who know not the designs of Providence, nor care to know them, those who through grace do so, have the more reason to be thankful.

The promises rise ever higher and higher and sound more glorious. The Pual &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, prop. to be turned towards, is equivalent to "to befall one," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-21.htm">Proverbs 12:21</a>; Aquila well renders: &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; reminds one of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-14.htm">Isaiah 54:14</a>, where &#1488;&#1500; follows; here it is &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm">Judges 19:13</a>. The angel guardianship which is apportioned to him who trusts in God appears in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a> as a universal fact, not as a solitary fact and occurring only in extraordinary instances.

The promise calls to mind <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>, &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, they shall take up serpents, but still more <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a> : Behold, I give you power to tread &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. They are all kinds of destructive powers belonging to nature, and particularly to the spirit-world, that are meant. They are called lions and fierce lions from the side of their open power, which threatens destruction, and adders and dragons from the side of their venomous secret malice. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a> it is promised that the man who trusts in God shall walk on over these monsters, these malignant foes, proud in God and unharmed; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>, that he shall tread them to the ground (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>). That which the divine voice of promise now says at the close of the Psalm is, so far as the form is concerned, an echo taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a> of that Psalm sound almost word for word the same. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-4.htm">Genesis 46:4</a>, and more especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, are to be compared on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>. In B. Taanith 16a it is inferred from this passage that God compassionates the suffering ones whom He is compelled by reason of His holiness to chasten and prove. The "salvation of Jahve," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, is the full reality of the divine purpose (or counsel) of mercy. To live to see the final glory was the rapturous thought of the Old Testament hope, and in the apostolic age, of the New Testament hope also. </body></html>
