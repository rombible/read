Let us give thanks every morning for the mercies of the night, and every night for the mercies of the day; going out, and coming in, let us bless God. As He makes us glad, through the works of his providence for us, and of his grace in us, and both through the great work of redemption, let us hence be encouraged. As there are many who know not the designs of Providence, nor care to know them, those who through grace do so, have the more reason to be thankful. And if distant views of the great Deliverer so animated believers of old, how should we abound in love and praise!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/92.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord - literally, "Good is it to give thanks unto Jehovah." That is, the act is appropriate; the effect is good.<p>(1) The thing itself is appropriate, for there is much, under all circumstances, to be thankful for: life, health, food, raiment, air, water, friends, recollections, hopes - and, above all, the blessings of redemption, and the assurance that we may be happy forever. Many of these things may be found in the condition of all; but if all else fail, the hope of heaven - the assurance that the Redeemer died - the offer of salvation - cannot fail. That is ours, and cannot be taken away.<p>(2) The effect is good. It is a desirable state of mind. It tends to happiness, contentment, peace. A gloomy mind makes all things around more gloomy; an unthankful mind is an unhappy mind; a murmuring, complaining, dissatisfied mind makes its possessor wretched, and all around him miserable.<p>(3) it is good as it is due to God. For all his favor we should be thankful - and all that we enjoy is his gift.<p>(4) it tends much to lessen the real troubles and afflictions of life to dwell on those things for which we should be thankful.<p>And to sing praises unto thy name - Unto thee. As this psalm was designed for the "Sabbath day," this proves that one of the appropriate services of the Sabbath is "praise." It is a day when it is fit to recall the mercies of God to our recollection; and the remembrance of those mercies, and their celebration by appropriate songs, tend to diffuse joy over all the coming days of the week.<p>O Most High - God exalted over all. The fact that "he" is exalted over all - over us - over our friends - over all worlds - is an appropriate thought when we come before him to praise him; appropriate at all times, and in all circumstances of life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/92.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 92<p>Ps 92:1-15.

It is good ethically, for it is the Lord's right; it is good emotionally, for it is pleasant to the heart; it is good practically, for it leads others to render the same homage. When duty and pleasure combine, who will be backward? To give thanks to God is but a small return for the great benefits wherewith he daily loadeth us; yet as he by his Spirit calls it a good thing, we must not despise it, or neglect it. We thank men when they oblige us, how much more ought we to bless the Lord when he benefits us. Devout praise is always good, it is never out of season, never superfluous, but it is especially suitable to the Sabbath; a Sabbath without thanksgiving is a Sabbath profaned. "And to sing praises unto thy name, O most High." It is good to give thanks in the form of vocal song. Nature itself teaches us thus to express our gratitude to God; do not the birds sing, and the brooks warble as they flow? To give his gratitude a tongue is wise in man. Silent worship is sweet, but vocal worship is sweeter. To deny the tongue the privilege of uttering the praises of God involves an unnatural strain upon the most commendable promptings of our renewed manhood, and it is a problem to us how the members of the Society of Friends can deprive themselves of so noble, so natural, so inspiring a part of sacred worship. Good as they are, they miss one good thing when they decline to sing praises unto the name of the Lord. Our personal experience has confirmed us in the belief that it is good to sing unto the Lord; we have often felt like Luther when he said, "Come, let us sing a Psalm, and drive away the devil."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-2.htm">Psalm 92:2</a><p>"To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning." The day should begin with praise; no hour is too early for holy song. Lovingkindness is a most appropriate theme for those dewy hours when morn is sowing all the earth with orient pearl. Eagerly and promptly should we magnify the Lord; we leave unpleasant tasks as long as we can, but our hearts are so engrossed with the adoration of God that we would rise betimes to attend to it. There is a peculiar freshness and charm about early morning praises; the day is loveliest when it first opens its eyelids, and God himself seems then to make distribution of the day's mamma, which tastes most sweetly if gathered ere the sun is hot. It seems most meet that if our hearts and harps have been silent through the shades of night, we should be eager again to take our place among the chosen choir who ceaselessly hymn the Eternal One. "And thy faithfulness every night." No hour is too late for praise, the end of the day must not be the end of gratitude. When nature seems in silent contemplation to adore its Maker, it ill becomes the children of God to refrain their thanksgiving. Evening is the time for retrospect, memory is busy with the experience of the day, hence the appropriate theme for song is the divine faithfulness, of which another day has furnished fresh evidences. When darkness has settled down o'er all things, "a shade immense," then there comes over wise men a congenial, meditative spirit, and it is most fitting that they should take an expanded view of the truth and goodness of Jehovah - <p>"This sacred shade and solitude, what is it?<p>'Tis the felt presence of the Deity."<p>"Every night," clouded or clear, moonlit or dark, calm or tempestuous, is alike suitable for a song upon the faithfulness of God, since in all seasons, and under all circumstances, it abides the same, and is the mainstay of the believer's consolation. Shame on us that we are so backward in magnifying the Lord, who in the daytime scatters bounteous love, and in the night season walks his rounds of watching care.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a><p>"Upon an instrument of ten strings;" with the fullest range of music, uttering before God with the full compass of melody the richest emotions of his soul. "And upon the psaltery:" thus giving variety to praise: the Psalmist felt that every sweet-sounding instrument should be consecrated to God. George Herbert and Martin Luther aided their private devotions by instrumental music; and whatever may have been the differences of opinion in the Christian church, as to the performance of instrumental music in public, we have met with no objection to its personal and private use. "Upon the harp with a solemn sound," or upon meditation with a harp; as much as to say, my meditative soul is, after all, the best instrument, and the harp's dulcet tones come in to aid my thoughts. It is blessed work when hand and tongue work together in the heavenly occupation of praise.<p>"Strings and voices, hands and hearts,<p>continued...To be sung upon the weekly sabbath; to which the matter of this Psalm very well agrees.

For all mercies, temporal and spiritual; for Christ, and salvation by him; for the Gospel, and for Gospel opportunities and ordinances; for, such days and seasons this psalm was composed for. It is "good" so to do, for it is the will of God that we should in and for every thing give thanks; it is due unto him, and is our reasonable service; it is well pleasing unto God through Christ; it is pleasant work for the saints themselves, and is profitable unto them; to be thankful for what they have is the way to have more. Kimchi connects this with the title; the sabbath day is good to give thanks unto the Lord; it is a very fit opportunity for such service; when a man is at leisure from worldly business, and his heart is engaged in spiritual exercises, and especially when it is warmed with the love of God: <p>and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High; a name and epithet of God, suitable to his majesty and glory, to his supereminence over all his creatures, and the place where he dwells, and to whom the highest praises are due; these two phrases, giving thanks, and singing praise, are much the same; only with this difference, the former may be done in prayer, and without the modulation of the voice, as well as with it; the latter only with it; hence these two are mentioned as distinct things in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>. <p>(a) Zohar in Gen. fol. 43. 2.

The Pual &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, prop. to be turned towards, is equivalent to "to befall one," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-21.htm">Proverbs 12:21</a>; Aquila well renders: &#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; reminds one of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-14.htm">Isaiah 54:14</a>, where &#1488;&#1500; follows; here it is &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-13.htm">Judges 19:13</a>.

The promise calls to mind <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>, &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, they shall take up serpents, but still more <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a> : Behold, I give you power to tread &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. They are all kinds of destructive powers belonging to nature, and particularly to the spirit-world, that are meant. They are called lions and fierce lions from the side of their open power, which threatens destruction, and adders and dragons from the side of their venomous secret malice. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a> it is promised that the man who trusts in God shall walk on over these monsters, these malignant foes, proud in God and unharmed; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>, that he shall tread them to the ground (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>). That which the divine voice of promise now says at the close of the Psalm is, so far as the form is concerned, an echo taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a> of that Psalm sound almost word for word the same. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-4.htm">Genesis 46:4</a>, and more especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, are to be compared on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>. In B. Taanith 16a it is inferred from this passage that God compassionates the suffering ones whom He is compelled by reason of His holiness to chasten and prove. The "salvation of Jahve," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, is the full reality of the divine purpose (or counsel) of mercy. To live to see the final glory was the rapturous thought of the Old Testament hope, and in the apostolic age, of the New Testament hope also. </body></html>
