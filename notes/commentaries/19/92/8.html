Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/92.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore - In the treatment of the righteous and the wicked, thou wilt maintain thine own exalted place as a sovereign.

So this verse gives a reason of the former, as well the first branch of it, why God suffers the wicked to flourish so long, because he is not like man, of short and uncertain continuance here, to whom a little time is long and tedious, who therefore impatiently expects the time of vengeance, and fears lest the offender should escape it; whereas God is unchangeable and everlasting, and therefore long-suffering without any inconvenience, and the longest time of the prosperity of the wicked is but short and inconsiderable in his eyes, <span class="ital">a thousand years being in his sight but as yesterday when it is past</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm" title="For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.">Psalm 90:4</a></span>, and they can never escape out of his hands; as also of the latter branch of the verse, why the wicked shall be destroyed for ever, because God lives and reigns for ever to execute that just sentence of everlasting punishment which he hath pronounced against them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/92.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore,.... God is "the most High"; that is one of his names; he is above all, is higher than the highest; and he dwells on high, and looks down upon the inhabitants of the earth, and sees what is doing among them; and to him they will be accountable another day for what they do; and when wicked, men perish, being destroyed, he will continue for ever in all his greatness, glory, and majesty; for there seems to be an antithesis in this verse to the former, or between wicked men and the Lord; and besides he endures for ever to inflict punishment upon them; and therefore it is that they shall be destroyed for ever. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/92.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But thou, LORD, <i>art <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> most</i> high for evermore.</span><p>(f) Your judgments are most constant against the wicked and pass our reach.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/92.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou, Lord, art most high forevermore;</span> rather, <span class="accented">art on high</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> remainest seated upon thy throne, unaffected either by their efforts or by their fall. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/92.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Sabbath is the day that God has hallowed, and that is to be consecrated to God by our turning away from the business pursuits of the working days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a>.) and applying ourselves to the praise and adoration of God, which is the most proper, blessed Sabbath employment. It is good, i.e., not merely good in the eyes of God, but also good for man, beneficial to the heart, pleasant and blessed. Loving-kindness is designedly connected with the dawn of the morning, for it is morning light itself, which breaks through the night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-17.htm">Psalm 59:17</a>), and faithfulness with the nights, for in the perils of the loneliness of the night it is the best companion, and nights of affliction are the "foil of its verification." &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1512; beside &#1504;&#1489;&#1500; (&#1504;&#1489;&#1500;) is equivalent to &#1504;&#1489;&#1500; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a> : the ten-stringed harp or lyre. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is the music of stringed instruments (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a>), and that, since &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; in itself is not a suitable word for the rustling (strepitus) of the strings, the impromptu or phantasia playing (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>, scornfully, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1496;), which suits both <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a> (where it is appended to the forte of the interlude) and the construction with Beth instrumenti. </body></html>
