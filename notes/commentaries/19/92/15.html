Let us seek for ourselves the salvation and grace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, we may behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by his word and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps them alive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes their best days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sure evidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth the Divine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lord our righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/92.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To shew that the Lord is upright - That is, This will be a proof that God is faithful to his promises; that he is the true friend of his people. The fact that they live long - that they are happy and useful even in old age, will be a demonstration that God is the friend of virtue, and that he deals with people according to their character.<p>He is my rock - He is my defense; that which constitutes my security. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. This is language of strong confidence in view of all that is said in the psalm.<p>And there is no unrighteousness in him - This is said in the most absolute form - implying the most entire confidence. God is altogether to be trusted. There is no evil or wrong in his character or in his dealings. In all respects he is worthy of confidence: "worthy" to be loved, trusted, adored, obeyed, by the inhabitants of all worlds. What a sublime thought is this! What a consolatory truth! What would the universe be if God, a Being of infinite POWER, were not a Being of perfect RIGHTEOUSNESS, and could not be trusted by the creatures which he has made! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/92.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. and they thus declare God's glory as their strong and righteous ruler.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/92.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This glorious work of God in compensating the short prosperity of the wicked with everlasting punishments, and of exchanging the momentary afflictions of the just with eternal glory and happiness, doth clearly demonstrate that God is just and blameless in all the dispensations of his providence in the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/92.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To show that the Lord is upright,.... Or righteous, that is, faithful; as he is in his counsels, covenant, and promises, which he makes good by causing his people to grow and flourish, and become fruitful; by carrying on the work of grace upon their souls, and by preserving them to the end safe to his kingdom and glory; by all which it appears that he does not and will not suffer his faithfulness to fail: the Targum is, <p>"that the inhabitants of the earth may show, &amp;c.'' <p>he is my Rock; the psalmist sets his seal to the truth of God's faithfulness, firmness, and constancy, calling him a Rock for his strength and stability, and claiming his interest in him; declaring he found him to be so by experience, <p>even the Rock whose work is perfect; who always completes what he undertakes, and finishes what he begins, and will not forsake the work of his own hands: <p>just and right is he; the Rock of ages, that remains firm, steadfast, and unalterable in all generations: <p>and there is no unrighteousness in him; as not in his sovereign acts of grace, so neither in his providential dispensations, either towards good men or bad men; not in suffering the wicked to prosper, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a>, and the righteous to be afflicted; nor in punishing bad men here, or hereafter; nor in justifying sinners by the righteousness of his Son, and giving them the crown of righteousness at the last day: all his proceedings are in the most just and equitable manner; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-14.htm">Romans 9:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/92.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/92.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">To shew</span> &c.] To witness by their prosperity to the faithfulness and justice of Jehovah.

The infinitive construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-8.htm">Psalm 92:8</a> is continued in the historic tense, and it may also be rendered as historical. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; (Saadia: Arab. fa&#770;nnh) is to be supplied in thought before &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1491;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-14.htm">Job 27:14</a>. What is spoken of is an historical occurrence which, in its beginning, course, and end, has been frequently repeated even down to the present day, and ever confirmed afresh. And thus, too, in time to come and once finally shall the ungodly succumb to a peremptory, decisive (&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1491;) judgment of destruction. Jahve is &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, by His nature and by His rule He is "a height for ever;" i.e., in relation to the creature and all that goes on here below He has a nature beyond and above all this (Jenseitigkeit), ever the same and absolute; He is absolutely inaccessible to the God-opposed one here below who vaunts himself in stupid pride and rebelliously exalts himself as a titan, and only suffers it to last until the term of his barren blossoming is run out. Thus the present course of history will and must in fact end in a final victory of good over evil: for lo Thine enemies, Jahve - for lo Thine enemies.... &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; points as it were with the finger to the inevitable end; and the emotional anadiplosis breathes forth a zealous love for the cause of God as if it were his own. God's enemies shall perish, all the workers of evil shall be disjointed, scattered, &#1497;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>). Now they form a compact mass, which shall however fall to pieces, when one day the intermingling of good and evil has an end. </body></html>
