The psalmist resolved to continue in prayer, and the more so, because deliverance did not come speedily. Though our prayers are not soon answered, yet we must not give over praying. The greater our troubles, the more earnest and serious we should be in prayer. Nothing grieves a child of God so much as losing sight of him; nor is there any thing he so much dreads as God's casting off his soul. If the sun be clouded, that darkens the earth; but if the sun should leave the earth, what a dungeon would it be! Even those designed for God's favours, may for a time suffer his terrors. See how deep those terrors wounded the psalmist. If friends are put far from us by providences, or death, we have reason to look upon it as affliction. Such was the calamitous state of a good man. But the pleas here used were peculiarly suited to Christ. And we are not to think that the holy Jesus suffered for us only at Gethsemane and on Calvary. His whole life was labour and sorrow; he was afflicted as never man was, from his youth up. He was prepared for that death of which he tasted through life. No man could share in the sufferings by which other men were to be redeemed. All forsook him, and fled. Oftentimes, blessed Jesus, do we forsake thee; but do not forsake us, O take not thy Holy Spirit from us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/88.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They came round about me daily like water - Margin, "as in" Hebrew, all the day.

The complaint concerning the alienation of his nearest relations sounds like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13</a>., but the same strain is also frequently heard in the earlier Psalms written in times of suffering, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-9.htm">Psalm 31:9</a>. He is forsaken by all his familiar friends (not: acquaintances, for &#1502;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506; signifies more than that), he is alone in the dungeon of wretchedness, where no one comes near him, and whence he cannot make his escape. This sounds, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13</a>, very much like the complaint of a leper. The Book of Leviticus there passes over from the uncleanness attending the beginning of human life to the uncleanness of the most terrible disease. Disease is the middle stage between birth and death, and, according to the Eastern notion, leprosy is the worst of all diseases, it is death itself clinging to the still living man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-12.htm">Numbers 12:12</a>), and more than all other evils a stroke of the chastening hand of God (&#1504;&#1490;&#1506;), a scourge of God (&#1510;&#1512;&#1506;&#1514;). The man suspected of having leprosy was to be subjected to a seven days' quarantine until the determination of the priest's diagnosis; and if the leprosy was confirmed, he was to dwell apart outside the camp (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>), where, though not imprisoned, he was nevertheless separated from his dwelling and his family (cf. Job, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a>), and if a man of position, would feel himself condemned to a state of involuntary retirement. It is natural to refer the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, which is closely connected with &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, to this separation. &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10</a>, instead of &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a> : his eye has languished, vanished away (&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; of the same root as ta&#772;bescere, cognate with the root of &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1490;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a>), in consequence of (his) affliction. He calls and calls upon Jahve, stretches out (&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1468;&#1495;, expandere, according to the Arabic, more especially after the manner of a roof) his hands (palmas) towards Him, in order to shield himself from His wrath and to lead Him compassionately to give ear to him. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11-13</a> he bases his cry for help upon a twofold wish, viz., to become an object of the miraculous help of God, and to be able to praise Him for it. Neither of these wishes would be realized if he were to die; for that which lies beyond this life is uniform darkness, devoid of any progressive history. With &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; alternates &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (sing. &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;), the relaxed ones, i.e., shades (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;) of the nether world. With reference to &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, vid., Ewald, 337, b. Beside &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>.) stands &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, the land of forgetfulness (&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;), where there is an end of all thinking, feeling, and acting (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5-6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>), and where the monotony of death, devoid of thought and recollection, reigns. Such is the representation given in the Old Testament of the state beyond the present, even in Ecclesiastes, and in the Apocrypha (Sir. 17:27f. after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18</a>.; Baruch 2:17f.); and it was obliged to be thus represented, for in the New Testament not merely the conception of the state after death, but this state itself, is become a different one. </body></html>
