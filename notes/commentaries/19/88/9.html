Thus greatly may good men be afflicted, and such dismal thoughts may they have about their afflictions, and such dark conclusion may they make about their end, through the power of melancholy and the weakness of faith. He complained most of God's displeasure. Even the children of God's love may sometimes think themselves children of wrath and no outward trouble can be so hard upon them as that. Probably the psalmist described his own case, yet he leads to Christ. Thus are we called to look unto Jesus, wounded and bruised for our iniquities. But the wrath of God poured the greatest bitterness into his cup.

This actus directus of fleeing in prayer to the God of salvation, which urges its way through all that is dark and gloomy, is the fundamental characteristic of all true faith. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-2.htm">Psalm 88:2</a> is not to be rendered, as a clause of itself: "by day I cry unto Thee, in the night before Thee" (lxx and Targum), which ought to have been &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, but (as it is also pointed, especially in Baer's text): by day, i.e., in the time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-4.htm">Psalm 56:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-42.htm">Psalm 78:42</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>), when I cry before Thee in the night, let my prayer come...

But in respect of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-19.htm">Job 3:19</a> the adjectival rendering is the more probable; "one set free among the dead" (lxx) is equivalent to one released from the bond of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>), somewhat as in Latin a dead person is called defunctus. God does not remember the dead, i.e., practically, inasmuch as, devoid of any progressive history, their condition remains always the same; they are in fact cut away (&#1504;&#1490;&#1494;&#1512; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-54.htm">Lamentations 3:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>) from the hand, viz., from the guiding and helping hand, of God.

Only those who are not conversant with the subject (as Hupfeld in this instance) imagine that the accentuation marks &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; as a relative clause (cf. on the contrary <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-7.htm">Psalm 8:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>, etc.). &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, to bow down, press down; here used of the turning or directing downwards (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) of the waves, which burst like a cataract over the afflicted one. </body></html>
