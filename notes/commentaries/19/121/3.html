When, therefore, the psalmist styles God his <span class="ital">shade, </span>he means that he protected him from danger, and refreshed him with comforts. <span class="ital">The sun shall not smite thee by day — </span>With excessive heat; <span class="ital">nor the moon by night — </span>With that cold and damp which come into the air by it. Intemperate heats and colds are the springs of many diseases.

Shall I depend upon the strength of the hills? upon princes and great men? No; my confidence is in God only. Or, we must lift up our eyes above the hills; we must look to God who makes all earthly things to us what they are. We must see all our help in God; from him we must expect it, in his own way and time. This psalm teaches us to comfort ourselves in the Lord, when difficulties and dangers are greatest. It is almighty wisdom that contrives, and almighty power that works the safety of those that put themselves under God's protection. He is a wakeful, watchful Keeper; he is never weary; he not only does not sleep, but he does not so much as slumber. Under this shade they may sit with delight and assurance. He is always near his people for their protection and refreshment. The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn to their duty, and they shall find God ready to give them success. He will take care that his people shall not fall. Thou shalt not be hurt, neither by the open assaults, nor by the secret attempts of thine enemies. The Lord shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and sanctify, remove, or lighten the evil thou feelest. He will preserve the soul, that it be not defiled by sin, and disturbed by affliction; he will preserve it from perishing eternally. He will keep thee in life and death; going out to thy labour in the morning of thy days, and coming home to thy rest when the evening of old age calls thee in. It is a protection for life. The Spirit, who is their Preserver and Comforter, shall abide with them for ever. Let us be found in our work, assured that the blessings promised in this psalm are ours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/121.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He will not suffer thy foot to be moved - He will enable you to stand firm.

This is either an address of the psalmist to his own soul; or to any other good man, his friend and acquaintance, assuring of stability, and of final perseverance in grace to glory. The Lord keeps the feet of his saints from falling: he will not suffer them to be moved out of the spiritual estate in which they stand; nor off of the Foundation and Rock of ages, on which their feet are set, and their goings established; nor out of the house of God, where they are as pillars; nor out of his ways, where he upholds their goings; moved in some sense they may be, yet not "greatly moved"; their feet may be "almost" gone, and their steps "well nigh" slipped, and yet shall not fall finally and totally, or so as to perish; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>; <p>he that keepeth thee will not slumber; neither angels nor men are the keepers of the saints, but the Lord himself; he is the keeper of every individual saint, of every regenerate person, of everyone of his sheep, of every member of his church; he keeps them by his power, he preserves them by his grace, he holds them with his right hand; guides them by his counsel, keeps their feet from falling, and brings them safe to glory: and a watchful keeper he is, he does not so much as slumber; he keeps them night and day, lest any harm them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a>. Gussetius reads the whole as a prayer, "let him not suffer thy foot", &amp;c.

It is maintained by some grammarians that the negative particle <span class="ital">’al</span> “sometimes expresses merely the subjective feeling and sympathy of the speaker with the act” (Davidson, <span class="ital">Syntax</span>, § 128, R. 2), and consequently the rendering of the A.V. is retained in the R.V. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-4.htm" title="Behold, he that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.">Psalm 121:4</a> will then repeat the ‘subjective feeling’ of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-3.htm" title="He will not suffer your foot to be moved: he that keeps you will not slumber.">Psalm 121:3</a></span> as a categorical assertion.

For the petition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a> manifestly arises out of his deplorable situation, which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>. Nevertheless there are also other instances in which &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; might have been expected, where the pointing is &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>), so that consequently &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; may, without any prejudice to the pointing, be taken as a believing expression of the result (cf. the future of the consequence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a>) of the present cry for help. &#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492;, according to the original signification, is a form of the definition of a state or condition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-27.htm">Psalm 44:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/2-10.htm">Jonah 2:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>, is based upon the customary expression &#1510;&#1512; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a> follows the petition which the poet sends up to Jahve in the certainty of being answered. &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; beside &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, although there is no masc. &#1512;&#1502;&#1497; (cf. however the Aramaic &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;), is taken as an adjective after the form &#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which it is also perhaps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a>. The parallelism would make &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; natural, like &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a>; the pointing, which nevertheless disregarded this, will therefore rest upon tradition. The apostrophe in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a> is addressed to the crafty tongue. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; is certainly feminine as a rule; but whilst the tongue as such is feminine, the &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; of the address, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a>, refers to him who has such a kind of tongue (cf. Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a>), and thereby the &#1500;&#1498; is justified; whereas the rendering, "what does it bring to thee, and what does it profit thee?" or, "of what use to thee and what advancement to thee is the crafty tongue?" is indeed possible so far as concerns the syntax (Ges. 147, e), but is unlikely as being ambiguous and confusing in expression. It is also to be inferred from the correspondence between &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; &#1500;&#1498; and the formula of an oath &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;,    <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-22.htm">1 Samuel 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a>, that God is to be thought of as the subject of &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; and &#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;: "what will," or rather, in accordance with the otherwise precative use of the formula and with the petition that here precedes: "what shall He (is He to) give to thee (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>), and what shall He add to thee, thou crafty tongue?" The reciprocal relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> to &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, and of. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> with the superadding &#1506;&#1501; to &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, shows that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> is not now a characterizing of the tongue that continues the apostrophe to it, as Ewald supposes. Consequently <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> gives the answer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a> with the twofold punishment which Jahve will cause the false tongue to feel. The question which the poet, sure of the answering of his cry for help, puts to the false tongue is designed to let the person addressed hear by a flight of sarcasm what he has to expect. The evil tongue is a sharp sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>), a pointed arrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>), and it is like a fire kindled of hell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>). The punishment, too, corresponds to this its nature and conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-4.htm">Psalm 64:4</a>). The "mighty one" (lxx &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) is God Himself, as it is observed in B. Erachin 15b with a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a> : "There is none mighty by the Holy One, blessed is He." He requites the evil tongue like with like. Arrows and coals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a>) appear also in other instances among His means of punishment. It, which shot piercing arrows, is pierced by the sharpened arrows of an irresistibly mighty One; it, which set its neighbour in a fever of anguish, must endure the lasting, sure, and torturingly consuming heat of broom-coals. The lxx renders it in a general sense, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;; Aquila, following Jewish tradition, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; but &#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, Arabic ratam, ratem, is the broom-shrub (e.g., uncommonly frequent in the Belka&#770;). </body></html>
