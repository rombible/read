It is noticeable that the style, “maker of heaven and earth,” is a peculiarity of psalms which are certainly post-exile, and show how strongly the contrast with heathenism impressed the creative power of God on the Hebrew mind. When the idolater, pointing to his visible god, taunted the Israelite with having no god, the reply, that He made the heavens, and the earth, and all things, and that these were the proofs of His being, was most natural. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-11.htm" title="Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.">Jeremiah 10:11</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/121.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>121:1-8 The safety of the godly. - We must not rely upon men and means, instruments and second causes. Shall I depend upon the strength of the hills? upon princes and great men? No; my confidence is in God only. Or, we must lift up our eyes above the hills; we must look to God who makes all earthly things to us what they are. We must see all our help in God; from him we must expect it, in his own way and time. This psalm teaches us to comfort ourselves in the Lord, when difficulties and dangers are greatest. It is almighty wisdom that contrives, and almighty power that works the safety of those that put themselves under God's protection. He is a wakeful, watchful Keeper; he is never weary; he not only does not sleep, but he does not so much as slumber. Under this shade they may sit with delight and assurance. He is always near his people for their protection and refreshment. The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn to their duty, and they shall find God ready to give them success. He will take care that his people shall not fall. Thou shalt not be hurt, neither by the open assaults, nor by the secret attempts of thine enemies. The Lord shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and sanctify, remove, or lighten the evil thou feelest. He will preserve the soul, that it be not defiled by sin, and disturbed by affliction; he will preserve it from perishing eternally. He will keep thee in life and death; going out to thy labour in the morning of thy days, and coming home to thy rest when the evening of old age calls thee in. It is a protection for life. The Spirit, who is their Preserver and Comforter, shall abide with them for ever. Let us be found in our work, assured that the blessings promised in this psalm are ours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/121.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My help cometh from the Lord - From Yahweh.

Who helps his people out of the hands of all their enemies, and out of all their troubles and afflictions; he helps them in the performance of duty, in the exercise of grace, in bearing the cross, in fighting the Lord's battles, and on in their journey; he helps them to all blessings, temporal and spiritual; to all needful supplies of grace here, and glory hereafter; and this help he gives is quick and present, suitable and seasonable, is sufficient, and sometimes with, and sometimes without means; and they have great encouragement to expect it from him, since he is able to give it, being the Maker of heaven and earth; for what is it that he cannot do, who has made both them? And besides, he has promised to help them, and he is faithful that has promised; he has laid help on Christ for them, and set up a throne of grace, where they may hope to find grace and mercy, to help them in time of need; and they have had past experiences of his help and salvation. Arama connects this with the preceding psalm, and interprets this help of help from an evil tongue. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/121.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My help <i>cometh</i> from the LORD, which made <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> heaven and earth.</span><p>(a) He accuses man's ingratitude, which cannot depend on God's power.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/121.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Maker of heaven and earth</span> is a frequent epithet of Jehovah in the later Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-15.htm" title="You are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.">Psalm 115:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-8.htm" title="Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.">Psalm 124:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-3.htm" title="The LORD that made heaven and earth bless you out of Zion.">Psalm 134:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-6.htm" title="Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keeps truth for ever:">Psalm 146:6</a>).

For the petition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a> manifestly arises out of his deplorable situation, which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>. Nevertheless there are also other instances in which &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; might have been expected, where the pointing is &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>), so that consequently &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; may, without any prejudice to the pointing, be taken as a believing expression of the result (cf. the future of the consequence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a>) of the present cry for help. &#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492;, according to the original signification, is a form of the definition of a state or condition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-27.htm">Psalm 44:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/2-10.htm">Jonah 2:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>, is based upon the customary expression &#1510;&#1512; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a> follows the petition which the poet sends up to Jahve in the certainty of being answered. &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; beside &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, although there is no masc. &#1512;&#1502;&#1497; (cf. however the Aramaic &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;), is taken as an adjective after the form &#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which it is also perhaps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a>. The parallelism would make &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; natural, like &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a>; the pointing, which nevertheless disregarded this, will therefore rest upon tradition. The apostrophe in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a> is addressed to the crafty tongue. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; is certainly feminine as a rule; but whilst the tongue as such is feminine, the &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; of the address, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a>, refers to him who has such a kind of tongue (cf. Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a>), and thereby the &#1500;&#1498; is justified; whereas the rendering, "what does it bring to thee, and what does it profit thee?" or, "of what use to thee and what advancement to thee is the crafty tongue?" is indeed possible so far as concerns the syntax (Ges. 147, e), but is unlikely as being ambiguous and confusing in expression. It is also to be inferred from the correspondence between &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; &#1500;&#1498; and the formula of an oath &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;,    <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-22.htm">1 Samuel 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a>, that God is to be thought of as the subject of &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; and &#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;: "what will," or rather, in accordance with the otherwise precative use of the formula and with the petition that here precedes: "what shall He (is He to) give to thee (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>), and what shall He add to thee, thou crafty tongue?" The reciprocal relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> to &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, and of. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> with the superadding &#1506;&#1501; to &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, shows that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> is not now a characterizing of the tongue that continues the apostrophe to it, as Ewald supposes. Consequently <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> gives the answer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a> with the twofold punishment which Jahve will cause the false tongue to feel. The question which the poet, sure of the answering of his cry for help, puts to the false tongue is designed to let the person addressed hear by a flight of sarcasm what he has to expect. The evil tongue is a sharp sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>), a pointed arrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>), and it is like a fire kindled of hell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>). The punishment, too, corresponds to this its nature and conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-4.htm">Psalm 64:4</a>). The "mighty one" (lxx &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) is God Himself, as it is observed in B. Erachin 15b with a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a> : "There is none mighty by the Holy One, blessed is He." He requites the evil tongue like with like. Arrows and coals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a>) appear also in other instances among His means of punishment. It, which shot piercing arrows, is pierced by the sharpened arrows of an irresistibly mighty One; it, which set its neighbour in a fever of anguish, must endure the lasting, sure, and torturingly consuming heat of broom-coals. The lxx renders it in a general sense, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;; Aquila, following Jewish tradition, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; but &#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, Arabic ratam, ratem, is the broom-shrub (e.g., uncommonly frequent in the Belka&#770;). </body></html>
