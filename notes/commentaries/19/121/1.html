Whence comes my help? </span>The hills are those on which Jerusalem is built, the plural being understood, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-1.htm" title="His foundation is in the holy mountains.">Psalm 87:1</a>. (See Note.) This gaze of hope does not absolutely decide the standpoint of the poet. He might have been like Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-2.htm" title="Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,">Ezekiel 6:2</a>) when bidden to turn “towards the mountains of Israel” in the distant plain of Mesopotamia; or he may have been close on the end of the pilgrim journey, and actually under the sacred hills. But wherever he stands, this question is not one of doubt; he knows, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-4.htm" title="I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.">Psalm 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a>, that help will come from God’s holy hill “out of Zion.” He puts the question for the sake of the emphatic answer in the next verse. Possibly, as suggested by the marginal rendering and reference, the poet may in his mind have been contrasting the confidence with which a worshipper of Jehovah might look up to the sacred city on the crest of the holy hill with that superstition and idolatry which was associated with so many hills and high places in Canaan. If this is so, the best commentary, both on the poetry and the religion of the psalm, is to be found in Mr. Ruskin’s fascinating discourses on mountains in “Modern Painters,” their influence on the ancient, mediaeval, and modern mind, and the part they have played alike in the mythology of the pagan times and the religion of the Christian world. There must also be added, in connection with the feeling of the Jew, the part his mountains played as a barrier of defence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm" title="As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.">Psalm 125:2</a>), and as heights of observation from which to watch for the messengers of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm" title="How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace; that brings good tidings of good, that publishes salvation; that said to Zion, Your God reigns!">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-15.htm" title="Behold on the mountains the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace!

If that be so, we get an appropriate background and setting for the expressions and emotions of this psalm. We see the exile, wearied with the monotony of the long-stretching, flat plains of Babylonia, summoning up before his mind the distant hills where his home was. We see him wondering how he will be able ever to reach that place where his desires are set; and we see him settling down, in hopeful assurance that his effort is not in vain, since his help comes from the Lord. ‘I will lift up my eyes unto the hills’; away out yonder westwards, across the sands, lie the lofty summits of my fatherland that draws me to itself. Then comes a turn of thought, most natural to a mind passionately yearning after a great hope, the very greatness of which makes it hard to keep constant. For the second clause of my text cannot possibly be, as it is translated in our Authorised Version, an affirmation, but must be taken as the Revised Version correctly gives it, a question: ‘I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills. From whence cometh my help?’ How am I to get there? And then comes the final turn of thought: ‘My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So then, there are three things here-the look of longing, the question of weakness, the assurance of faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The look of longing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills’-a resolution, and a resolution born of intense longing. Now the hills that the Psalmist is thinking about were visible from no part of that long-extended plain where he dwelt; and he might have looked till he wore his eyes out, ere he could have seen them on the horizon of sense. But although they were unseen, they were visible to the heart that longed for them. He directs his desires further than the vision of his eyeballs can go. Just as his possible contemporary, Daniel, when he prayed, opened his window towards the Jerusalem that was so far away; and just as Mohammedans still, in every part of the world, when they pray, turn their faces to the <span class="ital">Kaabah</span> at Mecca, the sacred place to which their prayers are directed; and just as many Jews still, north, east, south or west though they be, face Jerusalem when they offer their supplications-so this psalmist in Babylon, wearied and sick of the low levels that stretched endlessly and monotonously round about him, says, ‘I will look at the things that I cannot see, and lift up my eyes above these lownesses about me, to the loftinesses that sense cannot behold, but which I know to be lying serene and solid beyond the narrowing horizon before me.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There was the look of longing, and the longing which made non-vision into a look; and there was the effort to divert his attention from the things around him to the things afar off; and there was the realisation, by reason of the effort, of these distant but most certain realities.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now this Psalmist’s home-sickness, if I may so call it, had nothing at all religious about it. It was simply that he wanted to get to his own country-his own, though he had been born in exile; and there was nothing more devout or spiritual or refining about his longing than there is about the wish to return to his native country that any foreigner in a distant land feels. But when we take these words, as we all ought to do, as the motto of our lives, we must necessarily attach the loftiest religious meaning to them. And here start up the plain, simple, but tight-gripping and stimulating questions, ‘Do I see the Unseen? Does that far-off, dim land assume substance and reality to me? Do I walk in the light of it raying out to me through earth’s darkness? Do I dwell contented with never a glimpse of it?’ It comes to be a very sharp question with us professing Christians, whether the horizon of our inward being is limited by, and coterminous with, the horizon of our senses, or whether, far beyond the narrow limits to which these can reach, our spirits’ desire stretches boundless. Are, to us, the things unseen the solid things, and the things visible the shadows and the phantoms? The Apocalyptic seer, in his rocky Patmos, was told that he was to be shown ‘the things which <span class="ital">are</span>’; and what was it that he saw? A set of what people call unreal and symbolic visions. ‘The things which are,’ the world would have said, ‘are the rocks that you are standing on, and the sea that is dashing upon them, and all the solid-seeming Roman world, and the power that has got you in its grip. These are the realities, and these things that you think you see, these are the dreams.’ But it is exactly the other way. The world and all that is about us, Manchester and its hubbub, warehouses crammed with cloth, and mills full of jennies and throstles-these are the shadows; and the things that only the believing eye beholds, that are wrapped in the invisibility of their own greatness, these, and these only, are the realities. We see with the bodily eyes the shadows on the wall, as it were, but we have to turn round and see with the eyes of our minds the light that flings the shadows. ‘I will lift up my eyes’ from the mud-flats where I live to the hills that I cannot see, and, seeing them, I shall be blessed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Further, do we know anything of that longing that the Psalmist had? He was perfectly comfortable in Babylon. There was abundance of everything that he wanted for his life. The Jews there were materially quite as well off, and many of them a great deal better off, than ever they had been in their narrow little strip of mountain land, shut in between the desert and the sea. But for all that, fat, wealthy Babylon was not Palestine. So amidst the lush vegetation, the wealth of water and the fertile plains, the Psalmist longed for the mountains, though the mountains are often bare of green things. It was that longing that led to his looking to the hills. Do we know anything of that longing which makes us ‘that are in this tabernacle to groan, being burdened’? ‘Absent from the Lord,’ and ‘present in the body,’ we should not be at ease, nor at home. Unless our Christianity throws us out of harmony and contentment with the present, it is worth very little. And unless we know something of that immortal longing to be nearer to God, and fuller of Christ, and emancipated from sense, and from the burdens and trivialities of life, we have yet to learn what the meaning of ‘walking not after the flesh but after the Spirit’ really is.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Further, do we make any effort like that of this Psalmist, who encourages and stimulates himself by that strong ‘I <span class="ital">will</span> lift up my eyes’? You will not do it unless you make a dead lift of effort. It is a great deal easier for a man to look at what is at his feet than to crane his neck gazing at the stars.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And so, unless we take up and persevere in maintaining a habitual attitude of stirring up and lifting up ourselves, gravitation will be too much for us, and down will go the head, and down the eyes; and down will go the desires, and we shall be like men that live in some mountainous country, who never lift their gaze to the solemn white summits that travellers come across half Europe to see. Christian men and women too often walk beneath the very peaks of the mountains of God, and rarely lift their vision there. They perhaps do so for an hour and a half on a Sunday morning, or an hour on a Wednesday evening, when there is no other engagement, or for a minute or two in the morning before they hurry down to breakfast, or a minute or two at night when they are dead beat and unfit for anything. For the rest of the time, <span class="ital">there</span> are the mountains and <span class="ital">here</span> is the saint, and he seldom or never turns his head to look at them! Is that the sort of Christianity that is likely to be a power in the world, or a blessing to its possessor?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II Further, notice the question of weakness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘From whence cometh my help?’ The loftier our ideal, the more painful ought to be our conviction of incapacity to reach it. The Christian man’s one security is in feeling his peril, and the condition of his strength is his acknowledgment and vivid consciousness always of his weakness. The exile in Babylon had a dreary desert, peopled by wild Arab tribes hostile to him, stretching between his present home and that where he desired to be, and it would be difficult for him to get away from the dominion that held him captive, unless by consent of the power of whom he was the vassal. So the more the thought of the mountains of Israel drew the Psalmist, the more there came into his mind the thought, ‘How am I to be made able to reach that blessed soil?’ And surely, if <span class="ital">we</span> saw, with anything like a worthy apprehension and vision, the greatness of that blessedness that lies yonder for Christian souls, we should feel far more deeply than we do the impossibility, as far as we are concerned, of our ever reaching it. The sense of our own weakness and the consciousness of the perils upon the path ought ever to be present with us all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Brethren! if, on the one hand, we have to cultivate, for a healthy, vital Christianity, a vision of the mountains of God, on the other hand we have to try to deepen in ourselves the wholesome sense of our own impotence, and the conviction that the dangers on the road are far too great for us to deal with. ‘Blessed is the man that feareth always.’ ‘Pride goeth before destruction.’ Remember the Franco-German war, and how the French Prime Minister said that they were going into it ‘with a light heart,’ and how some of the troops went out of Paris in railway carriages labelled ‘for Berlin’; and when they reached the frontier they were doubled up and crushed in a month. Unless we, when we set ourselves to this warfare, feel the formidableness of the enemy and recognise the weakness of our own arms, there is nothing but defeat for us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Finally, notice the assurance of faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Psalmist asks himself, ‘From whence cometh my help?’ and then the better self answers the questioning, timid self: ‘My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.’ There will be no reception of the divine help unless there is a sense of the need of the divine help. God cannot help me before I am brought to despair of any other help. It is only when a man says, ‘There is none other that fighteth for us, but only Thou, O God!’ that God comes to help.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is a story in the Book of Chronicles, about one battle in which Judah engaged, of a very singular kind. The first step in the campaign was that the king of Judah gathered all his people together, and prayed to God, and said, ‘We know not what we shall do. We have no strength against this great multitude that cometh against us, but our eyes are unto Thee.’ Then a prophet came and assured him of victory, and next day they arrayed the battle. It was set in this strange fashion: in the forefront were put the priests and Levites, with their instruments of music, and not soldiers with spears and bows, and they marched out to battle with this song, ‘The Lord is gracious and merciful. His mercy endureth for ever.’ Then, without the stroke of sword or thrust of spear, God fought for them and scattered their foes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Which things are an allegory.’ If we recognise our helplessness, God is our help. If we conceit ourselves to be strong, we are weak; if we know ourselves to be impotent, Omnipotence pours itself into us. We read once that Jesus Christ healed ‘them that had need of healing.’ Why does the Evangelist not say, without that periphrasis, ‘healed the sick’? Because he would emphasise, I suppose, amongst other things, the thought that only the sense of need fits for the reception of healing and help.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If, then, we desire that God should be ‘the Strength of our hearts, and our Portion for ever,’ the coming of His help must be wooed and won by our sense of our own impotence, and only they who say, ‘We have no might against this great multitude that cometh against us,’ will ever hear from Him the blessed assurance, ‘The Lord will fight for you.’ ‘Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord!’ So, brethren! the assurance of faith follows the consciousness of weakness, and both together will lead, and nothing else will lead, to the realisation of the vision of faith, and bring us at last, weak as we are, to the hills where the weary and foot-sore flock ‘shall lie down in a good fold, and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/121.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/121-1.htm" title="I will lift up my eyes to the hills, from where comes my help....">Psalm 121:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills </span>— To Zion and Moriah, called the holy mountains, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-1.htm" title="His foundation is in the holy mountains.">Psalm 87:1</a>, the hills on which the tabernacle or temple stood, where were the ark of the covenant, the oracle, and the altars.

Shall I depend upon the strength of the hills? upon princes and great men? No; my confidence is in God only. Or, we must lift up our eyes above the hills; we must look to God who makes all earthly things to us what they are. We must see all our help in God; from him we must expect it, in his own way and time. This psalm teaches us to comfort ourselves in the Lord, when difficulties and dangers are greatest. It is almighty wisdom that contrives, and almighty power that works the safety of those that put themselves under God's protection. He is a wakeful, watchful Keeper; he is never weary; he not only does not sleep, but he does not so much as slumber. Under this shade they may sit with delight and assurance. He is always near his people for their protection and refreshment. The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn to their duty, and they shall find God ready to give them success. He will take care that his people shall not fall. Thou shalt not be hurt, neither by the open assaults, nor by the secret attempts of thine enemies. The Lord shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and sanctify, remove, or lighten the evil thou feelest. He will preserve the soul, that it be not defiled by sin, and disturbed by affliction; he will preserve it from perishing eternally. He will keep thee in life and death; going out to thy labour in the morning of thy days, and coming home to thy rest when the evening of old age calls thee in. It is a protection for life. The Spirit, who is their Preserver and Comforter, shall abide with them for ever. Let us be found in our work, assured that the blessings promised in this psalm are ours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/121.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will lift up mine eyes - Margin, "Shall I lift up mine eyes to the hills? Whence should my help come?" The expression would properly denote a condition where there was danger; when no help or aid was visible; and when the eyes were turned to the quarter from which help might be expected to come. What the danger was cannot now be ascertained.<p>Unto the hills - Hebrew, the mountains. To the quarter from where I look for assistance. This (as has been shown in the Introduction) may refer<p>(1) to the mountains from where one in danger expected help; or<p>(2) to heaven, considered as high, and as the abode of God; or<p>(3) to the hills on which Jerusalem was built, as the place where God dwelt, and from where aid was expected.<p>The third of these is the most probable. The first would be applicable to a state of war only, and the second is forced and unnatural. Adopting the third interpretation, the language is natural, and makes it proper to be used at all times, since it indicates a proper looking to God as he manifests himself to people, particularly in the church.<p>From whence cometh my help - A more literal rendering would be, "Whence cometh my help?" This accords best with the usage of the Hebrew word, and agrees well with the connection. It indicates a troubled and anxious state of mind - a mind that asks, Where shall I look for help? The answer is found in the following verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/121.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 121<p>Ps 121:1-8.

It is wise to look to the strong for strength. Dwellers in valleys are subject to many disorders for which there is no cure but a sojourn in the uplands, and it is well when they shake off their lethargy and resolve upon a climb. Down below they are the prey of marauders, and to escape from them the surest method is to fly to the strongholds upon the mountains. Often before the actual ascent the sick and plundered people looked towards the hills and longed to be upon their summits. The holy man who here sings a choice sonnet looked away from the slanderers by whom he was tormented to the Lord who saw all from his high places, and was ready to pour down succour for his injured servant. Help comes to saints only from above, they look elsewhere in vain, let us lift up our eyes with hope, expectancy, desire and confidence. Satan will endeavour to keep our eyes upon our sorrows that we may be disquieted and discouraged; be it ours firmly to resolve that we will look out and look up, for there is good cheer for the eyes, and they that lift up their eyes to the eternal hills shall soon have their hearts lifted up also. The purposes of God; the divine attributes; the immutable promises; the covenant, ordered in all things and sure; the providence, predestination, and proved faithfulness of the Lord - these are the hills to which we must lift our eyes, for from these our help must come. It is our resolve that we will not be bandaged and blindfolded, but will lift up our eyes.<p>Or is the text in the interrogative? Dose he ask, "Shall I lift up mine eyes to the hills?" Does he feel that the highest places of the earth can afford him no shelter? Or does he renounce the idea of recruits hastening to his standard from the hardy mountaineers? and hence does he again enquire, "Whence cometh my help?" If so, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a> answers the question, and shows whence all help must come.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a><p>"My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth." What we need is help, - help powerful, efficient, constant, we need a very present help in trouble. What a mercy that we have it in our God. Our hope is in Jehovah, for our help comes from him. Help is on the road, and will not fail to reach us in due time, for he who sends it to us was never known to be too late. Jehovah who created all things is equal to every emergency; heaven and earth are at the disposal of him who made them, therefore let us be very joyful in our infinite helper. He will sooner destroy heaven and earth than permit his people to be destroyed, and the perpetual hills themselves shall bow rather than he shall fail whose ways are everlasting. We are bound to look beyond heaven and earth to him who made them both, it is vain to trust the creatures' it is wise to trust the Creator.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a><p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The matter of this Psalm sufficiently showeth that the psalmist was conflicting with great difficulties and oppositions, and looking. hither and thither for help, as men in such cases use to do, and then turning his eyes to God and his providence, and encouraging himself by God’s promises made to his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The psalmist showeth that the great safety of the godly is from the Lord, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/121-1.htm" title="I will lift up my eyes to the hills, from where comes my help....">Psalm 121:1-5</a></span>, who keepeth them in their outgoings and incomings from all evil, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/121-6.htm" title="The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night....">Psalm 121:6-8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">Unto the hills; </span> either to Zion and Moriah, which are called <span class="ital">the holy mountains</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-1.htm" title="His foundation is in the holy mountains.">Psalm 87:1</a></span>; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

The lifting up of the eyes is a prayer gesture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41</a>; and is expressive of boldness and confidence in prayer, and of hope and expectation of help and salvation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15</a>; when, on the contrary, persons abashed and ashamed, hopeless and helpless, cannot look up, or lift up their eyes or face to God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>.

The question of the second line (which cannot be taken as a relative clause) is not one of doubt or despondency, but is simply asked to introduce the answer which follows in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-2.htm" title="My help comes from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.">Psalm 121:2</a></span>. That answer gives a deeper turn to the thought of the question. It is not from the mountains of Zion, but from Jehovah Who has fixed His earthly dwelling-place there that help comes.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/121.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills</span>.

For the petition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a> manifestly arises out of his deplorable situation, which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>. Nevertheless there are also other instances in which &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; might have been expected, where the pointing is &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>), so that consequently &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; may, without any prejudice to the pointing, be taken as a believing expression of the result (cf. the future of the consequence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-16.htm">Job 9:16</a>) of the present cry for help. &#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492;, according to the original signification, is a form of the definition of a state or condition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-27.htm">Psalm 44:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/2-10.htm">Jonah 2:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>, is based upon the customary expression &#1510;&#1512; &#1500;&#1468;&#1497;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-2.htm">Psalm 120:2</a> follows the petition which the poet sends up to Jahve in the certainty of being answered. &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; beside &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, although there is no masc. &#1512;&#1502;&#1497; (cf. however the Aramaic &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;), is taken as an adjective after the form &#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which it is also perhaps in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a>. The parallelism would make &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; natural, like &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a>; the pointing, which nevertheless disregarded this, will therefore rest upon tradition. The apostrophe in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a> is addressed to the crafty tongue. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; is certainly feminine as a rule; but whilst the tongue as such is feminine, the &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; of the address, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6</a>, refers to him who has such a kind of tongue (cf. Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a>), and thereby the &#1500;&#1498; is justified; whereas the rendering, "what does it bring to thee, and what does it profit thee?" or, "of what use to thee and what advancement to thee is the crafty tongue?" is indeed possible so far as concerns the syntax (Ges. 147, e), but is unlikely as being ambiguous and confusing in expression. It is also to be inferred from the correspondence between &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; &#1500;&#1498; and the formula of an oath &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1497;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;,    <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-22.htm">1 Samuel 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a>, that God is to be thought of as the subject of &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; and &#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;: "what will," or rather, in accordance with the otherwise precative use of the formula and with the petition that here precedes: "what shall He (is He to) give to thee (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>), and what shall He add to thee, thou crafty tongue?" The reciprocal relation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> to &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, and of. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> with the superadding &#1506;&#1501; to &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;, shows that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> is not now a characterizing of the tongue that continues the apostrophe to it, as Ewald supposes. Consequently <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a> gives the answer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a> with the twofold punishment which Jahve will cause the false tongue to feel. The question which the poet, sure of the answering of his cry for help, puts to the false tongue is designed to let the person addressed hear by a flight of sarcasm what he has to expect. The evil tongue is a sharp sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5</a>), a pointed arrow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>), and it is like a fire kindled of hell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>). The punishment, too, corresponds to this its nature and conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-4.htm">Psalm 64:4</a>). The "mighty one" (lxx &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) is God Himself, as it is observed in B. Erachin 15b with a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a> : "There is none mighty by the Holy One, blessed is He." He requites the evil tongue like with like. Arrows and coals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a>) appear also in other instances among His means of punishment. It, which shot piercing arrows, is pierced by the sharpened arrows of an irresistibly mighty One; it, which set its neighbour in a fever of anguish, must endure the lasting, sure, and torturingly consuming heat of broom-coals. The lxx renders it in a general sense, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;; Aquila, following Jewish tradition, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; but &#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, Arabic ratam, ratem, is the broom-shrub (e.g., uncommonly frequent in the Belka&#770;). </body></html>
