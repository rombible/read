Shall I depend upon the strength of the hills? upon princes and great men? No; my confidence is in God only. Or, we must lift up our eyes above the hills; we must look to God who makes all earthly things to us what they are. We must see all our help in God; from him we must expect it, in his own way and time. This psalm teaches us to comfort ourselves in the Lord, when difficulties and dangers are greatest. It is almighty wisdom that contrives, and almighty power that works the safety of those that put themselves under God's protection. He is a wakeful, watchful Keeper; he is never weary; he not only does not sleep, but he does not so much as slumber. Under this shade they may sit with delight and assurance. He is always near his people for their protection and refreshment. The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn to their duty, and they shall find God ready to give them success. He will take care that his people shall not fall. Thou shalt not be hurt, neither by the open assaults, nor by the secret attempts of thine enemies. The Lord shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and sanctify, remove, or lighten the evil thou feelest. He will preserve the soul, that it be not defiled by sin, and disturbed by affliction; he will preserve it from perishing eternally. He will keep thee in life and death; going out to thy labour in the morning of thy days, and coming home to thy rest when the evening of old age calls thee in. It is a protection for life. The Spirit, who is their Preserver and Comforter, shall abide with them for ever. Let us be found in our work, assured that the blessings promised in this psalm are ours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/121.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil - This is an advance of the thought. The psalmist had in the previous verses specified some particular evils from which he says God would keep those who put their trust in him. He now makes the remark general, and says that God would not only preserve from these particular evils, but would keep those who trusted in him from all evil: he would be their Protector in all the perils of life.<p>He shall preserve thy soul - Thy life.

The Word of the Lord, as the Targum. Not from the evil of affliction, though from that as a penal evil; or as a real one, it being made to work for good: but from the evil of sin; not from the being or commission of it; but from its dominion and damning power, or from a final and total falling away by it: and from the evil of the world; not from tribulation in it, nor from the reproach or persecution of it; but from the wickedness and lusts that are in it, and from the wicked men of it, their power, rage, and fury: and from the evil one, Satan; not from his temptations, but from sinking under them, and perishing by them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>; <p>he shall preserve thy soul: he preserves the bodies of his people, oftentimes from diseases and disasters, and from death, till the appointed time comes; and then he preserves their dust in the grave, and raises it up at the last day; but more especially their souls, the redemption and salvation of which he undertook, and has effected; and which are preserved by him safe to his coming, kingdom, and glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/121.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/121.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>.

The expression in fact is &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, and not &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;. And the mountains towards which the psalmist raises his eyes are not any mountains whatsoever. In Ezekiel the designation of his native land from the standpoint of the Mesopotamian plain is "the mountains of Israel." His longing gaze is directed towards the district of these mountains, they are his k&#803;ibla, i.e., the sight-point of his prayer, as of Daniel's, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-11.htm">Daniel 6:11</a>. To render "from which my help cometh" (Luther) is inadmissible. &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is an interrogative even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4</a>, where the question is an indirect one. The poet looks up to the mountains, the mountains of his native land, the holy mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>), when he longingly asks: whence will my help come? and to this question his longing desire itself returns the answer, that his help comes from no other quarter than from Jahve, the Maker of heaven and earth, from His who sits enthroned behind and upon these mountains, whose helpful power reaches to the remotest ends and corners of His creation, and with (&#1506;&#1501;) whom is help, i.e., both the willingness and the power to help, so that therefore help comes from nowhere but from (&#1502;&#1503;) Him alone. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a> the poet has propounded a question, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a> replies to this question himself. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a> and further the answering one goes on speaking to the questioner. The poet is himself become objective, and his Ego, calm in God, promises him comfort, by unfolding to him the joyful prospects contained in that hope in Jahve. The subjective &#1488;&#1500; expresses a negative in both cases with an emotional rejection of that which is absolutely impossible. The poet says to himself: He will, indeed, surely not abandon thy foot to the tottering (&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1496;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>), thy Keeper will surely not slumber; and then confirms the assertion that this shall not come to pass by heightening the expression in accordance with the step-like character of the Psalm: Behold the Keeper of Israel slumbereth not and sleepeth not, i.e., He does not fall into slumber from weariness, and His life is not an alternate waking and sleeping. The eyes of His providence are ever open over Israel. </body></html>
