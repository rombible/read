God's way is in the sanctuary. We are sure that God is holy in all his works. God's ways are like the deep waters, which cannot be fathomed; like the way of a ship, which cannot be tracked. God brought Israel out of Egypt. This was typical of the great redemption to be wrought out in the fulness of time, both by price and power. If we have harboured doubtful thoughts, we should, without delay, turn our minds to meditate on that God, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, that with him, he might freely give us all things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/77.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary - Luther renders this, "O God, thy way is holy." Prof. Alexander, "O God, in holiness is thy way." DeWette, "O God, holy is thy way." The word rendered "sanctuary" - &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  qo&#770;desh - means properly "holiness." It is not the same word which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a> is rendered "sanctuary" - &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  miqda&#770;sh. The word here employed, however, may mean a holy place, a sanctuary, as the tabernacle <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>, or the temple <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>. In this passage the word is ambiguous. It means either that the way of God is holy, or in holiness; or, that it is in the sanctuary, or holy place. If the former, it is a statement of the result to which the psalmist came in regard to the divine character, from a contemplation of his doings. If the latter, it means that the way of God - the true principles of the divine administration - are to be learned in the place where he is worshipped, and from the principles which are there set forth. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>. It seems to me that the former is the correct interpretation, as it accords better with the scope of the passage.<p>Who is so great a God as our God - In greatness no one can be compared with him. He is supreme over all. This is the first reflection of the psalmist in regard to God - that he is great; that he is superior to all other beings; that no one can be compared with him. The evident inference from this in the mind of the psalmist, as bearing on the subject of his inquiry, is, that it is to be expected that there will be things in his administration which man cannot hope to understand; that a rash and sudden judgment should not be formed in regard to him from his doings; that people should wait for the developments of his plans; that he should not be condemned because there are things which we cannot comprehend, or which seem to be inconsistent with goodness. This is a consideration which ought always to influence us in our views of God and his government. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/77.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

He who holds these so that they remain open when they want to shut together for sleep, is God; for his looking up to Him keeps the poet awake in spite of all overstraining of his powers. Hupfeld and others render thus: "Thou hast held, i.e., caused to last, the night-watches of mine eyes," - which is affected in thought and expression. The preterites state what has been hitherto and has not yet come to a close. He still endures, as formerly, such thumps and blows within him, as though he lay upon an anvil (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501;), and his voice fails him. Then silent soliloquy takes the place of audible prayer; he throws himself back in thought to the days of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-5.htm">Psalm 143:5</a>), the years of past periods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>), which were so rich in the proofs of the power and loving-kindness of the God who was then manifest, but is now hidden. He remembers the happier past of his people and his own, inasmuch as he now in the night purposely calls back to himself in his mind the time when joyful thankfulness impelled him to the song of praise accompanied by the music of the harp (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; belongs according to the accents to the verb, not to &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;, although that construction certainly is strongly commended by parallel passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>), in place of which, crying and sighing and gloomy silence have now entered. He gives himself up to musing "with his heart," i.e., in the retirement of his inmost nature, inasmuch as he allows his thoughts incessantly to hover to and fro between the present and the former days, and in consequence of this (fut. consec. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>) his spirit betakes itself to scrupulizing (what the lxx reproduces with &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, Aquila with &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) - his conflict of temptation grows fiercer. Now follow the two doubting questions of the tempted one: he asks in different applications, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-8.htm">Psalm 77:8-10</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-6.htm">Psalm 85:6</a>), whether it is then all at an end with God's loving-kindness and promise, at the same time saying to himself, that this nevertheless is at variance with the unchangeableness of His nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>) and the inviolability of His covenant. &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; (only occurring as a 3. praet.) alternates with &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>). &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is an infinitive construct formed after the manner of the Lamed He verbs, which, however, does also occur as infinitive absolute (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>, cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>); Gesenius and Olshausen (who doubts this infinitive form, 245, f) explain it, as do Aben-Ezra and Kimchi, as the plural of a substantive &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, but in the passage cited from Ezekiel (vid., Hitzig) such a substantival plural is syntactically impossible. &#1511;&#1508;&#1509; &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to draw together or contract and draw back one's compassion, so that it does not manifest itself outwardly, just as he who will not give shuts (&#1497;&#1511;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509;) his hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>; cf. supra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-10.htm">Psalm 17:10</a>). </body></html>
