In the day of his trouble the psalmist did not seek for the diversion of business or amusement, but he sought God, and his favor and grace. Those that are under trouble of mind, must pray it away. He pored upon the trouble; the methods that should have relieved him did but increase his grief. When he remembered God, it was only the Divine justice and wrath. His spirit was overwhelmed, and sank under the load. But let not the remembrance of the comforts we have lost, make us unthankful for those that are left. Particularly he called to remembrance the comforts with which he supported himself in former sorrows. Here is the language of a sorrowful, deserted soul, walking in darkness; a common case even among those that fear the Lord, Isa 50:10. Nothing wounds and pierces like the thought of God's being angry. God's own people, in a cloudy and dark day, may be tempted to make wrong conclusions about their spiritual state, and that of God's kingdom in the world. But we must not give way to such fears. Let faith answer them from the Scripture. The troubled fountain will work itself clear again; and the recollection of former times of joyful experience often raises a hope, tending to relief. Doubts and fears proceed from the want and weakness of faith. Despondency and distrust under affliction, are too often the infirmities of believers, and, as such, are to be thought upon by us with sorrow and shame. When, unbelief is working in us, we must thus suppress its risings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/77.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I call to remembrance my song in the night - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>, note.

The idea is, that there had been times in his life when, even in darkness and sorrow, he could sing; when he could find things for which to praise God; when he could find something that would cheer him; when he could take some bright views of God adapted to calm down his feelings, and to give peace to his soul. He recalls those times and scenes to his remembrance, with a desire to have those cheerful impressions renewed; and he asks himself what it was which then comforted and sustained him. He endeavors to bring those things back again, for if he found comfort then, he thinks that he might find comfort from the same considerations now.<p>I commune with mine own heart - I think over the matter.

The rage of men shall praise Thee, i.e., must ultimately redound to Thy glory, inasmuch as to Thee, namely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-1.htm">Psalm 76:1</a> as to syntax like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a>), there always remains a &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, i.e., a still unexhausted remainder, and that not merely of &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, but of &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;, with which Thou canst gird, i.e., arm, Thyself against such human rage, in order to quench it. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; is the infinite store of wrath still available to God after human rage has done its utmost. Or perhaps still better, and more fully answering to the notion of &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;: it is the store of the infinite fulness of wrath which still remains on the side of God after human rage (&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;) has spent itself, when God calmly, and laughing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>), allows the Titans to do as they please, and which is now being poured out. In connection with the interpretation: with the remainder of the fury (of hostile men) wilt Thou gird Thyself, i.e., it serves Thee only as an ornament (Hupfeld), the alternation of &#1495;&#1502;&#1492; and &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; is left unexplained, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512; is alienated from its martial sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>, Wisd. 5:21 [20]), which is required by the context. Ewald, like the lxx, reads &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1490;&#1468;&#1498;, &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, in connection with which, apart from the high-sounding expression, &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) must denote the remainder of malignity that is suddenly converted into its opposite; and one does not see why what <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-11.htm">Psalm 76:11</a> says concerning rage is here limited to its remainder. Such an inexhaustiveness in the divine wrath-power has been shown in what has just recently been experienced. Thus, then, are those who belong to the people of God to vow and pay, i.e., (inasmuch as the preponderance falls upon the second imperative) to pay their vows; and all who are round about Him, i.e., all the peoples dwelling round about Him and His people (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;, the subject to what follows, in accordance with which it is also accented), are to bring offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>) to God, who is &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;, i.e., the sum of all that is awe-inspiring. Thus is He called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; the summons accords with Isaiah's prediction, according to which, in consequence of Jahve's deed of judgment upon Assyria, Aethiopia presents himself to Him as an offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1-7</a>), and with the fulfilment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>. Just so does v. 13a resemble the language of Isaiah; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a> : God treats the snorting of the princes, i.e., despots, as the vine-dresser does the wild shoots or branches of the vine-stock: He lops it, He cuts it off, so that it is altogether ineffectual. It is the figure that is sketched by <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>, then filled in by Isaiah, and embodied as a vision in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-17.htm">Revelation 14:17-20</a>, which is here indicated. God puts an end to the defiant, arrogant bearing of the tyrants of the earth, and becomes at last the feared of all the kings of the earth - all kingdoms finally becomes God's and His Christ's. </body></html>
