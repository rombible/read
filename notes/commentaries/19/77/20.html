The Psalm concludes abruptly, and does not apply those ancient instances of God’s power to the present distresses, whether personal or national, as one might have expected. For as soon as the good man began to meditate on these things he found he had gained his point. His very entrance upon this matter gave him light and joy; his fears suddenly and strangely vanished, so that he needed to go no further; <span class="ital">he went his way and did eat, and his countenance was no more sad.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/77.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>77:11-20 The remembrance of the works of God, will be a powerful remedy against distrust of his promise and goodness; for he is God, and changes not. God's way is in the sanctuary. We are sure that God is holy in all his works. God's ways are like the deep waters, which cannot be fathomed; like the way of a ship, which cannot be tracked. God brought Israel out of Egypt. This was typical of the great redemption to be wrought out in the fulness of time, both by price and power. If we have harboured doubtful thoughts, we should, without delay, turn our minds to meditate on that God, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, that with him, he might freely give us all things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/77.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron - This satisfied and comforted the mind of the psalmist. God had never forsaken his people. He had shown himself faithful in his dealings with them. He had acted the part of a good shepherd. In all the dangers of their way; in their perilous journey through the wilderness; amidst foes, privations, and troubles - rocks, sands, storms, tempests - when surrounded by enemies, and when their camp was infested with poisonous serpents - God had shown himself able to protect his people, and had been faithful to all his promises and covenant-engagements. Looking back to this period of their history, the psalmist saw that there was abundant reason for confiding in God, and that the mind should repose on him calmly amid all that was dark and mysterious in his dealings. In view of the past, the mind ought to be calm; encouraged by the past, however incomprehensible may be God's doings, people may come to him, and entrust all their interests to him with the confident assurance that their salvation will be secure, and that all which seems dark and mysterious in the dealings of God will yet be made clear. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/77.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. waters &#8230; , footsteps&#8212;may refer to His actual leading the people through the sea, though also expressing the mysteries of providence.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/77.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou leddest thy people; </span> first through the sea, and afterwards through the vast howling wilderness to Canaan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like a flock; </span> with singular care and tenderness, as a shepherd doth his sheep.

Either through the Red sea, according to R. Moses Hacohen, as Aben Ezra observes; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>, or rather, as he and Kimchi, through the wilderness, after they were led through the sea; the people of Israel are compared to a flock of sheep; the Lord is represented as the Shepherd of them, who took care of them, protected and preserved them from their enemies: <p>by the hand of Moses and Aaron; the one was their civil and the other their ecclesiastical governor, and both under the Lord, and instruments of his, in guiding and conducting the people in all things needful for them. The Arabic version adds, "Allelujah"; from all this the psalmist concluded, though it is not mentioned, that as God had delivered his people of old out of their straits and difficulties, so he hoped and believed, that as he could, he would deliver him in his own time and way; and by this means his faith was relieved and strengthened. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/77.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/77.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>.

In the rendering of &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (with the tone regularly drawn back before the following monosyllable) even the Targum wavers between &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (my affliction) and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (my supplication); and just in the same way, in the rendering of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>, between &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; (have changed) and &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (years). &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; cannot possibly signify "change" in an active sense, as Luther renders: "The right hand of the Most High can change everything," but only a having become different (lxx and the Quinta &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), after which Maurer, Hupfeld, and Hitzig render thus: my affliction is this, that the right hand of the Most High has changed. But after we have read &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-6.htm">Psalm 77:6</a> as a poetical plural of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, a year, we have first of all to see whether it may not have the same signification here. And many possible interpretations present themselves. It can be interpreted: "my supplication is this: years of the right hand of the Most High" (viz., that years like to the former ones may be renewed); but this thought is not suited to the introduction with &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. We must either interpret it: my sickness, viz., from the side of God, i.e., the temptation which befalls me from Him, the affliction ordained by Him for me (Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), is this (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>); or, since in this case the unambiguous &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; would have been used instead of the Piel: my being pierced, my wounding, my sorrow is this (Symmachus &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, inf. Kal from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm">Psalm 109:22</a>, after the form &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;) - they are years of the right hand of the Most High, i.e., those which God's mighty hand, under which I have to humble myself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>), has formed and measured out to me. In connection with this way of taking <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> is now suitably and easily attached to what has gone before. The poet says to himself that the affliction allotted to him has its time, and will not last for ever. Therein lies a hope which makes the retrospective glance into the happier past a source of consolation to him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> the Chethb &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; is to be retained, for the &#1499;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> is thus best explained: "I bring to remembrance, i.e., make known with praise or celebrate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>), the deeds of Ja&#772;h, for I will remember Thy wondrous doing from days of old." His sorrow over the distance between the present and the past is now mitigated by the hope that God's right hand, which now casts down, will also again in His own time raise up. Therefore he will now, as the advance from the indicative to the cohortative (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>) imports, thoroughly console and refresh himself with God's work of salvation in all its miraculous manifestations from the earliest times. &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; is the most concise and comprehensive appellation for the God of the history of redemption, who, as Habakkuk prays, will revive His work of redemption in the midst of the years to come, and bring it to a glorious issue. To Him who then was and who will yet come the poet now brings praise and celebration. The way of God is His historical rule, and more especially, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, His redemptive rule. The primary passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>) shows that &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is not to be rendered "in the sanctuary" (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;), but "in holiness" (Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;). Holy and glorious in love and in anger. God goes through history, and shows Himself there as the incomparable One, with whose greatness no being, and least of all any one of the beingless gods, can be measured. He is &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, the God, God absolutely and exclusively, a miracle-working (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, not &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1488; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>)<p>(Note: The joining of the second word, accented on the first syllable and closely allied in sense, on to the first, which is accented on the ultima (the tone of which, under certain circumstances, retreats to the penult., &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;) or monosyllabic, by means of the hardening Dagesh (the so-called &#1491;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;), only takes place when that first word ends in  &#1492;- or  &#1492;-, not when it ends in  &#1492;-.))<p>God, and a God who by these very means reveals Himself as the living and supra-mundane God. He has made His omnipotence known among the peoples, viz., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> says, by the redemption of His people, the tribes of Jacob and the double tribe of Joseph, out of Egypt, - a deed of His arm, i.e., the work of His own might, by which He has proved Himself to all peoples and to the whole earth to be the Lord of the world and the God of salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;, brachio scil. extenso (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>, and frequently), just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, collo scil. erecto.
