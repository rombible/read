The Chaldee paraphrast appears to have understood the words thus, rendering them, <span class="ital">The sons which Jacob begat and Joseph nourished. </span>Joseph was indeed a kind of second father, and they might well be called his sons; without whose care, humanly speaking, there had been no such redemption, nor people to be redeemed. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/77.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>77:11-20 The remembrance of the works of God, will be a powerful remedy against distrust of his promise and goodness; for he is God, and changes not. God's way is in the sanctuary. We are sure that God is holy in all his works. God's ways are like the deep waters, which cannot be fathomed; like the way of a ship, which cannot be tracked. God brought Israel out of Egypt. This was typical of the great redemption to be wrought out in the fulness of time, both by price and power. If we have harboured doubtful thoughts, we should, without delay, turn our minds to meditate on that God, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, that with him, he might freely give us all things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/77.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou art the God that doest wonders - It is, it must be, the characteristic of God, the true God, to do wonderful things; things which are suited to produce amazement, and which we can little hope to be able to understand. Our judgment of God, therefore, should not be hasty and rash, but calm and deliberate.<p>Thou hast declared thy strength among the people - Thou hast manifested thy greatness in thy dealings with the people. The word "people" here refers not especially to the Hebrew people, but to the nations - the people of the world at large. On a wide scale, and among all nations, God had done that which was suited to excite wonder, and which people were little qualified as yet to comprehend. No one can judge aright of what another has done unless he can take in the whole subject, and see it as he does who performs the act - unless he understands all the causes, the motives, the results near and remote - unless he sees the necessity of the act - unless he sees what would have been the consequences if it had not been done, for in that which is unknown to us, and which lies beyond the range of our vision, there may be full and sufficient reasons for what has been done, and an explanation may be found there which would remove all the difficulty. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/77.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-20.

He who holds these so that they remain open when they want to shut together for sleep, is God; for his looking up to Him keeps the poet awake in spite of all overstraining of his powers. Hupfeld and others render thus: "Thou hast held, i.e., caused to last, the night-watches of mine eyes," - which is affected in thought and expression. The preterites state what has been hitherto and has not yet come to a close. He still endures, as formerly, such thumps and blows within him, as though he lay upon an anvil (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501;), and his voice fails him. Then silent soliloquy takes the place of audible prayer; he throws himself back in thought to the days of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-5.htm">Psalm 143:5</a>), the years of past periods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>), which were so rich in the proofs of the power and loving-kindness of the God who was then manifest, but is now hidden. He remembers the happier past of his people and his own, inasmuch as he now in the night purposely calls back to himself in his mind the time when joyful thankfulness impelled him to the song of praise accompanied by the music of the harp (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; belongs according to the accents to the verb, not to &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;, although that construction certainly is strongly commended by parallel passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-9.htm">Psalm 42:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>), in place of which, crying and sighing and gloomy silence have now entered. He gives himself up to musing "with his heart," i.e., in the retirement of his inmost nature, inasmuch as he allows his thoughts incessantly to hover to and fro between the present and the former days, and in consequence of this (fut. consec. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>) his spirit betakes itself to scrupulizing (what the lxx reproduces with &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, Aquila with &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) - his conflict of temptation grows fiercer. Now follow the two doubting questions of the tempted one: he asks in different applications, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-8.htm">Psalm 77:8-10</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-6.htm">Psalm 85:6</a>), whether it is then all at an end with God's loving-kindness and promise, at the same time saying to himself, that this nevertheless is at variance with the unchangeableness of His nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>) and the inviolability of His covenant. &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; (only occurring as a 3. praet.) alternates with &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>). &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is an infinitive construct formed after the manner of the Lamed He verbs, which, however, does also occur as infinitive absolute (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>, cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>); Gesenius and Olshausen (who doubts this infinitive form, 245, f) explain it, as do Aben-Ezra and Kimchi, as the plural of a substantive &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, but in the passage cited from Ezekiel (vid., Hitzig) such a substantival plural is syntactically impossible. &#1511;&#1508;&#1509; &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to draw together or contract and draw back one's compassion, so that it does not manifest itself outwardly, just as he who will not give shuts (&#1497;&#1511;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509;) his hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>; cf. supra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-10.htm">Psalm 17:10</a>). </body></html>
