In the day of his trouble the psalmist did not seek for the diversion of business or amusement, but he sought God, and his favor and grace. Those that are under trouble of mind, must pray it away. He pored upon the trouble; the methods that should have relieved him did but increase his grief. When he remembered God, it was only the Divine justice and wrath. His spirit was overwhelmed, and sank under the load. But let not the remembrance of the comforts we have lost, make us unthankful for those that are left. Particularly he called to remembrance the comforts with which he supported himself in former sorrows. Here is the language of a sorrowful, deserted soul, walking in darkness; a common case even among those that fear the Lord, Isa 50:10. Nothing wounds and pierces like the thought of God's being angry. God's own people, in a cloudy and dark day, may be tempted to make wrong conclusions about their spiritual state, and that of God's kingdom in the world. But we must not give way to such fears. Let faith answer them from the Scripture. The troubled fountain will work itself clear again; and the recollection of former times of joyful experience often raises a hope, tending to relief. Doubts and fears proceed from the want and weakness of faith. Despondency and distrust under affliction, are too often the infirmities of believers, and, as such, are to be thought upon by us with sorrow and shame. When, unbelief is working in us, we must thus suppress its risings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/77.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? - Has he passed over mercy in administering his government? Has he ceased to remember that man needs mercy? Has he forgotten that this is an attribute of his own nature?<p>Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? - The original word here rendered "tender mercies" refers to the "bowels," as the seat of compassion or mercy, in accordance with a usage common in Hebrew. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-6.htm">Psalm 25:6</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>, note.

We speak of the "heart" as the seat of affection and kindness. The Hebrews included the heart, but they used a more general word. The word rendered "shut up" means "closed;" and the question is whether his mercy was closed, or had ceased forever. The psalmist concludes that if this were done, it must be as the result of anger - anger in view of the sins of people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/77.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. holdest &#8230; waking&#8212;or, "fast," that I cannot sleep.

According to the pointing, &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; appears to be meant to be imperative after the form &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1500;, which occurs instead of &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500; and &#1492;&#1511;&#1514;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>, and the mode of writing &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-6.htm">2 Kings 8:6</a>, and frequently; therefore et audi  equals  ut audias (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-3.htm">2 Samuel 21:3</a>). But such an isolated form of address is not to be tolerated; &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; has been regarded as perf. consec. in the sense of ut audiat, although this modification of &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; into &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; in connection with the appearing of the Waw consec. cannot be supported in any other instance (Ew. &#1431;234, e), and Kimchi on this account tries to persuade himself to that which is impossible, viz., that &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503; in respect of sound stands for &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1494;&#1497;&#1503;. The preterites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-3.htm">Psalm 77:3</a> express that which has commenced and which will go on. The poet labours in his present time of affliction to press forward to the Lord, who has withdrawn from him; his hand is diffused, i.e., stretched out (not: poured out, for the radical meaning of &#1504;&#1490;&#1512;, as the Syriac shows, is protrahere), in the night-time without wearying and leaving off; it is fixedly and stedfastly (&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, as it is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>) stretched out towards heaven. His soul is comfortless, and all comfort up to the present rebounds as it were from it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>). If he remembers God, who was once near to him, then he is compelled to groan (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>; and on the cohortative form of a Lamed He verb, cf. Ges. &#1431;75, 6), because He has hidden Himself from him; if he muses, in order to find Him again, then his spirit veils itself, i.e., it sinks into night and feebleness (&#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1507; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-5.htm">Psalm 107:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-4.htm">Psalm 142:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-4.htm">Psalm 143:4</a>).
