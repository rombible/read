We know not; we need not know. The obscuring, the mystery, here as elsewhere, was part of the lesson. . . . All that we see distinctly is, that through this dark and terrible night, with the enemy pressing close behind, and the driving sea on either side, He led His people like sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron” (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>i. 128).<p>To some minds the abruptness of the conclusion of the psalm marks it as unfinished. But no better end could have been reached in the poet’s perplexity than that to which he has been led by his musings on the past, the thought of the religious aids ready to his hand, in the faith and worship left by Moses and Aaron. We are reminded of him who recalled the thoughts of the young man, searching for a higher ideal of duty, back to the law and obedience. Or if the psalm is rather an expression of the feeling of the community than of an individual, there is a pointed significance in the conclusion given to all the national cries of doubt and despair—the one safe course was to remain loyal and true to the ancient institutions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/77.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-19.htm" title="Your way is in the sea, and your path in the great waters, and your footsteps are not known.">Psalm 77:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thy way is in the sea, </span>&c. — Or rather, <span class="ital">was, </span>at that time; thou didst walk and lead thy people in untrodden paths; <span class="ital">and thy footsteps — </span>Or, <span class="ital">though thy footsteps were not seen — </span>God walked before his people through the sea, though he left no footsteps of himself behind him.

God's way is in the sanctuary. We are sure that God is holy in all his works. God's ways are like the deep waters, which cannot be fathomed; like the way of a ship, which cannot be tracked. God brought Israel out of Egypt. This was typical of the great redemption to be wrought out in the fulness of time, both by price and power. If we have harboured doubtful thoughts, we should, without delay, turn our minds to meditate on that God, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, that with him, he might freely give us all things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/77.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy way is in the sea - Probably the literal meaning here is, that God had shown his power and faithfulness in the sea (that is, the Red Sea), in delivering his people; it was there that his true character was seen, as possessing almighty power, and as being able to deliver his people. But this seems to have suggested, also, another idea - that the ways of God, in his providential dealings, were like walking through the sea, where no permanent track would be made, where the waves would close on the path, and where it would be impossible by any footprints to ascertain the way which he had taken. So in regard to his doings and his plans. There is nothing by which man can determine in regard to them. There are no traces by which he can follow out the divine designs - as none can follow one whose path is through the trackless waters. The subject is beyond man's reach, and there should be no rash or harsh judgment of the Almighty.<p>And thy path in the great waters - The additional idea here may be, that the ways or plans of God are vast - like the ocean. Even in shallow waters, when one wades through them, the path closes at once, and the way cannot be traced; but God's goings are like those of one who should move through the great ocean - over a boundless sea - where none could hope to follow him.<p>And thy footsteps are not known - The word rendered "footsteps" means properly the print made by the "heel," and the print made by the foot. The idea here is, that there are no traces in regard to many of the dealings of God, which appear most incomprehensible to us, and which trouble us most, as there can be no footprints left in the waters. We should not venture, therefore, to sit in judgment on the doings of God, or presume that we can understand them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/77.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. waters &#8230; , footsteps&#8212;may refer to His actual leading the people through the sea, though also expressing the mysteries of providence.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/77.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is in the sea; </span> or rather was at that time; thou didst walk and lead thy people in untrodden paths. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Are not known, </span> because the waters suddenly returned and covered them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/77.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thy way is in the sea,....

In the rendering of &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (with the tone regularly drawn back before the following monosyllable) even the Targum wavers between &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (my affliction) and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (my supplication); and just in the same way, in the rendering of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>, between &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; (have changed) and &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (years). &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; cannot possibly signify "change" in an active sense, as Luther renders: "The right hand of the Most High can change everything," but only a having become different (lxx and the Quinta &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), after which Maurer, Hupfeld, and Hitzig render thus: my affliction is this, that the right hand of the Most High has changed. But after we have read &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-6.htm">Psalm 77:6</a> as a poetical plural of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, a year, we have first of all to see whether it may not have the same signification here. And many possible interpretations present themselves. It can be interpreted: "my supplication is this: years of the right hand of the Most High" (viz., that years like to the former ones may be renewed); but this thought is not suited to the introduction with &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. We must either interpret it: my sickness, viz., from the side of God, i.e., the temptation which befalls me from Him, the affliction ordained by Him for me (Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), is this (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>); or, since in this case the unambiguous &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; would have been used instead of the Piel: my being pierced, my wounding, my sorrow is this (Symmachus &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, inf. Kal from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm">Psalm 109:22</a>, after the form &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; from &#1495;&#1504;&#1503;) - they are years of the right hand of the Most High, i.e., those which God's mighty hand, under which I have to humble myself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>), has formed and measured out to me. In connection with this way of taking <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> is now suitably and easily attached to what has gone before. The poet says to himself that the affliction allotted to him has its time, and will not last for ever. Therein lies a hope which makes the retrospective glance into the happier past a source of consolation to him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> the Chethb &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; is to be retained, for the &#1499;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> is thus best explained: "I bring to remembrance, i.e., make known with praise or celebrate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>), the deeds of Ja&#772;h, for I will remember Thy wondrous doing from days of old." His sorrow over the distance between the present and the past is now mitigated by the hope that God's right hand, which now casts down, will also again in His own time raise up. Therefore he will now, as the advance from the indicative to the cohortative (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>) imports, thoroughly console and refresh himself with God's work of salvation in all its miraculous manifestations from the earliest times. &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; is the most concise and comprehensive appellation for the God of the history of redemption, who, as Habakkuk prays, will revive His work of redemption in the midst of the years to come, and bring it to a glorious issue. To Him who then was and who will yet come the poet now brings praise and celebration. The way of God is His historical rule, and more especially, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, His redemptive rule. The primary passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>) shows that &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is not to be rendered "in the sanctuary" (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;), but "in holiness" (Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;). Holy and glorious in love and in anger. God goes through history, and shows Himself there as the incomparable One, with whose greatness no being, and least of all any one of the beingless gods, can be measured. He is &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, the God, God absolutely and exclusively, a miracle-working (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, not &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1488; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>)<p>(Note: The joining of the second word, accented on the first syllable and closely allied in sense, on to the first, which is accented on the ultima (the tone of which, under certain circumstances, retreats to the penult., &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;) or monosyllabic, by means of the hardening Dagesh (the so-called &#1491;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;), only takes place when that first word ends in  &#1492;- or  &#1492;-, not when it ends in  &#1492;-.))<p>God, and a God who by these very means reveals Himself as the living and supra-mundane God. He has made His omnipotence known among the peoples, viz., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> says, by the redemption of His people, the tribes of Jacob and the double tribe of Joseph, out of Egypt, - a deed of His arm, i.e., the work of His own might, by which He has proved Himself to all peoples and to the whole earth to be the Lord of the world and the God of salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;, brachio scil. extenso (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>, and frequently), just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, collo scil. erecto.
