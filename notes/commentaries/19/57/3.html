The most eminent believers need often repeat the publican's prayer, God be merciful to me a sinner. But if our souls trust in the Lord, this may assure us, in our utmost dangers, that our calamities will at length be overpast, and in the mean time, by faith and prayer, we must make him our refuge. Though God be most high, yet he condescends so low, as to take care that all things are made to work for good to his people. This is a good reason why we should pray earnestly. Look which way we will on this earth, refuge fails, no help appears; but we may look for it from heaven. If we have fled from the wrath to come, unto Jesus Christ, he that performed all things needful to purchase the salvation of his people, will do for us and in us all things needful for our enjoyment of it. It made David droop to think there should be those that bore him so much ill-will. But the mischief they designed against him, returned on themselves. And when David was in the greatest distress and disgrace, he did not pray, Lord, exalt me, but, Lord, exalt thine own name. Our best encouragement in prayer, is taken from the glory of God, and to that, more than to our own comfort, we should have regard in all our petitions for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall send from heaven - That is, from himself; or, he will interpose to save me. The psalmist does not say "how" he expected this interposition - whether by an angel, by a miracle, by tempest or storm, but he felt that help was to come from God alone, and he was sure that it would come.<p>And save me from the reproach ... - This would be more correctly rendered, "He shall save me; he shall reproach him that would swallow me up." So it is rendered in the margin. On the word rendered "would swallow me up," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>. The idea here is, that God would "rebuke" or "reproach," to wit, by overthrowing him that sought to devour or destroy him. God had interposed formerly in his behalf <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>, and he felt assured that he would do it again.<p>Selah - This seems here to be a mere musical pause. It has no connection with the sense. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-2.htm">Psalm 3:2</a>.<p>God shall send forth his mercy - In saving me.

The object is introduced when the verb is repeated according to the characteristic peculiarity of this Psalm. For the meaning cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-2.htm" title="Send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out of Zion;">Psalm 20:2</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-16.htm" title="He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.">Psalm 18:16</a>, though see note there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>from <span class="ital">the reproach</span> &c.] Better, (For) he that would swallow me up (or, <span class="ital">crush me</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm" title="Be merciful to me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresses me.">Psalm 56:1</a>, note) hath reproached. The object of the verb may be God, Whom the enemy blasphemes in denying His willingness to help His servant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/37-23.htm" title="Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel....">Isaiah 37:23-24</a>); or the Psalmist, whom he taunts with being deserted by his God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm" title="As with a sword in my bones, my enemies reproach me; while they say daily to me, Where is your God?">Psalm 42:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-12.htm" title="For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:">Psalm 55:12</a>). The rendering of A.V. marg., <span class="ital">he reproacheth him that would swallow me up</span>, is contrary to usage, for the word is never used of God rebuking men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Selah</span> here is probably misplaced, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm" title="God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that stays of old.

In the LXX it follows <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-2.htm" title="I will cry to God most high; to God that performes all things for me.">Psalm 57:2</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God shall send forth</span> &c.] God’s <span class="ital">lovingkindness and truth</span> (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm" title="Yet the LORD will command his loving kindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer to the God of my life.">Psalm 42:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm" title="O send out your light and your truth: let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill, and to your tabernacles.">Psalm 43:3</a>) are almost personified as “ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation.” It is in virtue of the lovingkindness which is the foundation of His covenant, and of the faithfulness which is an inalienable attribute of His nature, that God will send help to His servant.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up.</span> The two clauses stand unconnected in the original, which runs, "He shall send from heaven and save me - my pursuer reproaches - God shall send," etc. The second clause is really parenthetic, and, as Dr. Driver says ('Hebrew Verbs,' &sect; 163), "circumstantial," noting the circumstances under which God would take action. <span class="cmt_word">God shall send forth his mercy and his truth</span>. His mercy, to relieve the psalmist; his truth, to confound the psalmist's enemies. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/56.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>What the poet prays for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>, he now expresses as his confident expectation with which he solaces himself. &#1504;&#1491; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-9.htm">Psalm 56:9</a>) is not to be rendered "flight," which certainly is not a thing that can be numbered (Olshausen); but "a being fugitive," the unsettled life of a fugitive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8</a>), can really be numbered both by its duration and its many temporary stays here and there. And upon the fact that God, that He whose all-seeing eye follows him into every secret hiding-place of the desert and of the rocks, counteth (telleth) it, the poet lays great stress; for he has long ago learnt to despair of man. The accentuation gives special prominence to &#1504;&#1491;&#1497; as an emphatically placed object, by means of Zarka; and this is then followed by &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; with the conjunctive Galgal and the pausal &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; with Olewejored (the _ of which is placed over the final letter of the preceding word, as is always the case when the word marked with this double accent is monosyllabic, or dissyllabic and accented on the first syllable). He who counts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4</a>) all the steps of men, knows how long David has already been driven hither and thither without any settled home, although free from guilt. He comforts himself with this fact, but not without tears, which this wretched condition forces from him, and which he prays God to collect and preserve. Thus it is according to the accentuation, which takes &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; as imperative, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>; but since &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; ,&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, is also the form of the passive participle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-24.htm">1 Samuel 9:24</a>, and frequently, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-32.htm">2 Samuel 13:32</a>), it is more natural, in accordance with the surrounding thoughts, to render it so even in this instance (posita est lacrima mea), and consequently to pronounce it as Milra (Ewald, Hupfeld, Bttcher, and Hitzig). &#1491;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>) corresponds chiastically (crosswise) to &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;, with which &#1489;&#1504;&#1488;&#1491;&#1498; forms a play in sound; and the closing clause &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; unites with &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in the first member of the verse. Both <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-9.htm">Psalm 56:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-9.htm">Psalm 56:9</a> are wanting in any particle of comparison. The fact thus figuratively set forth, viz., that God collects the tears of His saints as it were in a bottle, and notes them together with the things which call them forth as in a memorial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>), the writer assumes; and only appropriatingly applies it to himself. The &#1488;&#1494; which follows may be taken either as a logical "in consequence of so and so" (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>), or as a "then" fixing a turning-point in the present tearful wandering life (viz., when there have been enough of the "wandering" and of the "tears"), or "at a future time" (more abruptly, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/36-13.htm">Psalm 36:13</a>, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is not an expansion of this &#1488;&#1494;, which would trail awkwardly after it. The poet says that one day his enemies will be obliged to retreat, inasmuch as a day will come when his prayer, which is even now heard, will be also outwardly fulfilled, and the full realization of the succour will coincide with the cry for help. By &#1494;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-10.htm">Psalm 56:10</a> he justifies this hope from his believing consciousness. It is not to be rendered, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a> : "I who know," which is a trailing apposition without any proper connection with what precedes; but, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a> : this I know (of this I am certain), that Elohim is for me. &#1494;&#1492; as a neuter, just as in connection with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, and also frequently elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-15.htm">Genesis 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-8.htm">Exodus 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-17.htm">Job 15:17</a>); and &#1500;&#1497; as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>. Through Elohim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a> continues, will I praise &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;: thus absolutely is the word named; it is therefore the divine word, just like &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>, the Son absolutely, therefore the divine Son. Because the thought is repeated, Elohim stands in the first case and then Jahve, in accordance with the Elohimic Psalm style, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-7.htm">Psalm 58:7</a>. The refrain in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm">Psalm 56:5</a>) indicates the conclusion of the strophe. The fact that we read &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in this instance, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a> &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm">Psalm 56:5</a>), is in accordance with the custom in the Psalms of not allowing the refrain to recur in exactly the same form. </body></html>
