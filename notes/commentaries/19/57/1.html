The most eminent believers need often repeat the publican's prayer, God be merciful to me a sinner. But if our souls trust in the Lord, this may assure us, in our utmost dangers, that our calamities will at length be overpast, and in the mean time, by faith and prayer, we must make him our refuge. Though God be most high, yet he condescends so low, as to take care that all things are made to work for good to his people. This is a good reason why we should pray earnestly. Look which way we will on this earth, refuge fails, no help appears; but we may look for it from heaven. If we have fled from the wrath to come, unto Jesus Christ, he that performed all things needful to purchase the salvation of his people, will do for us and in us all things needful for our enjoyment of it. It made David droop to think there should be those that bore him so much ill-will. But the mischief they designed against him, returned on themselves. And when David was in the greatest distress and disgrace, he did not pray, Lord, exalt me, but, Lord, exalt thine own name. Our best encouragement in prayer, is taken from the glory of God, and to that, more than to our own comfort, we should have regard in all our petitions for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/57.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be merciful unto me, O God - The same beginning as the former psalm - a cry for mercy; an overwhelming sense of trouble and danger leading him to come at once to the throne of God for help.

He believed that these calamities "would" pass away, or would cease; that a time would come when he would not thus be driven from place to place. At present he knew that he was in danger, and he desired the divine protection, for under "that" protection he would be safe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/57.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 57<p>Ps 57:1-11. Altaschith&#8212;or, "Destroy not." This is perhaps an enigmatical allusion to the critical circumstances connected with the history, for which compare 1Sa 22:1; 26:1-3. In Moses' prayer (De 9:26) it is a prominent petition deprecating God's anger against the people. This explanation suits the fifty-eighth and fifty-ninth also. Asaph uses it for the seventy-fifth, in the scope of which there is allusion to some emergency. Michtam&#8212;(See on [599]Ps 16:1, title). To an earnest cry for divine aid, the Psalmist adds, as often, the language of praise, in the assured hope of a favorable hearing.<p>1. my soul&#8212;or self, or life, which is threatened.<p>shadow of thy wings&#8212;(Ps 17:8; 36:7).<p>calamities&#8212;literally, "mischiefs" (Ps 52:2; 55:10).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/57.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.<p>2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.<p>3 He shall send groin heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up.

Selah.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1</a><p>"Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me." Urgent need suggests the repetition of the cry, for thus intense urgency of desire is expressed. If "he gives twice who gives quickly," so he who would receive quickly must ask twice. For mercy the Psalmist pleads at first, and he feels he cannot improve upon his plea, and therefore returns to it. God is the God of mercy, and the Father of mercies, it is most fit therefore that in distress we should seek mercy from him in whom it dwells. "For my soul trusteth in thee." Faith urges her suit right well. How can the Lord be unmerciful to a trustful soul? Our faith does not deserve mercy, but it always wins it from the sovereign grace of God when it is sincere, as in this case where the soul of the man believed. "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness." "Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge." Not in the cave alone would he hide, but in the cleft of the Rock of ages. As the little birds find ample shelter beneath the parental wing, even so would the fugitive place himself beneath the secure protection of the divine power. The emblem is delightfully familiar and suggestive. May we all experimentally know its meaning. When we cannot see the sunshine of God's face, it is blessed to cower down beneath the shadow of his wings. "Until these calamities be overpast." Evil will pass away, and the eternal wings will abide over us till then. Blessed be God, our calamities are matters of time, but our safety is a matter of eternity. When we are under the divine shadow, the passing over of trouble cannot harm us; the hawk flies across the sky, but this is no evil to the chicks when they are safely nestling beneath the hen.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a><p>"I will cry." He is quite safe, but yet he prays, for faith is never dumb. We pray because we believe. We exercise by faith the spirit of adoption whereby we cry. He says not, I do cry, or I have cried, but I will cry, and indeed, this resolution may stand with all of us until we pass through the gates of pearl; for while we are here below we shall still have need to cry. "Unto God most high" - Prayers are for God only; the greatness and sublimity of his person and character suggest and encourage prayer: however high our enemies, our heavenly Friend is higher, for he is "Most high," and he can readily send from the height of his power the succour which we need. "Unto God that performeth all things for me." He has cogent reason for praying, for he sees God performing The believer waits and God works. The Lord has undertaken for us, and he will not draw back, he will go through with his covenant engagements. Our translators have very properly inserted the words, "all things," for there is a blank in the Hebrew, as if it were a carte blanche, and you might write therein that the Lord would finish anything and everything which he has begun. Whatsoever the Lord takes in hand he will accomplish; hence past mercies are guarantees for the future, and admirable reasons for continuing to cry unto him.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a><p>"He shall send from heaven." If there be no fit instruments on earth, heaven shall yield up its legions of angels for the succour of the saints. We may in times of great straits expect mercies of a remarkable kind; like the Israelites in the wilderness, we shall have our bread hot from heaven, new every morning; and for the overthrow of our enemies God shall open his celestial batteries, and put them to utter confusion. Wherever the battle is more fierce than ordinary, there shall come succours from headquarters, for the Commander-in-chief sees all. "And save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up." He will be in time, not only to rescue his servants from being swallowed up, but even from being reproached. Not only shall they escape the flames, but not even the smell of fire shall pass upon them. O dog of hell, I am not only delivered from thy bite, but even from thy bark. Our foes shall not have the power to sneer at us, their cruel jests and taunting gibes shall be ended by the message from heaven, which shall for ever save us. "Selah." Such mercy may well make us pause to meditate and give thanks. Rest, singer, for God has given thee rest! "God shall send forth his mercy and his truth." He asked for mercy, and truth came with it. Thus evermore doth God give us more than we ask or think. His attributes, like angels on the wing, are ever ready to come to the rescue of his chosen.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a><p>"My soul is among lions." He was a very Daniel. Howled at, hunted, wounded, but not slain. His place was in itself one of extreme peril, and yet faith made him feel himself secure, so that he could lie down. The cave may have reminded him of a lion's den, and Saul and his band shouting and yelling in their disappointment at missing him, were the lions; yet beneath the divine shelter he felt himself safe. "And I lie even among them that are set on fire." Perhaps Saul and his band kindled a fire in the cavern while they halted in it, and David was thus reminded of the fiercer fire of their hate which burned within their hearts. Like the bush in Horeb, the believer is often in the midst of flames, but never consumed. It is a mighty triumph of faith when we can lie down even among firebrands and find rest, because God is our defence. "Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword." Malicious men carry a whole armoury in their mouths; they have not harmless mouths, whose teeth grind their own food as in a mill, but their jaws are as mischievous as if every tooth were a javelin or an arrow. They have no molars, all their teeth are canine, and their nature is canine, leonine, wolfish, devilish. As for that busy member the tongue, in the case of the malicious, it is a two-edged, keen, cutting, killing sword. The tongue, which is here compared to a sword, has the adjective sharp added to it, which is not used in reference to the teeth, which are compared to spears, as if to show that if men were actually to tear us with their teeth, like wild beasts, they could not thereby wound us so severely as they can do with their tongues. No weapon is so terrible as a tongue sharpened on the devil's grindstone; yet even this we need not fear, for "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that riseth against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn."<p>continued...<span class="bld">Al-taschith</span> signifies <span class="ital">destroy not</span>; which some think to be a preface containing the sum of the Psalm, and reminding David of his great distress, in which he then was; which obliged him to make fervent prayers to God that he would not destroy him, nor give him up into the hands of his enemies, who always designed and desired to destroy him, and now seemed to have a fair opportunity to do it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The cave; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Or "be gracious to me" (k); which words are repeated by him. "Be merciful", or "gracious, unto me"; to show the greatness of his distress, the eagerness, vehemency, and importunity he used in prayer; his case requiring a speedy answer, and immediate relief; and that he expected only from the mercy and grace of God; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a>; <p>for my soul trusteth in thee; or "in thy word"; as the Targum; and in thee only, both as the God of providence and the God of grace; and a great act of faith this was to trust in the Lord in such circumstances; and it was not a bare profession of trust, but it was hearty and sincere; his "soul" trusted in the Lord; he trusted in him with all his heart and soul, and trusted him with his soul or life: and this he makes a reason or argument for mercy; seeing, as the mercy of the Lord is an encouragement to faith and hope; so the Lord has declared, that he takes pleasure in those that hope and trust in it; wherefore mercy may be expected by such; <p>yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge; or "I will hope" (l); the meaning is, that he would betake himself to the power and protection of God, and make him his refuge from the enemy: the allusion is either to the hen, or any other bird covering its young with its wings, when a bird of prey is near, till that is gone; or to the cherubim, whose wings overshadowed the mercy seat, between which the glory of God dwelt; and so the Targum, <p>"in the shadow of thy Shechinah, or glorious Majesty, will I trust;'' <p>which agrees with his applying to the mercy seat, or to God on a throne of grace and mercy: and here he determines to abide, <p>until these calamities be overpast; the storm of them was over, which was very black and threatening. The Targum is, <p>"until the tumult is over;'' <p>and so the Syriac version; until Saul and his men were gone, of whom he was afraid.

And upon the fact that God, that He whose all-seeing eye follows him into every secret hiding-place of the desert and of the rocks, counteth (telleth) it, the poet lays great stress; for he has long ago learnt to despair of man. The accentuation gives special prominence to &#1504;&#1491;&#1497; as an emphatically placed object, by means of Zarka; and this is then followed by &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; with the conjunctive Galgal and the pausal &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; with Olewejored (the _ of which is placed over the final letter of the preceding word, as is always the case when the word marked with this double accent is monosyllabic, or dissyllabic and accented on the first syllable). He who counts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4</a>) all the steps of men, knows how long David has already been driven hither and thither without any settled home, although free from guilt. He comforts himself with this fact, but not without tears, which this wretched condition forces from him, and which he prays God to collect and preserve. Thus it is according to the accentuation, which takes &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; as imperative, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>; but since &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; ,&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, is also the form of the passive participle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-24.htm">1 Samuel 9:24</a>, and frequently, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-32.htm">2 Samuel 13:32</a>), it is more natural, in accordance with the surrounding thoughts, to render it so even in this instance (posita est lacrima mea), and consequently to pronounce it as Milra (Ewald, Hupfeld, Bttcher, and Hitzig). &#1491;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>) corresponds chiastically (crosswise) to &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;, with which &#1489;&#1504;&#1488;&#1491;&#1498; forms a play in sound; and the closing clause &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; unites with &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in the first member of the verse. Both <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-9.htm">Psalm 56:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-9.htm">Psalm 56:9</a> are wanting in any particle of comparison. The fact thus figuratively set forth, viz., that God collects the tears of His saints as it were in a bottle, and notes them together with the things which call them forth as in a memorial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>), the writer assumes; and only appropriatingly applies it to himself. The &#1488;&#1494; which follows may be taken either as a logical "in consequence of so and so" (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>), or as a "then" fixing a turning-point in the present tearful wandering life (viz., when there have been enough of the "wandering" and of the "tears"), or "at a future time" (more abruptly, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/36-13.htm">Psalm 36:13</a>, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm">Psalm 2:5</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is not an expansion of this &#1488;&#1494;, which would trail awkwardly after it. The poet says that one day his enemies will be obliged to retreat, inasmuch as a day will come when his prayer, which is even now heard, will be also outwardly fulfilled, and the full realization of the succour will coincide with the cry for help. By &#1494;&#1492;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-10.htm">Psalm 56:10</a> he justifies this hope from his believing consciousness. It is not to be rendered, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a> : "I who know," which is a trailing apposition without any proper connection with what precedes; but, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a> : this I know (of this I am certain), that Elohim is for me. &#1494;&#1492; as a neuter, just as in connection with &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, and also frequently elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-15.htm">Genesis 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-8.htm">Exodus 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-17.htm">Job 15:17</a>); and &#1500;&#1497; as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>. Through Elohim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a> continues, will I praise &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;: thus absolutely is the word named; it is therefore the divine word, just like &#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>, the Son absolutely, therefore the divine Son. Because the thought is repeated, Elohim stands in the first case and then Jahve, in accordance with the Elohimic Psalm style, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-7.htm">Psalm 58:7</a>. The refrain in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm">Psalm 56:5</a>) indicates the conclusion of the strophe. The fact that we read &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in this instance, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a> &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm">Psalm 56:5</a>), is in accordance with the custom in the Psalms of not allowing the refrain to recur in exactly the same form. </body></html>
