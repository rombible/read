How much more is “the truth of God, in accomplishing his promises, by the redemption of our souls, and the confusion of our spiritual enemies, a subject which demands a never ceasing tribute of gratitude and love, of praise and thanksgiving. To celebrate it aright, with the melody of voices and affections, all in perfect concord, is the duty and delight of the church militant; which, when thus employed, affords the best resemblance of the church triumphant.” — Horne. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/71.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>71:14-24 The psalmist declares that the righteousness of Christ, and the great salvation obtained thereby, shall be the chosen subject of his discourse. Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will also praise thee with the psaltery - Margin, as in Hebrew, "with the instrument of psaltery."

Love so amazing calls for sweetest praise. David would give his best music, both vocal and instrumental, to the Best of Masters. His harp should not be silent, nor his voice. "Even thy truth, O my God." This is ever a most enchanting attribute - viz., the truth or faithfulness of our covenant God. On this we rest, and from it we draw streams of richest consolation. His promises are sure, his love unalterable, his veracity indisputable. What saint Will not praise him as he remembers this? "Unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel." Here is a new name, and, as it were, a new song. The Holy One of Israel is at once a lofty and an endearing name, full of teaching. Let us resolve, by all means within our power, to honour him.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-23.htm">Psalm 71:23</a><p>"My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee." It shall be no weariness to me to praise thee. It shall be a delightful recreation, a solace, a joy. The essence of song lies in the holy joy of the singer. "And my soul, which thou hast redeemed." Soul-singing is the soul of singing, Till men are redeemed, they are like instruments out of tune; but when once the precious blood has set them at liberty, then are they fitted to magnify the Lord who bought them. Our being bought with a price is a more than sufficient reason for our dedicating ourselves to the earnest worship of God our Saviour.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-24.htm">Psalm 71:24</a><p>"My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long." I will talk to myself, and to thee, my God, and to my fellow men: my theme shall be thy way of justifying sinners, the glorious display of thy righteousness and grace in thy dear Son; and this most fresh and never-to-be-exhausted subject shall be ever with me, from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same. Others talk of their beloveds, and they shall be made to hear of mine. I will become an incessant talker, while this matter lies on my heart, for in all company this subject will be in season. "For they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt." As in many other Psalms, the concluding stanzas speak of that as an accomplished fact, which was only requested in former verses. Faith believes that she has her request, and she has it. She is the substance of things hoped for - a substance so real and tangible, that it sets the glad soul a-singing.

The conjunction of the psaltery and harp seems to imply that the "praise," of which the writer here speaks, is to be public praise in the sanctuary, accompanied by the usual sacred music. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/71.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-15.htm">Psalm 40:15</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/70-3.htm">Psalm 70:3</a>), <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-26.htm">Psalm 35:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-29.htm">Psalm 109:29</a>, and other passages, the reading of &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, with the Syriac, instead of &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-13.htm">Psalm 71:13</a> commends itself; but there are also other instances in this Psalm of a modification of the original passages, and the course of the thoughts is now climactic: confusion, ruin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-11.htm">Psalm 6:11</a>), and in fact ruin accompanied by reproach and shame. This is the fate that the poet desires for his deadly foes. In prospect of this he patiently composes himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-14.htm">Psalm 71:14</a> (cf. 31:25); and when righteous retribution appears, he will find new matter and ground and motive for the praise of God in addition to all such occasion as he has hitherto had. The late origin of the Psalm betrays itself again here; for instead of the praet. Hiph. &#1492;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; (which is found only in the Books of Kings and in Ecclesiastes), the older language made use of the praet. Ka.

He will tell those things which cannot be so reckoned up; he will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord Jahve, and with praise acknowledge His righteousness, Him alone. Since &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, like the New Testament &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, usually signifies the proofs of the divine &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), the Beth is the Beth of accompaniment, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;, vernire cum, is like Arab. j'a&#770;' b (ata&#770;), equivalent to afferre, he will bring the proofs of the divine power, this rich material, with him.

From youth up God has instructed him, viz., in His ways (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a>), which are worthy of all praise, and hitherto (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, found only in this passage in the Psalter, and elsewhere almost entirely confined to prose) has he, "the taught of Jahve" (&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; &#1492;), had to praise the wonders of His rule and of His leadings.

May God, then, in this stage of life also to which he has attained, preserve him in life and in His favour, until (&#1506;&#1491;  equals  &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-5.htm">Psalm 132:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>, and frequently) he shall have declared His arm, i.e., His mighty interposition in human history, to posterity (&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;), and to all who shall come (supply &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;), i.e., the whole of the future generation, His strength, i.e., the impossibility of thwarting His purposes.
