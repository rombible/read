Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of the year, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, but on every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness ... - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-8.htm">Psalm 71:8</a>.

There is a play in the Heb. on the words <span class="ital">tell</span> and <span class="ital">tale</span>.

Salvation is inseparable from righteousness. It is as being righteous himself that God accepts the righteous, and as faithful to his promises, which is a part of his righteousness, that he pardons penitents. <span class="cmt_word">For I know not the numbers thereof</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>). God's acts of pardoning mercy, by which he brings about the salvation of penitents, are innumerable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/71.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Brought safely through dangers of every kind, he is become &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514;, as a wonder, a miracle (Arabic aft from afata, cognate afaka, &#1492;&#1508;&#1498;, to bend, distort: a turning round, that which is turned round or wrenched, i.e., that which is contrary to what is usual and looked for) to many, who gaze upon him as such with astonishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">Psalm 40:4</a>). It is his God, however, to whom, as hitherto so also in time to come, he will look to be thus wonderfully preserved: &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-33.htm">2 Samuel 22:33</a>. &#1506;&#1494; is a genitive, and the suffix is thrown back (vid., supra, p 171) in order that what God is to, and does for, the poet may be brought forward more clearly and independently [lit. unalloyed]. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-8.htm">Psalm 71:8</a> tells us what it is that he firmly expects on the ground of what he possesses in God. And on this very ground arises the prayer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a> also: Cast me not away (viz., from Thy presence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-13.htm">Psalm 51:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>, and frequently) in the time (&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-11.htm">Genesis 8:11</a>) of old age - he is therefore already an old man (&#1494;&#1511;&#1503;), though only just at the beginning of the &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;. He supplicates favour for the present and for the time still to come: now that my vital powers are failing, forsake me not! Thus he prays because he, who has been often wondrously delivered, is even now threatened by foes. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-11.htm">Psalm 71:11</a>, introduced by means of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, tells us what their thoughts of him are, and what they purpose doing. &#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, does not belong to &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, as it dies not in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a> also, and elsewhere. The &#1500; is that of relation or of reference, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-6.htm">Psalm 41:6</a>. The unnecessary &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; betrays a poet of the later period; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-82.htm">Psalm 119:82</a> (where it was less superfluous), and on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5</a>. The later poet also reveals himself in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-12.htm">Psalm 71:12</a>, which is an echo of very similar prayers of David in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-14.htm">Psalm 40:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/70-2.htm">Psalm 70:2</a>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-22.htm">Psalm 35:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-22.htm">Psalm 38:22</a>. The Davidic style is to be discerned here throughout in other points also. In place of &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; the Ker substitutes &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, which is the form exclusively found elsewhere. </body></html>
