With this petition every true believer may come boldly to the throne of grace. The gracious care of Divine providence in our birth and infancy, should engage us to early piety. He that was our Help from our birth, ought to be our Hope from our youth. Let none expect ease or comfort from the world. Those who love the Lord, often are hated and persecuted; men wondered at for their principles and conduct; but the Lord has been their strong refuge. The faithful servants of God may be assured that he will not cast them off in old age, nor forsake them when their strength fails.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/71.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Saying, God hath forsaken him - That is, God has given him over; he no longer protects him; he regards him as a wicked man, and we shall therefore, not only be "safe" in our attempts upon his life, but we shall be "justified" in those attempts.<p>Persecute and take him - It can be done safely now; it can be done with propriety.<p>For there is none to deliver him - He has no one now to whom to look; no one on whom he can rely.

Good men may seem to others to be forsaken of God; and they themselves may sometimes think they are; and they may be forsaken for a small moment, when God withdraws his gracious presence, or does not afford immediate help; but never finally and totally. This David's enemies concluded, from the distressed condition he was in, being obliged to leave his family and court, and flee from his son, and wander up and down with a small retinue; and this they said to one another, to encourage themselves to lay violent hands upon him, which they thought they might do with ease and impunity; wherefore it follows, <p>persecute and take him; pursue after him eagerly and diligently; lose no time; and, when come up to him, seize upon him, without any fear of God or man; <p>for there is none to deliver him; out of our hands. God will not, for he has forsaken him; and men cannot, for he has not an army sufficient to defend him or recover him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/71.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Saying, <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for <i>there is</i> none to deliver <i>him</i>.</span><p>(h) Thus the wicked both blaspheme God and triumph against his saints, as though he had forsaken them if he permits them to fall into their hands.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/71.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">God hath forsaken him</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm" title="My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?">Psalm 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-21.htm" title="Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.">Psalm 38:21</a> <span class="ital">b</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">persecute</span>] R.V. pursue.

The first of these two strophes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-1.htm">Psalm 71:1-3</a>) is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2-4</a>, the second (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-4.htm">Psalm 71:4-6</a>, with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-4.htm">Psalm 71:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>) from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10-11</a>; both, however, in comparison with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/70-1.htm">Psalm 70:1-5</a> exhibit the far more encroaching variations of a poet who reproduces the language of others with a freer hand. Olshausen wishes to read &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-3.htm">Psalm 71:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-9.htm">Psalm 91:9</a>, instead of &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;, which he holds to be an error in writing. But this old Mosaic, Deuteronomial word (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>) - cf. the post-biblical oath &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; (by the Temple!) - is unassailable. Jahve, who is called a rock of refuge in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>, is here called a rock of habitation, i.e., a high rock that cannot be stormed or scaled, which affords a safe abode; and this figure is pursued still further with a bold remodelling of the text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a> : &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, constantly to go into, i.e., which I can constantly, and therefore always, as often as it is needful, betake myself for refuge. The additional &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is certainly not equivalent to &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;; it would more likely be equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1510;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;; but probably it is an independent clause: Thou hast (in fact) commanded, i.e., unalterably determined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>), to show me salvation, for my rock, etc. To the words &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1510;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; corresponds the expression &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>, which the lxx renders &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, whereas instead of the former three words it has &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, and seems to have read &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-15.htm">Daniel 11:15</a> (Hitzig).

And &#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497; instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10</a>, is just such another felicitous modification. It is impracticable to define the meaning of this &#1490;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497; according to &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492;, Arab. jz', retribuere (prop. to cut up, distribute), because &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; is the representative of this Aramaeo-Arabic verb in the Hebrew. Still less, however, can it be derived from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, transire, the participle of which, if it would admit of a transitive meaning  equals  &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; (Targum), ought to be &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497;. The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492;, in accordance with its radical signification of abscindere (root &#1490;&#1494;, synon. &#1511;&#1509;, &#1511;&#1491;, &#1511;&#1496;, and the like), denotes in this instance the separating of the child from the womb of the mother, the retrospect going back from youth to childhood, and even to his birth. The lxx &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2; (&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) is an erroneous reading for &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, as is clear from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10</a>, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a> (cf. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a>), is at the bottom of the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>.
