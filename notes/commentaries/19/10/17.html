God prepares the heart for prayer, by kindling holy desires, and strengthening our most holy faith, fixing the thoughts, and raising the affections, and then he graciously accepts the prayer. The preparation of the heart is from the Lord, and we must seek unto him for it. Let the poor, afflicted, persecuted, or tempted believer recollect, that Satan is the prince of this world, and that he is the father of all the ungodly. The children of God cannot expect kindness, truth, or justice from such persons as crucified the Lord of glory. But this once suffering Jesus, now reigns as King over all the earth, and of his dominion there shall be no end. Let us commit ourselves unto him, humbly trusting in his mercy. He will rescue the believer from every temptation, and break the arm of every wicked oppressor, and bruise Satan under our feet shortly. But in heaven alone will all sin and temptation be shut out, though in this life the believer has a foretaste of deliverance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble - Their desire or their prayer that thou wouldst interpose in their behalf in the time of danger, and rescue them. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8-9</a>. The word "humble" here refers to those who were poor, downtrodden, oppressed; and the original reference is, doubtless, to the psalmist himself, and to his friends. He was so certain that God would interpose, he had such assurance that his prayer would he answered, that his mind was perfectly calm.<p>Thou will prepare their heart - Margin, "or, establish." The margin seems most accurately to express the meaning of the original word - &#1514;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;  ta&#772;kiyn. The idea is, that he would settle or confirm their heart; that is, that he would dispel their fears and allay their apprehensions by the assurances of his favor, and by his gracious interposition. They had been full of apprehension and alarm, but the assurances of the divine favor would establish their hearts and give them peace.<p>Thou wilt cause thine ear to hear - Another form of expressing assurance of the same thing. The idea is, that he would incline his ear, or make it attentive to the cry of his afflicted people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-18.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>; for the coming of Christ's kingdom, and that the kingdoms of this world may become his; for the destruction of antichrist, and for the avenging the blood of the saints. The prayers of God's people sometimes lie in inward and secret desires of the soul, and are not expressed in words; and these desires are all before the Lord, and are well known unto him; yea, such prayers of the heart, and which come from it, are principally regarded by him; they being his own preparation, as is suggested in the next clause, and the breathings of his Spirit; and especially the desires of humble souls are regarded, whose prayers he never despises, nor sends them away empty, but fills with his good things; <p>thou wilt prepare their heart; for prayer, by pouring a spirit of grace and supplication on them, impressing their minds with a sense of things to be prayed for, and drawing out the desires of their souls unto them, and making intercession for them with groanings according to the will of God, and so helping their infirmities; and it is God's work to prepare the heart for prayer, as well as to put words into the mouth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-1.htm">Proverbs 16:1</a>; or "thou wilt direct their heart" (n); to the object of prayer, himself, and to the things to be prayed for, for they know not what to pray for, nor how as they should; and to what may encourage to it, as the love of God, the covenant of grace, the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ: or "confirm" or "establish their heart" (o); strengthen and fix them, that they be not wavering and doubtful, but certain and assured of success, believing that their desires will be fulfilled in God's own time; <p>thou wilt cause thine ear to hear; God has an ear to hear the prayers of his people, nor is his ear heavy that it cannot hear; his ears are open to the cries of righteous ones; nor will he ever turn a deaf ear to them, but will give an answer in his own time and way; which is an instance of his sovereign grace and goodness. These words express the faith of the psalmist in God being a God hearing and answering prayer, particularly in things relating to the ruin of antichrist and his followers, and to the kingdom and glory of his son Jesus Christ. <p>(n)  "dirigis", Vatablus; "diriges", Tigurine version.

Instead of the Chethb &#1493;&#1491;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1493;&#1491;&#1499;&#1492; perf. consec.), the Ker&#1502; reads &#1497;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; more in accordance with the Hebrew use of the tenses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-40.htm">Job 38:40</a> is the rule for the interpretation. The two futures depict the settled and familiar lying in wait of the plunderer. True, the Kal &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; in the signification "to crouch down" finds no support elsewhere; but the Arab. dakka to make even (cf. Arab. rs&#803;d, firmiter inhaesit loco, of the crouching down of beasts of prey, of hunters, and of foes) and the Arab. dagga, compared by Hitzig, to move stealthily along, to creep, and dugjeh a hunter's hiding-place exhibit synonymous significations. The &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; of the lxx is not far out of the way. And one can still discern in it the assumption that the text is to be read &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; &#1493;&#1491;&#1499;&#1492;: and crushed he sinks (Aquila: &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;); but even &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; is not found elsewhere, and if the poet meant that, why could he not have written &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;? (cf. moreover <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a>). If &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; is taken in the sense of a position in which one is the least likely to be seen, then the first two verbs refer to the sculker, but the third according to the usual schema (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-5.htm">Psalm 124:5</a>) is the predicate to &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;) going before it. Crouching down as low as possible he lies on the watch, and the feeble and defenceless fall into his strong ones, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, i.e., claws. Thus the ungodly slays the righteous, thinking within himself: God has forgotten, He has hidden His face, i.e., He does not concern Himself about these poor creatures and does not wish to know anything about them (the denial of the truth expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>); He has in fact never been one who sees, and never will be. These two thoughts are blended; &#1506;&#1489; with the perf. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-3.htm">Job 21:3</a>, and the addition of &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>) denies the possibility of God seeing now any more than formerly, as being an absolute absurdity. The thought of a personal God would disturb the ungodly in his doings, he therefore prefers to deny His existence, and thinks: there is only fate and fate is blind, only an absolute and it has no eyes, only a notion and that cannot interfere in the affairs of men. </body></html>
