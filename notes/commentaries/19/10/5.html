We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His ways are always grievous - His paths; his manner of life; his conduct toward God; his dealings with men. The word rendered "are grievious," &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  ya&#772;chiylu&#770; - has been variously rendered. The Latin Vulgate renders it, "His ways are defiled." So the Septuagint. Coverdale renders it, "His ways are always filthy." Prof. Alexander, "His ways are firm." So DeWette, "Es gelingen seine Wege." Horsley, "His ways are confident." This variety in the interpretation arises from the ambiguity of the original word - &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;  chu&#770;l. The meaning of this word, as given by Genesius, is to turn round, to twist, to whirl; and hence:<p>(1) to dance;<p>(2) to be whirled, or twisted upon anything;<p>(3) to twist oneself with pain, or to be in pain;<p>(4) to bear or bring forth;<p>(5) to tremble, to quake;<p>(6) to be strong or stable, as things twisted are.<p>Hence, he translates this passage, "his ways are firm, or stable, that is, all his affairs prosper." But it seems to me plain that this is not the idea in the mind of the psalmist. He is not dwelling on the prosperity of the wicked, or on the result of his conduct, but on his character. In the previous verses he had stated some of the traits in his character, and the subsequent verses continue the description; hence, it is natural that we should expect to find some special feature of his character referred to here, and not that there should be an allusion to the stability of his affairs. It seems to me, therefore, that the exact idea here is, that his ways, or his modes of feelling and conduct were always perverse and forced, and hard; that there was always something tortuous and unnatural about him; that he was not straightforward and honest; that he did not see things as they are, and did not act in a plain and upright manner.<p>Thy judgments - Thy laws; or, the principles of thy govermnent.<p>Are far above out of his sight - They are out of the range of his vision. He does not see them. His thoughts grovel on the earth, and he is never elevated in his views so as to see the great principles of truth.<p>As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them - He treats them with contempt and scorn, as if he had no fear of them, or as if he were entirely confident of his own ability to overcome them. This is an illustration of his pride and self-confidence, for it is the characteristic of the proud and self-confident to boast in this manner. The word rendered "puffeth" means to breathe, to blow; and the idea here is, that he acted as though he could sweep them away with a breath. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5, 6.

And the accomplishment or disappointment of designs is frequently expressed by this metaphor; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-23.htm" title="By your messengers you have reproached the LORD, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.">2 Kings 19:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-14.htm" title="Behold, he travails with iniquity, and has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.">Psalm 7:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm" title="None calls for justice, nor any pleads for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.">Isaiah 59:4</a></span>, &c.

He doth not discern, nor regard, nor fear them, nor think of them, but goes on securely and resolvedly in his wicked courses. He hath not so much faith nor reason as to apprehend or consider them, but, like a brute beast, looks only downward to the earth, and minds not things above him. And thus it seems best to agree with the foregoing and following clauses. His devices succeed, and therefore he neither fears God’s judgments, nor the power of his enemies, but fancies his happiness to be unchangeable, as it follows, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-6.htm" title="He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.">Psalm 10:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He puffeth at them, </span> i.e. he despiseth them, being confident that he can blow them away with a breath.

From &#1497; the poet takes a leap to &#1511; which, however, seems to be a substitute for the &#1499; which one would expect to find, since the following Psalm begins with &#1500;. David's &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a>) is taken from the lips of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>. "Jahve arises, comes, appears" are kindred expressions in the Old Testament, all of which point to a final personal appearing of God to take part in human history from which He has now, as it were, retired into a state of repose becoming invisible to human eyes. Hupfeld and others wrongly translate "let not man become strong." The verb &#1506;&#1494;&#1494; does not only mean to be or become strong, but also to feel strong, powerful, possessed of power, and to act accordingly, therefore: to defy, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm">Psalm 52:9</a>, like &#1506;&#1494; defiant, impudent (post-biblical &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; shamelessness). &#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-10.htm">2 Chronicles 14:10</a>, is man, impotent in comparison with God, and frail in himself. The enemies of the church of God are not unfrequently designated by this name, which indicates the impotence of their pretended power (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>). David prays that God may repress the arrogance of these defiant ones, by arising and manifesting Himself in all the greatness of His omnipotence, after His forbearance with them so long has seemed to them to be the result of impotence. He is to arise as the Judge of the world, judging the heathen, while they are compelled to appear before Him, and, as it were, defile before Him (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;), He is to lay &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; on them. If "razor" be the meaning it is equivocally expressed; and if, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>, we associate with it the idea of an ignominious rasure, or of throat-cutting, it is a figure unworthy of the passage. The signification master (lxx, Syr., Vulg., and Luther) rests upon the reading &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, which we do not with Thenius and others prefer to the traditional reading (even Jerome translates: pone, Domine, terrorem eis); for &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; rof , which according to the Masora is instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; (like &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a> for &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1488;), is perfectly appropriate. Hitzig objects that fear is not a thing which one lays upon any one; but &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; means not merely fear, but an object, or as Hitzig himself explains it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm">Malachi 2:5</a> a "lever," of fear. It is not meant that God is to cause them to be overcome with terror (&#1506;&#1500;), nor that He is to put terror into them (&#1489;&#1468;), but that He is to make them (&#1500;( m in no way differing from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-6.htm">Psalm 140:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-13.htm">Job 14:13</a>) an object of terror, from which to their dismay, as the wish is further expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-20.htm">Psalm 9:20</a>, they shall come to know (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>) that they are mortal men.
