God prepares the heart for prayer, by kindling holy desires, and strengthening our most holy faith, fixing the thoughts, and raising the affections, and then he graciously accepts the prayer. The preparation of the heart is from the Lord, and we must seek unto him for it. Let the poor, afflicted, persecuted, or tempted believer recollect, that Satan is the prince of this world, and that he is the father of all the ungodly. The children of God cannot expect kindness, truth, or justice from such persons as crucified the Lord of glory. But this once suffering Jesus, now reigns as King over all the earth, and of his dominion there shall be no end. Let us commit ourselves unto him, humbly trusting in his mercy. He will rescue the believer from every temptation, and break the arm of every wicked oppressor, and bruise Satan under our feet shortly.

This is one of the instances which frequently occur in the Psalms, where, though there is a desponding spirit, or an apprehension of danger expressed in the beginning of the poem, it ends with the language of exultation and triumph. The psalmist speaks here as if what he had desired was actually accomplished, and as if the enemies that had encompassed him, and all the enemies of the Lord, were actually overthrown, and God now reigned supreme. He was so confident that this would be so, that he speaks of it as if it were already done. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>; see also <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">Psalm 6:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-18.htm">Psalm 9:18</a>.<p>The heathen are perished out of his land - That is, this would so certainly occur that he might speak of it as if it were actually done.

Let us learn that we are sure to speed well, if we carry our complaint to the King of kings. Rights will be vindicated, and wrongs redressed, at his throne. His government neglects not the interests of the needy, nor does it tolerate oppression in the mighty. Great God, we leave ourselves in thine hand; to thee we commit thy church afresh.

Christ was King from everlasting, and during the Old Testament dispensation he was promised and prophesied of as King; and he had a kingdom when he was here on earth, though not of this world; nor was it with observation. At his ascension to heaven, and session at the right hand of God, he sat down upon the same throne with his Father, and was made or declared Lord and Christ, and appeared more visibly in his kingly office; and in the latter day it will be yet more manifest that he is King of saints, and when indeed he will be King over all the earth, and his kingdom will be an everlasting one: he will have no successor in it, nor will any usurper obtain any more; the devil, beast, and false prophet, will be cast into the lake of fire; all antichristian states will be destroyed, and all authority, rule, and power, put down; nor can his kingdom ever be subverted, he must reign till all enemies are put under his feet; he will reign to the end of the present world, and with the saints a thousand years in the new heaven and earth, and in the ultimate glory to all eternity; nor will his government cease when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to the Father, only the mode of the administration of it. Here begins the song of praise; the reign of Christ is matter of joy; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-1.htm">Psalm 97:1</a>; <p>the Heathen are perished out of his land: not the seven nations which were driven out of the land of Canaan, to make way for the people of Israel, that was long ago; nor the wicked and degenerate Jews, called the Heathen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>; compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>; on whom, and on whose temple, city, and nation, Christ's native land, wrath is come to the uttermost; and they are perished out of it: nor hypocrites out of churches, which are Christ's property; but the antichristian party out of the world, which is Christ's land by creation, as God, and by the gift of his father to him, as Mediator. The followers of antichrist are called Gentiles, and the nations of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>; and these will be no more; they will be utterly destroyed, when the man of sin shall be consumed with the breath of Christ's mouth and the brightness of his coming. The seventh vial will clear the world of all the remains of Christ's enemies: this also is cause of rejoicing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD <i>is</i> King for ever and ever: the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> heathen are perished out of his land.</span><p>(k) The hypocrites or such as live not after God's law, will be destroyed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. The second clause has been variously explained to refer (1) to the past, or (2) to the future (prophetic perfect). If (1) it refers to the past, the Psalmist finds the guarantee for the fulfilment of his prayers and hopes in the extermination of the Canaanites, or, it may be, in the repulse of ‘the nations’ referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/9-5.htm" title="You have rebuked the heathen, you have destroyed the wicked, you have put out their name for ever and ever....">Psalm 9:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm" title="The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.">Psalm 9:15</a> ff. As the nations have been driven out before God’s people, so the wicked must ultimately give place to the godly, and Jehovah’s land will become in fact what it is in name, the Holy Land. Cp. the frequent warnings to Israel that the fate of the Canaanites might be theirs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/8-19.htm" title="And it shall be, if you do at all forget the LORD your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish....">Deuteronomy 8:19-20</a>, &c.). If (2) the clause refers to the future, it is a confident anticipation (expressed as though it were already realised) of the ultimate destruction of the foreign oppressors of Israel, including, it may be supposed, all the godless of whom they are typical.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first explanation suits the context best. The complaint and prayer of the psalm are directed against wicked oppressors within the nation of Israel, not against foreign enemies. An anticipation of the destruction of such external enemies is foreign to the line of thought. But an appeal to history as the ground of hope for the future is quite in place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his land</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm" title="In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.">Leviticus 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-18.htm" title="Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.">Joel 2:18</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - Here begins the third part of the psalm. It is, as has been observed, "confident and triumphant." The psalmist has, in the first part, shown the wickedness of the ungodly; in the second, he has prayed for vengeance on them, and for the deliverance of their victims; in the third, he expresses his certainty that his prayer is heard, and that the punishment and deliverance for which he has prayed are as good as accomplished. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is King for ever and ever</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-10.htm">Psalm 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-10.htm">Psalm 146:10</a>). Thus God's kingdom is established, his authority vindicated, his absolute rule over all men made manifest. Internal and external foes are alike overcome. The heathen - whether uncircumcised in the flesh or in the heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25, 26</a>) - are perished out of his (Jehovah's) land. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The comparison to the lion is still in force here and the description recurs to its commencement in the second strophe, by tracing back the persecution of the ungodly to its final cause. Instead of the Chethb &#1493;&#1491;&#1499;&#1492; (&#1493;&#1491;&#1499;&#1492; perf. consec.), the Ker&#1502; reads &#1497;&#1491;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; more in accordance with the Hebrew use of the tenses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-40.htm">Job 38:40</a> is the rule for the interpretation. The two futures depict the settled and familiar lying in wait of the plunderer. True, the Kal &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; in the signification "to crouch down" finds no support elsewhere; but the Arab. dakka to make even (cf. Arab. rs&#803;d, firmiter inhaesit loco, of the crouching down of beasts of prey, of hunters, and of foes) and the Arab. dagga, compared by Hitzig, to move stealthily along, to creep, and dugjeh a hunter's hiding-place exhibit synonymous significations. The &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; of the lxx is not far out of the way. And one can still discern in it the assumption that the text is to be read &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; &#1493;&#1491;&#1499;&#1492;: and crushed he sinks (Aquila: &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;); but even &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; is not found elsewhere, and if the poet meant that, why could he not have written &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;? (cf. moreover <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a>). If &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; is taken in the sense of a position in which one is the least likely to be seen, then the first two verbs refer to the sculker, but the third according to the usual schema (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-5.htm">Psalm 124:5</a>) is the predicate to &#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1495;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;) going before it. Crouching down as low as possible he lies on the watch, and the feeble and defenceless fall into his strong ones, &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, i.e., claws. Thus the ungodly slays the righteous, thinking within himself: God has forgotten, He has hidden His face, i.e., He does not concern Himself about these poor creatures and does not wish to know anything about them (the denial of the truth expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>); He has in fact never been one who sees, and never will be. These two thoughts are blended; &#1506;&#1489; with the perf. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/21-3.htm">Job 21:3</a>, and the addition of &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>) denies the possibility of God seeing now any more than formerly, as being an absolute absurdity. The thought of a personal God would disturb the ungodly in his doings, he therefore prefers to deny His existence, and thinks: there is only fate and fate is blind, only an absolute and it has no eyes, only a notion and that cannot interfere in the affairs of men. </body></html>
