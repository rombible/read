We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire - Margin, as in Hebrew, soul's. The main idea in this verse seems to be that he is a boaster - a man who makes some proclamation about himself as being superior to others, and who, in that proportion, looks with disdain or contempt on others. He vaunts himself, or makes an ostentatious display of something on which he prides himself, as wealth, strength, beauty, talent, prowess, etc. The particular thing here, it would seem, of which he boasted was his natural inclinations; the propensities and passions of his soul; that is, he took pride in himself, in his own passions, desires, lusts, tastes, and made a boastful display of them, as if he regarded them as something honorable, or as something fitted to excite admiration in others. This is not a very uncommon characteristic of wicked men; at least it is found in a certain class of wicked men. They pride themselves in whatever they have in their character that is special, or that is their own, for the very reason that it is theirs; and they become so shameless that they do not hesitate publicly to boast of that which should be regarded as a disgrace. A certain class of younq men are very apt to "boast" of passions and practices which should cover their faces with the burning blush of shame.<p>And blesseth the covetous - Margin, "the covetous blesseth himself, he abhorreth the Lord." Prof. Alexander renders this, "And winning (that is, when he wins) blesses, despises Jehovah." In other words, he hypocritically thanks God for his success, but despises him in his heart. This probably expresses the correct idea. The word rendered "the covetous" - &#1489;&#1510;&#1506;  botse&#772;&#8219; - is a participle, from the verb - &#1489;&#1510;&#1506;  ba&#770;tsa&#8219;, to cut in pieces; then, to plunder, to spoil; and then, to be greedy after gain. Here, the natural construction would seem to be to refer it not to another, as one who was covetous, but to himself, as greedy, or as succeeding in the object of his desire; as referring to the fact that he obtained his heart's desire, and as showing what his feelings were then. He was filled with evil desires, and was so shameless of them that he openly avowed them; and when he obtained the object of his wishes, he did what is here denoted by the word bless - as will be explained directly.<p>The idea in the mind of the writer seems to be that he cherished the desire, and made no secret of it, and obtained the object of his wishes. The natural explanation of the manner in which he did this is, that it was by plunder, rapine, or spoil, for this would be most literally expressed by the word used. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>. It might be, however, by unjust gains, or dishonest dealing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>. The word bless here may mean, as in the margin, blesses himself; or, as Prof. Alexander supposes, may mean that he blesses the Lord, that is, renders hypocritical thanks for his success, and professes to acknowledge that all is the gift of God, while at the same time he expresses contempt for him, and despises him in his heart. If the usual meaning of the word bless is to be retained, however, it would seem to be most in accordance with the spirit of the passage that he should bless himself, that is, his own talents, skill, power; in other words, that he should attribute all his success to himself.<p>The idea does not seem to be that he was even professedly a religious man, but that he was a proud and vain boaster who attributed all success to himself, and despised God and his claims. It has been supposed by some, however, and with plausibility (DeWette, and others), that the word rendered "bless" here - &#1489;&#1512;&#1498;  be&#772;re&#772;k - as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>, means, not to bless, but to curse. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>. DeWette renders it, Der Rauber lastert schmahend Jehovah. This seems to me to be the true idea - that this braggart or braggadocio did not make any pretensions to religion, but was a profane man, and one who despised God and abhorred His cause.<p>Whom the Load abhorreth - Or, more correctly, despises, or abhors the Lord. That is, he makes shameless boast of his own corrupt and base passions; when he is successful he makes no acknowledgment to God, but Curses him and despises or contemns him in his heart. A correct rendering then of the whole would be, "And having obtained, he curses - he despises Jehovah." Coverdale renders this, "The covetous blesseth himself, and blasphemeth the Lord." We have thus an example of lost finished and shameless depravity - but alas! One that was not found in the time of David only. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. heart's&#8212;or, "soul's."<p>desire&#8212;that is, his success in evil.<p>and blesseth, &c.&#8212;he (the wicked) blesseth the covetous, he despiseth the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Boasteth, </span> or <span class="ital">glorieth, or praiseth, or pleaseth himself</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of his heart’s desire; </span> or, <span class="ital">in</span>, or <span class="ital">concerning</span>, or <span class="ital">because of the desire</span>, or <span class="ital">concupiscence</span>, or <span class="ital">lust of his heart</span>, or <span class="ital">soul</span>; which word is added to note the vehemency and fervency of it.

As antichrist does of his universal power over all bishops and princes, which his heart was long desiring after; of his being Christ's vicar, Peter's successor, and head of the church; and of having power in heaven, earth, and hell: he boasts of his wealth and riches, of the righteousness and merits of saints, of works of supererogation, a stock of which he pretends to have in his hands to dispense to others: he boasts of his own holiness and infallibility, and of miracles, signs, and lying wonders done by his creatures, and of his great success in destroying those that oppose him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a>. The words may be rendered, "the wicked praiseth himself for the desire of his heart" (u), so the Chaldee paraphrase; to which agrees Jarchi's gloss, <p>"wicked Esau praiseth himself, because he hath obtained the desire of his soul:'' <p>and thus it is usual for proud, haughty, wicked men, as the Assyrian monarch, Nebuchadnezzar, and so the man of sin, to ascribe whatsoever they have or do to their own power and prudence; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>. Or they may be rendered, "he praiseth the wicked for his heart's desire" (w); or for his lusts, for his indulging them: for a wicked man not only delights in committing sin himself, but he also takes pleasure in those that do it; and some of the antichristian party have even wrote in commendation of the most unnatural lusts; <p>and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth: the covetous man is one that makes no use of what he has but for himself; and oftentimes withholds that which is meet from himself, as well as from others; and who makes use of unlawful ways to get, retain, and increase wealth, and is never satisfied: such an one God abhors, because he is an idolater, he has other gods before him; he worships his gold, be sets his affection on it, places his confidence in it, and expects protection and security from it, to a neglect of divine Providence; and yet the wicked man blesses him, calls his covetousness frugality and good husbandry; ascribes what he has to his diligence, care, and industry, and bestows gifts upon him. The words may be rendered, "the covetous man blesses himself" (x); with the good things he has laid up for many years; he pronounces himself blessed, and promises himself a great deal of happiness, in futurity; and ascribes all he has to his own hands. Or, "the covetous man curses, he abhors the Lord" (y); for the same word in the Hebrew language signifies to bless and curse, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>, which Aben Ezra on the place observes; and it is applicable enough to antichrist, who opens his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-6.htm">Revelation 13:6</a>. <p>(u)      "nam laudat improbus animam suam in desiderio ipsius", Junius &amp; Tremellius; so Michaelis.

The heathen receive the epithet of &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (which is more neuter than &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-22.htm">Psalm 50:22</a>); for God has not left them without a witness of Himself, that they could not know of Him, their alienation from God is a forgetfulness of Him, the guilt of which they have incurred themselves, and from which they are to turn to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-22.htm">Isaiah 19:22</a>). But because they do not do this, and even rise up in hostility against the nation and the God of the revelation that unfolds the plan of redemption, they will be obliged to return to the earth, and in fact to Hades, in order that the persecuted church may obtain its longed for peace and its promised dominion. Jahve will at last acknowledge this ecclesia pressa; and although its hope seems like to perish, inasmuch as it remains again and again unfulfilled, nevertheless it will not always continue thus. The strongly accented &#1500;&#1488; rules both members of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, and also frequently elsewhere (Ewald 351, a). &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, from &#1488;&#1489;&#1492; to wish, is one eager to obtain anything  equals  a needy person. The Arabic &#8219;ba&#770;, which means the very opposite, and according to which it would mean "one who restrains himself," viz., because he is obliged to, must be left out of consideration. </body></html>
