The mind of the psalmist, when he uttered these words, was evidently impressed “with such a veneration and awe of the infinite Jehovah, the fountain and support of universal life and being; and he found his faculties so swallowed up, and, as it were, lost in meditating on so deep and immense a subject; that man’s reason, in its utmost pride and glory, and with its most boasted improvements and acquisitions of knowledge, seemed now so debased, so weak, so narrow, and, in comparison with infinity, so despicable, that he could proceed no further without expressing his admiration at such a boundless scope of intelligence as he could neither explain nor comprehend:” see Foster’s <span class="ital">Discourses, </span>vol. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm" title="The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.">Psalm 1:4</a> to. p. 76.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>139:1-6 God has perfect knowledge of us, and all our thoughts and actions are open before him. It is more profitable to meditate on Divine truths, applying them to our own cases, and with hearts lifted to God in prayer, than with a curious or disputing frame of mind. That God knows all things, is omniscient; that he is every where, is omnipresent; are truths acknowledged by all, yet they are seldom rightly believed in by mankind. God takes strict notice of every step we take, every right step and every by step. He knows what rule we walk by, what end we walk toward, what company we walk with. When I am withdrawn from all company, thou knowest what I have in my heart. There is not a vain word, not a good word, but thou knowest from what thought it came, and with what design it was uttered. Wherever we are, we are under the eye and hand of God. We cannot by searching find how God searches us out; nor do we know how we are known. Such thoughts should restrain us from sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me - literally, "Wonderful knowledge away from me," or, more than I can comprehend.

After presenting the sublime doctrines of God's omnipresence and omniscience, the Psalmist appeals to Him, avowing his innocence, his abhorrence of the wicked, and his ready submission to the closest scrutiny. Admonition to the wicked and comfort to the pious are alike implied inferences from these doctrines.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I am so far from equalling thy knowledge, that I cannot apprehend it, in what manner thou dost so perfectly know all things, even such as are most secret, and have yet no being, and seem to depend upon many casualties and uncertainties. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/139.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,.... Meaning either the knowledge of himself, such as God had of him, which was vastly superior to what he had of himself; and especially the knowledge of other persons and things, whether visible or invisible, in heaven, earth, or hell; things past, present, and to come; or else the manner in which God knew all this was amazing to him, and quite impenetrable by him; that he did know him, his thoughts, his words and actions, and so those of all others, was easy of belief; but how he should know all this was past his conception, and struck him with the profoundest admiration; <p>it is high; sublime, out of his reach, beyond his comprehension; <p>I cannot attain unto it; neither to such knowledge, nor to comprehend what it is in God; and how he should have it, and in what manner he exercises it.

The beginning of this strophe calls <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> to mind. Though his way may lead through the midst of heart - oppressing trouble, Jahve will loose these bands of death and quicken him afresh (&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm">Psalm 30:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a>, and frequently). Though his enemies may rage, Jahve will stretch forth His hand threateningly and tranquillizingly over their wrath, and His right hand will save him. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; is the subject according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-10.htm">Psalm 139:10</a> and other passages, and not (for why should it be supposed to be this?) accus. instrumenti (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a> &#1497;&#1490;&#1502;&#1512; is intended just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a> : the word begun He will carry out, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>); and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; (according to its meaning, properly: covering me) is the same as &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; in that passage (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-6.htm">Psalm 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-8.htm">Psalm 142:8</a>). The pledge of this completion is Jahve's everlasting mercy, which will not rest until the promise is become perfect truth and reality. Thus, therefore, He will not leave, forsake the works of His hands (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-16.htm">Psalm 90:16</a>.), i.e., as Hengstenberg correctly explains, everything that He has hitherto accomplished for David, from his deliverance out of the hands of Saul down to the bestowment of the promise - He will not let one of His works stand still, and least of all one that has been so gloriously begun. &#1492;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; (whence &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1507;) signifies to slacken, to leave slack, i.e., leave uncarried out, to leave to itself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-3.htm">Nehemiah 6:3</a>. &#1488;&#1500; expresses a negation with a measure of inward excitement. </body></html>
