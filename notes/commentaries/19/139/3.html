The Hebrew verb means first <span class= "ital">to scatter, </span>and is used of throwing corn about to winnow it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm" title="The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.">Isaiah 30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-11.htm" title="At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,">Jeremiah 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-2.htm" title="And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley to night in the threshing floor.">Ruth 3:2</a>). Hence by an easy metaphor it may mean <span class= "ital">to sift </span>or <span class= "ital">search out. </span>The LXX. and Theodotion, followed by the Vulg., have <span class= "ital">traced, investigated. </span>Jerome has <span class= "ital">winnowed. </span>The Authorised Version rendering appears to come from a mistaken etymology.<p>A most plausible suggestion connects the verb with <span class= "ital">zûr, to lodge, </span>which makes a perfect parallelism with the verb <span class= "ital">to dwell, </span>in the next clause. Literally,<p>About my path and bed thou art a guest,<p>In all my ways thou dwellest;<p><span class= "ital">i.e., </span>art as familiar with all my life as one inhabiting the same house could be.<p><span class= "bld">My path.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">my going.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>139:1-6 God has perfect knowledge of us, and all our thoughts and actions are open before him. It is more profitable to meditate on Divine truths, applying them to our own cases, and with hearts lifted to God in prayer, than with a curious or disputing frame of mind. That God knows all things, is omniscient; that he is every where, is omnipresent; are truths acknowledged by all, yet they are seldom rightly believed in by mankind. God takes strict notice of every step we take, every right step and every by step. He knows what rule we walk by, what end we walk toward, what company we walk with. When I am withdrawn from all company, thou knowest what I have in my heart. There is not a vain word, not a good word, but thou knowest from what thought it came, and with what design it was uttered. Wherever we are, we are under the eye and hand of God. We cannot by searching find how God searches us out; nor do we know how we are known. Such thoughts should restrain us from sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou compassest my path ... - Margin, "winnowest." The Hebrew word - &#1494;&#1512;&#1492;  za&#770;ra&#770;h - means properly "to scatter," to cast loosely about - as the wind does dust; and then, to winnow - to wit, by throwing grain, when it is thrashed, up to the wind: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-24.htm">Isaiah 30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-2.htm">Ruth 3:2</a>. Then it means "to winnow out;" that is, to winnow out all the chaff, and to leave all the grain - to save all that is valuable. So here it means that God, as it were, "sifted" him. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>. He scattered all that was chaff, or all that was valueless, and saw what there was that was real and substantial. When it is said that he did this in his "path and his lying down," it is meant that he did it in every way; altogether; entirely.<p>And art acquainted with all my ways - All the paths that I tread; the whole course of my life. All that I do, in all places and at all times, is fully known to thee. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/139.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 139<p>Ps 139:1-24. After presenting the sublime doctrines of God's omnipresence and omniscience, the Psalmist appeals to Him, avowing his innocence, his abhorrence of the wicked, and his ready submission to the closest scrutiny. Admonition to the wicked and comfort to the pious are alike implied inferences from these doctrines.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou compassest my path; </span> thou watchest me on every side, and therefore discernest every step which I take.

The Targum adds, <p>"to study in the law.'' <p>His walk in the daytime, and every step he took, and his lying down at night. It denotes his perfect knowledge of all his actions, day and night; he surrounds every path of man, that they cannot escape his knowledge. Or, "thou winnowest", as some render the word (c); he distinguishes actions; he discerns and separates the good from the bad, or the goodness of an action from the evil and imperfection of it, as in winnowing the wheat is separated from the chaff. Or, "thou measurest my squaring" (d); all his dimensions, his length and breadth, as he lay down in his bed; <p>and art acquainted with all my ways; the whole of his life and conversation, all his works and doings: God knows all the evil ways and works of his people; he takes notice of them, and chastises for them; and all their good works, and approves and accepts of them; he knows from what principles of faith and love they spring, in what manner they are performed, and with what views, aims, and ends; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>. <p>(c) "ventilasti", Pagninus, Montanus; so Tigurine version and Ainsworth.

Just as &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; signifies impetuosity, vehemence, and then also a monster, so &#1492;&#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1489; signifies both to break in upon one violently and overpowerlingly (Sol 6:5; cf. Syriac arheb, Arabic arhaba, to terrify), and to make any one courageous, bold, and confident of victory. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1506;&#1494; forms a corollary to the verb that is marked by Mugrash or Dech: so that in my soul there was &#1506;&#1494;, i.e., power, viz., a consciousness of power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>). The thanksgiving, which he, the king of the promise, offers to God on account of this, will be transmitted to all the kings of the earth when they shall hear (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; in the sense of a fut. exactum) the words of His mouth, i.e., the divine &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, and they shall sing of (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1489;&#1468;, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-2.htm">Psalm 105:2</a> and frequently, &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a>, &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>, and the like) the ways of the God of the history of salvation, they shall sing that great is the glory of Jahve. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a> tells us by what means He has so super-gloriously manifested Himself in His leadings of David. He has shown Himself to be the Exalted One who is His all-embracing rule does not leave the lowly (cf. David's confessions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-22.htm">2 Samuel 6:22</a>) unnoticed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>), but on the contrary makes him the especial object of His regard; and on the other hand even from afar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>) He sees through (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-11.htm">Psalm 94:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>) the lofty one who thinks himself unobserved and conducts himself as if he were answerable to no higher being (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>). In correct texts &#1493;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492; has Mugrash, and &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; Mercha. The form of the fut. Kal &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is formed after the analogy of the Hiphil forms &#1497;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>, and frequently, and &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-21.htm">Job 24:21</a>; probably the word is intended to be all the more emphatic, inasmuch as the first radical, which disappears in &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, is thus in a certain measure restored.<p>(Note: The Greek imperfects with the double (syllabic and temporal) augment, as &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, are similar. Chajug&#769; also regards the first Jod in these forms as the preformative and the second as the radical, whereas Abulwald, Gramm. ch. xxvi. p. 170, explains the first as a prosthesis and the second as the preformative. According to the view of others, e.g., of Kimchi, &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; might be fut. Hiph. weakened from &#1497;&#1492;&#1491;&#1506; (&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;), which, apart from the unsuitable meaning, assumes a change of consonants that is all the more inadmissible as &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; itself springs from &#1493;&#1491;&#1506;. Nor is it to be supposed that &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is modified from &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; (Luzzatto, 197), because it is nowhere written &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;.) </body></html>
