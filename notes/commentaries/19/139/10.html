And yet the psalmist speaks here as if he were a guilty being trying to escape from the Divine notice. The truth is a profound one. Even when God discovers and overtakes those who guiltily try to hide from Him, it is to take them under His loving care.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>139:7-16 We cannot see God, but he can see us. The psalmist did not desire to go from the Lord. Whither can I go? In the most distant corners of the world, in heaven, or in hell, I cannot go out of thy reach. No veil can hide us from God; not the thickest darkness. No disguise can save any person or action from being seen in the true light by him. Secret haunts of sin are as open before God as the most open villanies. On the other hand, the believer cannot be removed from the supporting, comforting presence of his Almighty Friend. Should the persecutor take his life, his soul will the sooner ascend to heaven. The grave cannot separate his body from the love of his Saviour, who will raise it a glorious body. No outward circumstances can separate him from his Lord. While in the path of duty, he may be happy in any situation, by the exercise of faith, hope, and prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even there shall thy hand lead me - I shall find thee there; thy hand would be upon me; I should not have gone from thy presence.<p>And thy right hand shall hold me - Still hold me; still be laid upon me.

After presenting the sublime doctrines of God's omnipresence and omniscience, the Psalmist appeals to Him, avowing his innocence, his abhorrence of the wicked, and his ready submission to the closest scrutiny. Admonition to the wicked and comfort to the pious are alike implied inferences from these doctrines.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I could neither go thither without thy conduct, nor subsist there without thy powerful support, and much less could I go out of try sight; for a man may see many things which, are out of his power. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/139.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even there shall thy hand lead me,....

Further, as an Aramaizing feature we have the objective relation marked by Lamed in the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;, Thou understandest my thinking, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-11.htm">Psalm 135:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19</a>. The monostichic opening is after the Davidic style, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>. Among the prophets, Isaiah in particular is fond of such thematic introductions as we have here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>. On &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; instead of &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>; the pronominal object stands once beside the first verb, or even beside the second (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>), instead of twice (Hitzig). The "me" is then expanded: sitting down, rising up, walking and lying, are the sum of human conditions or states. &#1512;&#1506;&#1497; is the totality or sum of the life of the spirit and soul of man, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; the sum of human action. The divine knowledge, as &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; says, is the result of the scrutiny of man. The poet, however, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a> uses the perfect throughout as a mood of that which is practically existing, because that scrutiny is a scrutiny that is never unexecuted, and the knowledge is consequently an ever-present knowledge. &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; is meant to say that He sees into not merely the thought that is fully fashioned and matured, but even that which is being evolved. &#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; from &#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is combined by Luther (with Azulai and others) with &#1494;&#1512;, a wreath (from &#1494;&#1512;&#1512;, constringere, cingere), inasmuch as he renders: whether I walk or lie down, Thou art round about me (Ich gehe oder lige, so bistu umb mich). &#1494;&#1512;&#1492; ought to have the same meaning here, if with Wetzstein one were to compare the Arabic, and more particularly Beduin, drra&#770;, dherra&#770;, to protect; the notion of affording protection does not accord with this train of thought, which has reference to God's omniscience: what ought therefore to be meant is a hedging round which secures its object to the knowledge, or even a protecting that places it in security against any exchanging, which will not suffer the object to escape it.<p>(Note: This Verb. tert. Arab. w et y is old, and the derivative dhera&#770;, protection, is an elegant word; with reference to another derivative, dherwe, a wall of rock protecting one from the winds, vid., Job, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-7.htm">Job 24:7</a>, note. The II form (Piel) signifies to protect in the widest possible sense, e.g., (in Neshwn, ii. 343b), "[Arab.] dra&#770; 'l-s&#780;a&#770;h, he protected the sheep (against being exchanged) by leaving a lock of wool upon their backs when they were shorn, by which they might be recognised among other sheep.")<p>The Arabic d&#817;ra&#770;, to know, which is far removed in sound, is by no means to be compared; it is related to Arab. dr', to push, urge forward, and denotes knowledge that is gained by testing and experimenting. But we also have no need of that Arab. d&#817;ra&#770;, to protect, since we can remain within the range of the guaranteed Hebrew usage, inasmuch as &#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, to winnow, i.e., to spread out that which has been threshed and expose it to the current of the wind, in Arabic likewise d&#817;rra&#770;, (whence &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, midhra&#770;, a winnowing-fork, like &#1512;&#1495;&#1514;, racht, a winnowing-shovel), gives an appropriate metaphor. Here it is equivalent to: to investigate and search out to the very bottom; lxx, Symmachus, and Theodotion, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, after which the Italic renders investigasti, and Jerome eventilasti. &#1492;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; with the accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-21.htm">Job 22:21</a> with &#1506;&#1501;: to enter into neighbourly, close, familiar relationship, or to stand in such relationship, with any one; cogn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, Arab. skn. God is acquainted with all our ways not only superficially, but closely and thoroughly, as that to which He is accustomed.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a> this omniscience of God is illustratively corroborated with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a> has the value of a relative clause, which, however, takes the form of an independent clause. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (pronounced by Jerome in his letter to Sunnia and Fretela, 82, MALA) is an Aramaic word that has been already incorporated in the poetry of the Davidico-Salomonic age. &#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; signifies both all of it and every one. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-5.htm">Psalm 139:5</a> Luther has been misled by the lxx and Vulgate, which take &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; in the signification formare (whence &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, forma); it signifies, as the definition "behind and before" shows, to surround, encompass. God is acquainted with man, for He holds him surrounded on all sides, and man can do nothing, if God, whose confining hand he has lying upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-23.htm">Job 9:23</a>), does not allow him the requisite freedom of motion. Instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; (XX &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) the poet purposely says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a> merely &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;: a knowledge, so all-penetrating, all-comprehensive as God's knowledge. The Ker reads &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492;, but the Chethb &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is supported by the Chethb &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a>, the Ker of which there is not &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1488;, but &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; (the pausal form of an adjective &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, the feminine of which would be &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;). With &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; the transcendence, with &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; the unattainableness, and with &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; the incomprehensibleness of the fact of the omniscience of God is expressed, and with this, to the mind of the poet, coincides God's omnipresence; for true, not merely phenomenal, knowledge is not possible without the immanence of the knowing one in the thing known. God, however, is omnipresent, sustaining the life of all things by His Spirit, and revealing Himself either in love or in wrath - what the poet styles His countenance. To flee from this omnipresence (&#1502;&#1503;, away from), as the sinner and he who is conscious of his guilt would gladly do, is impossible. Concerning the first &#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, which is here accented on the ultima, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-4.htm">Psalm 116:4</a>. </body></html>
