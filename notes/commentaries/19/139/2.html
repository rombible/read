It is more profitable to meditate on Divine truths, applying them to our own cases, and with hearts lifted to God in prayer, than with a curious or disputing frame of mind. That God knows all things, is omniscient; that he is every where, is omnipresent; are truths acknowledged by all, yet they are seldom rightly believed in by mankind. God takes strict notice of every step we take, every right step and every by step. He knows what rule we walk by, what end we walk toward, what company we walk with. When I am withdrawn from all company, thou knowest what I have in my heart. There is not a vain word, not a good word, but thou knowest from what thought it came, and with what design it was uttered. Wherever we are, we are under the eye and hand of God. We cannot by searching find how God searches us out; nor do we know how we are known. Such thoughts should restrain us from sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/139.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou knowest my downsitting ... - In the various circumstances of life, thou knowest me. Thou knowest me in one place as well as in another. I cannot so change my position that thou will not see me, and that thou wilt not be perfectly acquainted with all that I say, and all that I do. In every posture, in every movement, in every occupation, thou hast a full knowledge of me. I cannot go out of thy sight; I cannot put myself into such a position that thou wilt not see me.<p>Thou understandest my thought - Hebrew, "As to my thought." That is, Thou seest what my plans are; what I design to do; "what I am thinking about." A most solemn reflection! How unwilling would bad people be - would even good people be - to have those round about them know always "what they are thinking about."<p>Afar off - Not when the "thought" is far off; but "thou," being far off, seest us as clearly as if thou wert near.

After presenting the sublime doctrines of God's omnipresence and omniscience, the Psalmist appeals to Him, avowing his innocence, his abhorrence of the wicked, and his ready submission to the closest scrutiny. Admonition to the wicked and comfort to the pious are alike implied inferences from these doctrines.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/139.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Known me, </span> i.e. known me exactly, as men do those things which they diligently search out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My downsitting and mine uprising; </span> all my postures and motions, my actions and my cessations from action. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My thought; </span> all my secret counsels and designs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Afar off; </span> before they are perfectly formed in my mind.

Here the psalmist proceeds to observe the particular circumstances and actions of his life, which were known to God; as his "downsitting", either to take rest, as weary persons do. Schultens (a) explains it of the quiet rest in sleep; this the Lord knew when he betook himself to it, and to whose care he committed himself and family; under whose protection he laid himself down, and on whom he depended for safety, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>. Or, since lying down to sleep is afterwards mentioned, this may respect sitting down at table to eat and drink; when the Lord knows whether men use the creatures aright, or abuse them; whether they receive their food with thankfulness, and eat and drink to the glory of God: or else this downsitting was to read the word of God, and meditate upon it; so the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"my sitting down to study the law.'' <p>When men do this, the Lord knows whether in reading they understand what they read, or read attentively and with affection; whether it is to their comfort and edification, and for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness; whether their meditation on it is sweet, and is attended with profit and pleasure. "Uprising" may respect either rising from bed, when the Lord knows whether the heart is still with him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-18.htm">Psalm 139:18</a>; what sense is had of the divine protection and sustentation, and what thankfulness there is for the mercies of the night past; and whether the voice of prayer and praise is directed to him in the morning, as it should be, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>; or else rising from the table, when the Lord knows whether a man's table has been his snare, and with what thankfulness he rises from it for the favours he has received. The Targum interprets this of rising up to go to war; which David did, in the name and strength, and by the direction, of the Lord; <p>thou understandest my thought afar off; God knows not only his own thoughts, but the thoughts of men, which none but themselves know; by this Christ appears to be truly God, the omniscient God, being a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-3.htm">Matthew 9:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>. God knows what thoughts his people have of him, and of his lovingkindness in Christ; what thoughts they have of Christ himself, his person, offices, and grace; what thoughts they have of themselves, their state, and condition: he knows all their vain thoughts, and complains of them, and which also they hate; and all their good thoughts, for they come from him. And he knows them "afar off", or "of old" (b), even before they are; so Aben Ezra interprets it, a long time past, and compares it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>; where the same word is rendered "of old": God knows the thoughts of his people, as well as his own, from all eternity; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>; as he knew what they would say and do, so what they would think; he knows thoughts that are past long ago, and forgotten by men, or were unobserved when thought; how else should he bring them into judgment? or though he is afar off in the highest heavens, yet he sees into the hearts of men, and is privy to all their thoughts. <p>(a) Animadv.

Just as &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; signifies impetuosity, vehemence, and then also a monster, so &#1492;&#1512;&#1492;&#1497;&#1489; signifies both to break in upon one violently and overpowerlingly (Sol 6:5; cf. Syriac arheb, Arabic arhaba, to terrify), and to make any one courageous, bold, and confident of victory. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1506;&#1494; forms a corollary to the verb that is marked by Mugrash or Dech: so that in my soul there was &#1506;&#1494;, i.e., power, viz., a consciousness of power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>). The thanksgiving, which he, the king of the promise, offers to God on account of this, will be transmitted to all the kings of the earth when they shall hear (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; in the sense of a fut. exactum) the words of His mouth, i.e., the divine &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, and they shall sing of (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1489;&#1468;, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-2.htm">Psalm 105:2</a> and frequently, &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a>, &#1492;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">Psalm 20:8</a>, and the like) the ways of the God of the history of salvation, they shall sing that great is the glory of Jahve. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a> tells us by what means He has so super-gloriously manifested Himself in His leadings of David. He has shown Himself to be the Exalted One who is His all-embracing rule does not leave the lowly (cf. David's confessions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-22.htm">2 Samuel 6:22</a>) unnoticed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-6.htm">Psalm 113:6</a>), but on the contrary makes him the especial object of His regard; and on the other hand even from afar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>) He sees through (&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-11.htm">Psalm 94:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>) the lofty one who thinks himself unobserved and conducts himself as if he were answerable to no higher being (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>). In correct texts &#1493;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492; has Mugrash, and &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511; Mercha. The form of the fut. Kal &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is formed after the analogy of the Hiphil forms &#1497;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>, and frequently, and &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-21.htm">Job 24:21</a>; probably the word is intended to be all the more emphatic, inasmuch as the first radical, which disappears in &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, is thus in a certain measure restored.<p>(Note: The Greek imperfects with the double (syllabic and temporal) augment, as &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, are similar. Chajug&#769; also regards the first Jod in these forms as the preformative and the second as the radical, whereas Abulwald, Gramm. ch. xxvi. p. 170, explains the first as a prosthesis and the second as the preformative. According to the view of others, e.g., of Kimchi, &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; might be fut. Hiph. weakened from &#1497;&#1492;&#1491;&#1506; (&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;), which, apart from the unsuitable meaning, assumes a change of consonants that is all the more inadmissible as &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; itself springs from &#1493;&#1491;&#1506;. Nor is it to be supposed that &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is modified from &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; (Luzzatto, 197), because it is nowhere written &#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;.) </body></html>
