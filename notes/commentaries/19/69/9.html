So at least one applied the words long after, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm" title="And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.">John 2:17</a> (where see Note in <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the reproaches.</span>—See St. Paul’s application of these words <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm" title="For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me.">Romans 15:3</a>.

Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up - My zeal - my ardor - in the cause of religion (that is, of thy pure worship) has been so great as to consume me.

This passage is quoted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, and applied to the Saviour, not as having had originally a reference to him, but as language which would accurately describe his character.

This whole verse, though truly belonging to David, yet was also directed by him, at least by the Spirit of God in him, to a higher use, to represent the disposition and condition of Christ, in whom this was more truly and fully accomplished than in David; to whom therefore it is applied in the New Testament, the first part of it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm" title="And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.">John 2:17</a></span>, and the latter, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm" title="For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me.">Romans 15:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/69.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up,.... Of the house of the sanctuary, as the Targum; that is, the temple, which was Christ's Father's house, where he was worshipped and dwelt; and zeal for his Father, and his glory in it, and indignation against those that made it an house of merchandise, inflamed him; put him upon driving out the buyers and sellers in it, whereby this passage had its accomplishment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-14.htm">John 2:14</a>; and this may be applied to the church of God which is the house of God, of his building, and where he dwells; and zeal may design the fervent affection of Christ for it, for the doctrine, discipline, and salvation of it. His zeal for the Gospel appeared in his warm and lively preaching it, in his assiduity and constancy in it; in the wearisome journeys he took to spread it, in the risks he run, and dangers he exposed himself to, for the sake of it; in the miracles he wrought to confirm it, and in the care he took to free it from calumny and reproach: his zeal for the worship and discipline of God's house was shown by his asserting the purity of worship in spirit and truth; by his severe inveighing against the traditions, superstition, and will worship of men, and against the vices and corruptions of professors of religion, the Scribes and Pharisees: his zeal for the salvation of his people is easily seen in his suretyship engagements for them; in coming into this world to do the will of him that sent him; in his early regards unto it, and vehement desire, even of suffering death, in order to accomplish it, and in his voluntary and cheerful submission and obedience, even to the death of the cross: this zeal of his was according to knowledge, and was cordial, hearty, and unfeigned; and this "eat him up": inflamed like fire his spirit and affections; consumed his time and strength, and even life itself; <p>and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me: the same persons that reproached the one reproached the other; and the reproaches of his divine Father were as cutting to him as if cast on himself; it went to his heart that his Father's house should be made an house of merchandise; that his doctrine should be despised, his worship neglected, and his glory lessened; to have the name of God, his ways and truth, evil spoken of, were not pleasing to him; he took all reproach of this kind to himself, and bore it becomingly; and yet showed zeal for his Father's glory, and indignation against those that reproached him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/69.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{i}</span> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</span><p>(i) When I saw your enemies claim your Name in mouth only, and in their life deny the same, your Holy Spirit thrust me forward to reprove them and defend your glory.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/69.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. His jealousy for the honour of God’s house was like a consuming fire within him. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-139.htm" title="My zeal has consumed me, because my enemies have forgotten your words.">Psalm 119:139</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-3.htm" title="My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spoke I with my tongue,">Psalm 39:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm" title="Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.">Jeremiah 20:9</a>. It is difficult to determine whether ‘thine house’ means the Temple only, or as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm" title="Set the trumpet to your mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.">Hosea 8:1</a>, bears the wider meaning of the land or the people of Israel. (1) In the former case the reference may be to the burning indignation which was stirred by the sight of abominations such as those which Ezekiel describes as polluting the Temple (ch. 8); and it is noteworthy that he particularly mentions “the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy,” i.e. some image or symbol which was a direct challenge of the “jealous God” who could brook no rival, and which must have stirred the grief and indignation of His faithful servants. (2) In the latter case it is the general condition of the nation, the contrast between its calling to be a holy nation and the universal corruption prevalent, which stirs his deepest emotion. This alternative gains some support from Jeremiah’s usage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm" title="What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.">Jeremiah 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm" title="I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.">Jeremiah 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-11.htm" title="For both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The zeal of Christ for His Father’s desecrated house recalled these words to the minds of His disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm" title="And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.">John 2:17</a> : the reading of the true text follows the LXX (B), <span class="ital">shall eat me up</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the reproaches</span> &c.] Better as R.V., the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me. On the one hand their blasphemies against God wound and crush the spirit of His servant; and on the other hand they shew their contempt for God by their mockery of His servant. Such was Jeremiah’s experience: his contemporaries mocked God’s message, and mocked him for delivering it (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-10.htm" title="Let all my enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.">Psalm 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm" title="They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.">Psalm 20:8</a>): such too was the experience of Christ Himself, to whom St Paul applies these words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm" title="For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me.">Romans 15:3</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/69.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</span> David's "zeal for God's house" was shown, first, in his establishment of the tabernacle on Mount Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-19</a>); next, in his earnest desire to build a permanent and magnificent dwelling for the ark of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-2.htm">Psalm 132:2-5</a>); then, in his careful collection of materials for the building which he was forbidden to erect himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2-5</a>); and finally, in the directions that he left to Solomon with respect to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9, 10, 20</a>).

The waters are said to rush in unto the soul (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;), when they so press upon the imperilled one that the soul, i.e., the life of the body, more especially the breath, is threatened; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-6.htm">Jonah 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>.

The soft, yielding morass is called &#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, and the eddying deep &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;.

Distinct from this use of the participle without the article is the adverbially qualifying participle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; Sol 5:2, cf. &#1495;&#1497;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-21.htm">2 Samuel 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>.

Apart from the words "more than the hairs of my head" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>), the complaint of the multitude of groundless enemies is just the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-3.htm">Psalm 109:3</a>, both in substance and expression. Instead of &#1502;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, my destroyers, the Syriac version has the reading &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (more numerous than my bones), which is approved by Hupfeld; but to reckon the multitude of the enemy by the number of one's own bones is both devoid of taste and unheard of. Moreover the reading of our text finds support, if it need any, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>. The words, "what I have not taken away, I must then restore," are intended by way of example, and perhaps, as also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, as a proverbial expression: that which I have not done wrong, I must suffer for (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, and the similar complaint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>). One is tempted to take &#1488;&#1494; in the sense of "nevertheless" (Ewald), a meaning, however, which it is by no means intended to convey. In this passage it takes the place of &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; for &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>), inasmuch as it gives prominence to the restitution desired, as an inference from a false assumption: then, although I took it not away, stole it not.<p>The transition from the bewailing of suffering to a confession of sin is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>. In the undeserved persecution which he endures at the hand of man, he is obliged nevertheless to recognise well-merited chastisement from the side of God. And whilst by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-16.htm">Jeremiah 17:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>, and on &#1500; as an exponent of the object, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2</a>) he does not acknowledge himself to be a sinner after the standard of his own shortsightedness, but of the divine omniscience, he at the same time commends his sinful need, which with self-accusing modesty he calls &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a>) and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;    (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-10.htm">2 Chronicles 28:10</a>), to the mercy of the omniscient One. Should he, the sinner, be abandoned by God to destruction, then all those who are faithful in their intentions towards the Lord would be brought to shame and confusion in him, inasmuch as they would be taunted with this example. &#1511;&#1493;&#1497;&#1498; designates the godly from the side of the &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;a from the side of the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;. The multiplied names of God are so many appeals to God's honour, to the truthfulness of His covenant relationship. The person praying here is, it is true, a sinner, but that is no justification of the conduct of men towards him; he is suffering for the Lord's sake, and it is the Lord Himself who is reviled in him. It is upon this he bases his prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, for thy sake, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>. The reproach that he has to bear, and ignominy that has covered his face and made it quite unrecognisable (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-16.htm">Psalm 44:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-17.htm">Psalm 83:17</a>), have totally estranged (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/38-12.htm">Psalm 38:12</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-9.htm">Psalm 88:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-6.htm">Jeremiah 12:6</a>) from him even his own brethren (&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;, parallel word &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm">Psalm 50:20</a>; cf. on the other hand, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8</a>, where the interchange designedly takes another form of expression); for the glow of his zeal (&#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468; from &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;, according to the Arabic, to be a deep or bright red) for the house of Jahve, viz., for the sanctity of the sanctuary and of the congregation gathered about it (which is never directly called "the house of Jahve" in the Old Testament, vid., Khler on <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-8.htm">Zechariah 9:8</a>, but here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>, is so called in conjunction with the sanctuary), as also for the honour of His who sits enthroned therein, consumes him, like a fire burning in his bones which incessantly breaks forth and rages all through him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>), and therefore all the malice of those who are estranged from God is concentrated upon and against him.<p>He now goes on to describe how sorrow for the sad condition of the house of God has brought noting but reproach to him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm">Psalm 109:24</a>.). It is doubtful whether &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is an alternating subject to &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (fut. consec. without being apocopated), cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>, or a more minutely defining accusative as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a> (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>), or whether, together with &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, it forms a circumstantial clause (et flevi dum in jejunio esset anima mea), or even whether it is intended to be taken as an accusative of the object in a pregnant construction ( equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-15.htm">1 Samuel 1:15</a>): I wept away my soul in fasting. Among all these possible renderings, the last is the least probable, and the first, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/83-19.htm">Psalm 83:19</a>, by far the most probable, and also that which is assumed by the accentuation.<p>(Note: The Munach of &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1501; is a transformation of Dech (just as the Munach of &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; is a transformation of Mugrash), in connection with which &#1504;&#1511;&#1513;&#1497; might certainly be conceived of even as object (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>); but this after &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (not &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;), and as being without example, could hardly have entered the minds of the punctuists.)<p>The reading of the lxx &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1; (Olshausen, Hupfeld, and Bttcher), is a very natural (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>) exchange of the poetically bold expression for one less choice and less expressive (since &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is a phrase of the Pentateuch equivalent to &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The garb of mourning, like the fasting, is an expression of sorrow for public distresses, not, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>, of personal condolence; concerning &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>. On account of this mourning, reproach after reproach comes upon him, and they fling gibes and raillery at him; everywhere, both in the gate, the place where the judges sit and where business is transacted, and also at carousals, he is jeered at and traduced (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-14.htm">Lamentations 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; signifies in itself fabulari de... without any bad secondary meaning (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>, confabulabitur tecum); here it is construed first with a personal and then a neuter subject (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>), for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a> neither &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>) nor &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-63.htm">Lamentations 3:63</a>) is to be supplied. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> tells us how he acts in the face of such hatred and scorn; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, sarcasmis hostium suam opponit in precibus constantiam (Geier). As for himself, his prayer is directed towards Jahve at the present time, when his affliction as a witness for God gives him the assurance that He will be well-pleased to accept it (&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1489;&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). It is addressed to Him who is at the same time Jahve and Elohim, - the revealed One in connection with the history of redemption, and the absolute One in His exaltation above the world, - on the ground of the greatness and fulness of His mercy: may He then answer him with or in the truth of His salvation, i.e., the infallibility with which His purpose of mercy verifies itself in accordance with the promises given. Thus is <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> to be explained in accordance with the accentuation. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, it looks as though &#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; must be drawn to &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (Hitzig), but <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> sets us right on this point; and the fact that &#1489;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1498; is joined to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> also finds support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>. But the repetition of the divine name perplexes one, and it may be asked whether or not the accent that divides the verse into its two parts might not more properly stand beside &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> beside &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;; so that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> runs: Elohim, by virtue of the greatness of Thy mercy hear me, by virtue of the truth of Thy salvation. </body></html>
