Here, however, it seems to touch a higher chord of feeling and to approach the true Churchmanship—the <span class= "ital">esprit de corps </span>of the Kingdom of Heaven—which attaches a greater heinousness to the sin because it may harm the brethren. Not only would Jehovah be dishonoured in the sight of the heathen if He seemed to be disregarding His part of the covenant, but for an Israelite to have violated his part brought shame on all Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/69.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-6.htm" title="Let not them that wait on you, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek you be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.">Psalm 69:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let not them that wait on thee — </span>The truly pious, who believe thy promises, and look to thee for the fulfilment of them; who are conscious of their own weakness, and of the insufficiency of all human aid, and therefore apply to thee, and trust in thee for the help they want; <span class="ital">be ashamed — </span>That is, frustrated of their just and reasonable expectations, which would make them ashamed of their past confidence in thee, and either to look up to thee in future, or to look upon their enemies with assurance, when they shall reproach them for their trust in thee; <span class="ital">for my sake — </span>Because of my sad disappointments. For, if they see me forsaken, they will be discouraged by this example; or, let them not hang down their heads for shame to see me, who am thy worshipper, deserted of thee. He was afraid, if God did not appear for him, it would be a discouragement to other pious people, and give their enemies cause to triumph over them; and it was his earnest desire, whatever became of himself, that all the true people of God might retain their confidence and hope in God, and their boldness in his cause, and neither be discouraged in themselves, nor exposed to contempt from others.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>69:1-12 We should frequently consider the person of the Sufferer here spoken of, and ask why, as well as what he suffered, that, meditating thereon, we may be more humbled for sin, and more convinced of our danger, so that we may feel more gratitude and love, constraining us to live to His glory who died for our salvation. Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let not them that wait on thee - Those who worship thee; those who are thy true friends. True piety is often, in the Scriptures, represented as waiting on the Lord. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>.<p>Be ashamed for my sake - On account of me; or, in consequence of what I do. Let me not be suffered to do anything that would make them ashamed of me, or ashamed to have it known that I belong to their number. I know that I am a sinner; I know that judgments come justly on me; I know that if left to myself I shall fall into sin, and shall dishonor religion; and I pray, therefore, that I may be kept from acting out the depravity of my heart, and bringing dishonor on the cause that I profess to love. No one who knows the evil of his own heart can fail to see the propriety of this prayer; no one who remembers how often people high in the church, and zealous in their professed piety, fall into sin, and disgrace their profession, can help feeling that what has happened to others "may" happen to him also, and that he has need of special prayer, and special grace, that he may go down into the grave at last without having brought dishonor upon religion.<p>Let not those that seek thee - Another phrase to denote people of true piety - as those who are "seeking" after God; that is, who are desirous of understanding his character, and obtaining his favor.<p>Be confounded for my sake - Let them not feel "disgraced" in me; let them not feel it a dishonor to have it said that I am one of their number, or that I profess to be united to them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/69.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. for my sake&#8212;literally, "in me," in my confusion and shame.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Them that wait on thee, </span> i.e. thy godly people, who rely upon thy promises which thou hast made to all thine in general, and to me in a special manner, wherein they also are concerned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ashamed, </span> i.e. frustrated of their just hopes; which will make them ashamed, either to look upon God, or to look upon their enemies, when they shall reproach them for their confidence in God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For my sake; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Of their expectation of redemption and salvation by the Messiah, they have been waiting upon the Lord for; when they shall see him in suffering circumstances, and even dead and laid in the grave, without any hope of his rising again; which was the case of the two disciples travelling to Emmaus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-19.htm">Luke 24:19</a>; whose trust in him, and expectation of him, as the Redeemer of Israel, were almost gone. The people of God, and believers in Christ, are described by such that "wait on the Lord"; for the coming of Christ, and salvation by him; who would be in danger of being put to shame and in confusion, when they should see him under the power of death and the grave; wherefore in this petition Christ addresses his divine Father as "the Lord God of hosts", of armies above and below, as God omnipotent; partly to encourage their trust and confidence in him, and partly to encourage his own faith as man, that this petition would be answered; <p>let not those that seek thee: in the word and ordinances, by prayer and supplication, with all their hearts, in Christ, in whom the Lord is only to be found, and for life and happiness: <p>be confounded for my sake; that is, through his sufferings and death, as before: <p>O God of Israel; the covenant God of the spiritual Israel, whom he has chosen, the Messiah redeems, and the Spirit makes Israelites indeed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/69.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</span><p>(h) Do not let my evil entreaty of the enemy be an opportunity for the faithful to fall from you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/69.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

The heavens of heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>) are by &#1511;&#1491;&#1501; described as primeval (perhaps, following the order of their coming into existence, as extending back beyond the heavens that belong to our globe, of the second and fourth day of Creation). God is said to ride along in the primeval heavens of the heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>), when by means of the cherub (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>) He extends His operations to all parts of these infinite distances and heights. The epithet "who rideth along in the heavens of heavens of the first beginning" denotes the exalted majesty of the superterrestrial One, who on account of His immanency in history is called "He who rideth along through the steppes" (&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>). In &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493; we have a repetition of the thought expressed above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a> by &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;; what is intended is God's voice of power, which thunders down everything that contends against Him. Since in the expression &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-8.htm">Jeremiah 12:8</a>) the voice, according to Ges. 138, rem. 3, note, is conceived of as the medium of the giving, i.e., of the giving forth from one's self, of the making one's self heard, we must take &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1506;&#1494; not as the object (as in the Latin phrase sonitum dare), but as an apposition: <p>(Note: The accentuation does not decide; it admits of our taking it in both ways. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-2.htm">Psalm 41:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-7.htm">Psalm 58:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm">Psalm 68:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>.)<p>behold, He maketh Himself heard with His voice, a powerful voice. Thus let them then give God &#1506;&#1494;, i.e., render back to Him in praise that acknowledges His omnipotence, the omnipotence which He hath, and of which He gives abundant proof. His glory (&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;) rules over Israel, more particularly as its guard and defence; His power (&#1506;&#1494;), however, embraces all created things, not the earth merely, but also the loftiest regions of the sky. The kingdom of grace reveals the majesty and glory of His redemptive work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>), the kingdom of nature the universal dominion of His omnipotence. To this call to the kingdoms of the earth they respond in v. 36: "Awful is Elohim out of thy sanctuaries." The words are addressed to Israel, consequently &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is not the heavenly and earthly sanctuary (Hitzig), but the one sanctuary in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-72.htm">Ezekiel 21:72</a>) in the manifold character of its holy places (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-51.htm">Jeremiah 51:51</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>). Commanding reverence - such is the confession of the Gentile world - doth Elohim rule from thy most holy places, O Israel, the God who hath chosen thee as His mediatorial people. The second part of the confession runs: the God of Israel giveth power and abundant strength to the people, viz., whose God He is, equivalent to &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-11.htm">Psalm 29:11</a>. Israel's might in the omnipotence of God it is which the Gentile world has experienced, and from which it has deduced the universal fact of experience, v. 36b. All peoples with their gods succumb at last to Israel and its God. This confession of the Gentile world closes with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (which is preceded by Mugrash transformed out of Athnach). That which the psalmist said in the name of Israel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>, "Blessed be the Lord," now re-echoes from all the world, "Blessed be Elohim." The world is overcome by the church of Jahve, and that not merely in outward form, but spiritually. The taking up of all the kingdoms of the world into the kingdom of God, this the great theme of the Apocalypse, is also after all the theme of this Psalm. The first half closed with Jahve's triumphant ascension, the second closes with the results of His victory and triumph, which embrace the world of peoples. </body></html>
