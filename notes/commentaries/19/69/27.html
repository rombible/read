The former supposition certainly adds a fresh force to the prayer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-29.htm" title="But I am poor and sorrowful: let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.">Psalm 69:29</a>; and it is more natural to suppose that the string of curses, once ended, should not be taken up again. On the other hand, would the apostates, against whom the psalm is directed, have put their animosity into the shape of a wish to have names blotted out of God’s book? If so, it must be in irony.<p>(27) <span class= "bld">Add iniquity</span>—This may be understood in two different senses: (1) <span class= "ital">Let sin be added to sin in thy account, till the tale be full. </span>(2) <span class= "ital">Add guilt for guilt, i.e., for each wrong committed write down a punishment.</span><p><span class= "bld">And let them not . . .</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>let them not be justified in thy sight; not gain their cause at thy tribunal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/69.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-27.htm" title="Add iniquity to their iniquity: and let them not come into your righteousness.">Psalm 69:27</a></span>. <span class="ital">Add iniquity to their iniquity — </span>Or, <span class="ital">give </span>or <span class="ital">permit, </span>as <span class="greekheb">תנה</span>, <span class="ital">tenah, </span>may be properly rendered.

Verses 22,23, are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelieving Jews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel of sin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; their punishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up to their own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God's great salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignation will be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon for it. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, through the righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from that righteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shut themselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that they will not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doom accordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect any benefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better to be poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich and jovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was, when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; but God exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor and sorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Add iniquity unto their iniquity - Margin, "punishment of iniquity." The literal rendering is, "Give iniquity upon their iniquity." Luther understands this as a prayer that "sin may be made a punishment for sin;" that is, that they may, as a punishment for their former sins, be left to commit still more aggravated crimes, and thus draw on themselves severer punishment. So Rosenmuller renders it, "Suffer them to accumulate sins by rushing from one sin to another, until their crimes are matured, and their destined punishment comes upon them." An idea similar to this occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>, where God is represented as having "given the pagan over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient" fit, or proper - "because they did not like to retain him in their knowledge." Perhaps this is the most natural interpretation here, though another has been suggested which the original will bear. According to that, there is an allusion here to the double sense of the equivocal term rendered "iniquity" - &#1506;&#1493;&#1503;  &#8219;a&#770;vo&#770;n - which properly denotes sin as such, or in itself considered, but which sometimes seems to denote sin in its consequences or effects. This latter is the interpretation adopted by Prof. Alexander. Thus understood, it is a prayer that God would add, or give, to their sin that which sin deserved; or, in other words, that he would punish it "as" it deserved.<p>And let them not come into thy righteousness - Let them not be treated "as" righteous; as those who are regarded by "thee" as righteous. Let them be treated as they deserve. This is the same as praying that a murderer may not be treated as an innocent man; a burglar, as if he were a man of peace; or a dishonest man, as if he were honest. Let people be regarded and treated as they "are in fact;" or, as they deserve to be treated. It seems difficult to see why this prayer may not be offered with propriety, and with a benevolent heart - for to bring this about is what all officers of justice are endeavoring to accomplish. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/69.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27, 28. iniquity&#8212;or, "punishment of iniquity" (Ps 40:12).<p>come &#8230; righteousness&#8212;partake of its benefits.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Add iniquity to their iniquity; </span> give them up to their own vain minds and vile lusts, and to a reprobate sense, and take off all the restraints of thy grace and providence, and expose them to the temptations of the world and of the devil, that so they may grow worse and worse, and at last may fill up the measure of their sins; as is said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a></span>: compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>,29</span>.

Let them alone in sin; suffer them to go on in it; lay no restraints upon them; put no stop in providence in their way; let them proceed from one evil to another, till they fall into ruin: to their natural and acquired hardness of heart, give them up to a judicial hardness; that they may do things that are not convenient, and be damned. Suffer them not to stop at the crucifixion of the Messiah; let them go on to persecute his apostles and followers; to show the utmost spite and malice against the Christian religion; to embrace false Christs, and blaspheme the true one; to believe the greatest lies and absurdities, and commit the foulest of actions; as seditions, rapines, murders, &amp;c. as they did while Jerusalem was besieged; that they may fill up the measure of their sins, and wrath may come upon them to the uttermost, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:15</a>.

Or rather, the righteousness of Christ, which is called the righteousness of God, that is, the Father; because he approves and accepts of it, and imputes it to his people without works: and seeing the Jews sought for justification by their own works, and went about to establish their own righteousness, and submitted not to Christ's, but despised and rejected it; it was but just that they should be excluded from all benefit and advantage by it, as is here imprecated.

"To give wormwood for meat and &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; to drink" is a Jeremianic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>) designation for inflicting the extreme of pain and anguish upon one. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;) signifies first of all a poisonous plant with an umbellated head of flower or a capitate fruit; but then, since bitter and poisonous are interchangeable notions in the Semitic languages, it signifies gall as the bitterest of the bitter. The lxx renders: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Certainly &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468; can mean to put something into something, to mix something with it, but the parallel word &#1500;&#1510;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497; (for my thirst, i.e., for the quenching of it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-15.htm">Nehemiah 9:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>) favours the supposition that the &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; is Beth essentiae, after which Luther renders: "they give me gall to eat." The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;) signifies &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (root &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;, Sanscrit gar, Latin vor-are). </body></html>
