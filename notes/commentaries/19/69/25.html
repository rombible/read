Verses 22,23, are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelieving Jews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel of sin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; their punishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up to their own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God's great salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignation will be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon for it. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, through the righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from that righteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shut themselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that they will not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doom accordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect any benefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better to be poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich and jovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was, when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; but God exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor and sorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let their habitation be desolate - Margin, "their palace." The Hebrew word means properly a wall; then, a fortress or castle; and then it means also a nomadic encampment, a rustic village, a farm-hamlet. The word conveys the idea of an "enclosure," with special reference to an encampment, or a collection of tents. The Septuagint renders it here &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  epaulis, meaning a place to pass the night in, especially for flocks and herds. The Hebrew word - &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;  t&#803;&#305;&#770;yra&#770;h - is rendered "castles" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-10.htm">Numbers 31:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-54.htm">1 Chronicles 6:54</a>; "palaces" in Sol 8:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a>; "rows" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-23.htm">Ezekiel 46:23</a>; and "habitation" in this place. It does not occur elsewhere. Here it means their "home," - their place of abode, - but with no particular reference to the "kind" of home, whether a palace, a castle, or an encampment. The idea is, that the place which they had occupied, or where they had dwelt, would be made vacant. They would be removed, and the place would be solitary and forsaken. It is equivalent to a prayer that they might be destroyed.<p>And let none dwell in their tents - Margin, as in Hebrew, "let there not be a dweller." That is, Let their tents where they had dwelt be wholly forsaken. This passage is quoted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>, as applicable to Judas.
