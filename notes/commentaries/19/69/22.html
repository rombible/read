The sacrifices, peace- offerings, and other oblations of the Jews, were, in a remarkable manner, a snare to them, in that their dependence on them, and their conceit of the everlastingness of the Mosaic dispensation, was one chief cause of their rejection of Christ.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>69:22-29 These are prophecies of the destruction of Christ's persecutors. Verses 22,23, are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelieving Jews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel of sin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; their punishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up to their own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God's great salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignation will be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon for it. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, through the righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from that righteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shut themselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that they will not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doom accordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect any benefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better to be poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich and jovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was, when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; but God exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor and sorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let their table become a snare before them - These verses are quoted by Paul <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9-10</a> as descriptive of the character of persons in his time, or as "language" which would express what he desired to say. See the passage explained at length in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9-10</a>. The whole passage is a prayer that they might receive a proper recompense for what they had done. The word "table" here means the table at which they were accustomed to eat. As they refused food to a hungry man, the prayer is, that they might find the recompense for their conduct "in that very line;" or that, as they refused food to the hungry, they might find "their" food a "snare" to them. That is, Let it be the means of punishing them for their not giving wholesome food to the hungry, or for their offering poisonous herbs to a starving man. The word "snare" here means unexpected danger; danger sprung suddenly upon them - as a snare is upon a wild beast.<p>And that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap - Much of this is supplied by the translators. The literal rendering would be, "And to those at peace (or secure) a trap." The word here rendered "welfare" is the plural form of the word meaning "peace," and may denote those who feel that they are at peace; that they are secure; that they are in no danger. The ancient versions give it the sense of "requitals," that is, a recompence for their transgressions; but the other signification best accords with the connection. The word "trap" is usually applied to the devices for capturing wild beasts, and the meaning is, "Let the recompence come suddenly upon them, while they think themselves at peace, or when they are surrounded by all the comforts and luxuries of life." This prayer is such as occurs frequently in the Psalms. It cannot be "proved" that it was uttered in a malignant spirit, or that anything more is intended by it than that the psalmist desired that justice might be done to all people - an object which all magistrates, and all good citizens, should pray for.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/69.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23. With unimportant verbal changes, this language is used by Paul to describe the rejection of the Jews who refused to receive the Saviour (Ro 11:9, 10). The purport of the figures used is that blessings shall become curses, the "table" of joy (as one of food) a "snare," their<p>welfare&#8212;literally, "peaceful condition," or security, a "trap." Darkened eyes and failing strength complete the picture of the ruin falling on them under the invoked retribution.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/69.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.<p>23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.<p>24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.<p>25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.<p>26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.<p>27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.<p>28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.<p>From this point David and our Lord for awhile part company, if we accept the rendering of our version. The severe spirit of the law breathes out imprecations, while the tender heart of Jesus offers prayers for his murderers. The whole of these verses, however, may be viewed as predictions, and then they certainly refer to our Lord, for we find portions of them quoted in that manner by the apostle in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-9.htm">Matthew 11:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-10.htm">Matthew 11:10</a>, and by Christ himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-22.htm">Psalm 69:22</a><p>"Let their table become a snare before them." There they laid snares, and there they shall find them. From their feasts they would afford nothing but wormwood for their innocent victim, and now their banquets shall be their ruin. It is very easy for the daily provisions of mercy to become temptations to sin. As birds and beasts are taken in a trap by means of baits for the appetite, so are men snared full often by their meats and drinks. Those who despise the upper springs of grace, shall find the nether springs of worldly comfort prove their poison. The table is used, however, not alone for feeding, but for conversation, transacting business, counsel, amusement, and religious observance: to those who are the enemies of the Lord Jesus the table may, in all these respects, become a snare. This first plague is terrible, and the second is like unto it. "And that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap." This, if we follow the original closely, and the version of Paul in the Romans, is a repetition of the former phrase; but we shall not err if we say that, to the rejectors of Christ, even those things which are calculated to work their spiritual and eternal good, become occasions for yet greater sin. They reject Christ, and are condemned for not believing on him; they stumble on this stone, and are broken by it. Wretched are those men, who not only have a curse upon their common blessings, but also on the spiritual opportunities of salvation.<p>"Whom oils and balsams kill, what salve can cure?"<p>This second plague even exceeds the first.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-23.htm">Psalm 69:23</a><p>"Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not." They shall wander in a darkness that may be felt. They have loved darkness rather than light, and in darkness they shall abide. Judicial blindness fell upon Israel after our Lord's death and their persecution of his apostles; they were blinded by the light which they would not accept. Eyes which see no beauty in the Lord Jesus, but flash wrath upon him, may well grow yet more dim, till death spiritual leads to death eternal. "And make their loins continually to shake." Their conscience shall be so ill at ease that they shall continually quiver with fear; their backs shall bend to the earth (so some read it) with grovelling avarice, and their strength shall be utterly paralyzed, so that they cannot walk firmly, but shall totter at every step. See the terrifying, degrading, and enfeebling influence of unbelief. See also the retaliations of justice: those who will not see shall not see; those who would not walk in uprightness shall be unable to do so.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These and the following words, which are expressed in the form of imprecations, are thought by divers to be and that the imperatives are put for the as sometimes they are. And accordingly they translate the words thus, <span class="ital">Their table shall become a snare</span>, But if they be imprecations, here was sufficient cause for them.

This and the following imprecations were not the effects of a spirit of private revenge; of which there was no appearance in Christ, but all the reverse who prayed for his enemies, while they were using him as above related: but they are prophecies of what should be, being delivered out under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a>. Wherefore some versions render the words, "their table shall become a snare" (h); and therefore are not to be drawn into an example by us, to favour and encourage a revengeful spirit: and they are very just and righteous, according to "lex talionis", the law of retaliation; since, inasmuch as they gave Christ gall for his meat, and vinegar for his drink, it was but right that the same measure should be meted out to them again; and their table mercies and blessings be cursed; that they should have them not in love, but in bitter wrath. Or that they should be left to be overcharged with them, and surfeit upon them; and so the day of their destruction come upon them as a snare: or that they should want the common necessaries of life, and be tempted to eat what was not lawful; and even their own children, as some did; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-2.htm">Malachi 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>. The Targum gives the sense of the words thus; <p>"let their table, which they prepared before me, that I might eat before them, be for a snare;'' <p>meaning a table spread with vinegar and gall. Of the figurative sense of these words; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9</a>; where apostle cites this passage, and applies it to the enemies of Christ; <p>and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap; the word translated, "for their welfare", comes from  which signifies both "to be at peace", and "to recompense"; and so is differently interpreted. Some think the "shelamim", or peace offerings, are meant; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>; and so the Targum, <p>"let their sacrifices be for a trap, or stumbling block;'' <p>as they were, they trusting in them for the atonement of sin: and so neglected the atoning sacrifice of Christ, and his righteousness; which was the stumbling block at which they stumbled, and the trap into which they fell, and was their ruin. And it is observable, that while they were eating the sacrifice of the passover, they were surrounded by the Roman army, and taken as birds in a net, and as beasts in a trap. Others render the words, "to them that are at peace" (i), let their table be "for a trap"; while they are living in security, and crying, Peace, peace, let sudden, destruction come upon them; as it did. But the apostle has taught us how to render the word "for a recompence", <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9</a>; as the word, differently pointed, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>. The true rendering and meaning of the whole seem to be this, "let their table become a snare before them"; and let their table be "for recompences" unto them, or in just retaliation; let the same food, or the like unto it, be set upon their tables, they gave to Christ, and let their table "become a trap"; for all relate to their table. <p>(h) "erit", Pagninus, Montanus; "fiet vel fiat", Gejerus.

They had aggravated the sufferings of a joyless life: let their own enjoyments turn to their ruin. The idea of the transformation of their table into a snare becomes more intelligible if it is remembered that the table meant was probably a piece of leather unrolled and spread upon the ground, such as is still used in the East. The curse is intensified by the prayer that this fate may overtake them while they are in unsuspecting security.

At the thought of the intolerable inhumanity of his enemies he can no longer restrain himself, and breaks out into fierce imprecation.

We may view them either as an outpouring of righteous indignation upon the enemies, not of David only, but of God; or as a series of prophetic denunciations, whereby the wicked of David's time were warned of the consequences of such wickedness as theirs, and stimulated to repentance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let their table become a snare</span>  <span class="cmt_word">before them.</span> It is not very clear how their table was to ensnare them: perhaps by encouraging them to gluttony and sensuousness, and bringing upon them the diseases which those sins breed; perhaps by leading them to an ostentatious display of wealth and luxury (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40, 41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</span> Let them be trapped by the good things of their table, like a wild beast by a bait. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/69.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this second part the petition by which the first is as it were encircled, is continued; the peril grows greater the longer it lasts, and with it the importunity of the cry for help.

But since neither the Athnach-word nor the Silluk-word has two syllables preceding the tone syllable, the accents are transformed according to Accentuationssystem, xviii. 2, 4.)<p>The accumulation of synonyms in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-20.htm">Psalm 69:20</a> is Jeremiah's custom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-14.htm">Jeremiah 13:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>, and is found also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>) and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-17.htm">Psalm 44:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a>).

The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;, &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (historical tense), from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, is explained by &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; from &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;, sickly, dangerously ill, evil-disposed, which is a favourite word in Jeremiah. Moreover &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification of manifesting pity, not found elsewhere in the Psalter, is common in Jeremiah, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; it signifies originally to nod to any one as a sign of a pity that sympathizes with him and recognises the magnitude of the evil. "To give wormwood for meat and &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; to drink" is a Jeremianic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>) designation for inflicting the extreme of pain and anguish upon one. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;) signifies first of all a poisonous plant with an umbellated head of flower or a capitate fruit; but then, since bitter and poisonous are interchangeable notions in the Semitic languages, it signifies gall as the bitterest of the bitter. The lxx renders: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Certainly &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468; can mean to put something into something, to mix something with it, but the parallel word &#1500;&#1510;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497; (for my thirst, i.e., for the quenching of it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-15.htm">Nehemiah 9:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>) favours the supposition that the &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; is Beth essentiae, after which Luther renders: "they give me gall to eat."
