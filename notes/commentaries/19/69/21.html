These words were only metaphorically fulfilled in David, but were properly and literally accomplished in Christ; the description of whose sufferings, it seems, was principally intended here by the Holy Ghost, who therefore directed David’s pen to these words. And hence what follows may as truly, and perhaps more properly, be considered as predictions of the punishment which should be inflicted on the persecutors of our Lord, than as imprecations of David against his enemies. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>69:13-21 Whatever deep waters of affliction or temptation we sink into, whatever floods of trouble or ungodly men seem ready to overwhelm us, let us persevere in prayer to our Lord to save us. The tokens of God's favour to us are enough to keep our spirits from sinking in the deepest outward troubles. If we think well of God, and continue to do so under the greatest hardships, we need not fear but he will do well for us. And if at any time we are called on to suffer reproach and shame, for Christ's sake, this may be our comfort, that he knows it. It bears hard on one that knows the worth of a good name, to be oppressed with a bad one; but when we consider what a favour it is to be accounted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus, we shall see that there is no reason why it should be heart-breaking to us. The sufferings of Christ were here particularly foretold, which proves the Scripture to be the word of God; and how exactly these predictions were fulfilled in Jesus Christ, which proves him to be the true Messiah. The vinegar and the gall given to him, were a faint emblem of that bitter cup which he drank up, that we might drink the cup of salvation. We cannot expect too little from men, miserable comforters are they all; nor can we expect too much from the God of all comfort and consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They gave me also - My enemies; all persons around me. No one would show me even so much kindness as to give me food when I was hungry, or drink when I was thirsty. They utterly forsook me; they left me to die unpitied. Nay, they did more than this. When I was perishing with hunger, they not only refused to give me wholesome food, but they mocked my sufferings by giving me a bitter and poisonous herb for food, and vinegar for my drink.<p>Gall for my meat - For my food. Or, they gave me this "instead" of wholesome food. The word here rendered "gall" - &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  ro&#770;'sh - is the same "in form" which is commonly rendered "head," and occurs in this sense very often in the Scriptures. It is also used to denote a "poisonous plant," perhaps from the idea that the plant referred to was distinguished for, or remarkable for its "head" - as the poppy; and "then" the name may have been given also to some other similar plants. The word then comes to denote poison; venom; anything poisonous; and then, anything very bad-tasted; "bitter." It is rendered "gall," as here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-5.htm">Lamentations 3:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>; "venom" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a>; "poison," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-16.htm">Job 20:16</a>; and "hemlock," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>, it is rendered, in the margin, "rosh," or "a poisonful herb." It does not occur elsewhere with any such signification. It may not be possible to determine precisely what is denoted here by the word, but it undoubtedly refers to some poisonous, bitter, deadly, stupefying substance given to a sufferer, "instead" of that which would be wholesome food, or suited to sustain life.<p>And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink - Instead of giving me pure water, they gave me sour wine - vinegar - that which would not slake my thirst, or which would not answer the purpose of drink. The form of trial here referred to is that where one is dying of thirst, and where, instead of giving water to assuage the thirst, one should give, in mockery, that which could not be drunk, or which would answer none of the purposes required. The word translated "vinegar" - &#1495;&#1502;&#1509;  cho&#770;mets - is rendered in the ancient versions "sour grapes," but the proper signification here seems to be vinegar - the usual meaning of the word. What is here stated to have been done to David was also done to the dying Saviour, though without any intimation that the passage here had an original reference to him - or that what was done to him was intended to be a fulfillment of what is here said. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-48.htm">Matthew 27:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm">Mark 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>. In the case of the Saviour, they first gave him vinegar mingled with myrrh - a usual custom in reference to those who were crucified - for the purpose of deadening the pain, or stupefying the sufferer. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>. At a subsequent part of the crucifixion they gave him vinegar, extended to him in a sponge affixed to a reed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-48.htm">Matthew 27:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a>. This was for a different purpose. It was to allay his thirst, and it seems (as the former may have been) to have been an act of kindness or compassion on the part of those who were appointed to crucify him. The former he refused to take, because he came to suffer; the latter he just tasted as he died. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>. The "coincidence" in the cases of David and the Saviour was remarkable; but in the case of the Saviour no further use is made of what occurred to David than to employ the "language" which he employed to describe his own sufferings. The one was not, in any proper sense, a "type" of the other; nor does the language in the psalm refer to the Saviour. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/69.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Instead of such, his enemies increase his pain by giving him most distasteful food and drink. The Psalmist may have thus described by figure what Christ found in reality (compare Joh 19:29, 30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Gall, </span> or <span class="ital">poison</span>, or <span class="ital">bitter herbs</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm" title="They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.">Hosea 10:4</a></span>.

Instead of giving me that pity and comfort which my condition required, they barbarously added to my afflictions. These things were metaphorically fulfilled in David, but properly and literally h Christ, the description of whose sufferings was principally intended here by the Holy Ghost, who therefore directed David’s pen to these words, and possibly informed him that this should be accomplished in Christ; which may not seem improbable to him that considers the following imprecations, which are so many and so severe, that they may seem to exceed the bounds of justice and charity, if they be applied to David’s enemies, as a recompence for their injuries done to him; whereas they most deservedly and fitly belong to the enemies and murderers of Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/69.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They gave me also gall for my meat,.... Either some bitter herb mentioned with wormwood and hemlock, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>; or the gall of some animal The Targum renders it, <p>"the gall of the heads of serpents:'' <p>the poison of some serpents is in their heads, and the word that is here used signifies the head; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a>. This was literally fulfilled in Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>; and showed that he bore the curse of the law; that being given to him for food, which was not fit to be eaten; thereby intimating, that he deserved not to have the common food and necessaries of life; which is the case of those in whose place and stead he suffered: and this may be a rebuke to such who, through fulness and affluence, are apt to slight and contemn some of the good creatures of God, which ought to be received with thanksgiving; let them remember the gall that was given Christ for meat. And this may serve to reconcile poor Christians to that mean fare and low way of living they are obliged to; though they, have but a dinner of herbs, or bread and water, it is better fare than their Lord's; it is not gall; <p>and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink; Christ, when on the cross, was athirst, which was occasioned by a fever that usually attended persons in his circumstances; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>; and, that this Scripture might be fulfilled, he signified it, saying, "I thirst"; upon which vinegar was given to him, as all the evangelists relate; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-48.htm">Matthew 27:48</a>. This shows the truth of Christ's human nature; that it was a true and real body that he assumed, which was subject to hunger and thirst, and was supported by food and drink, as our bodies are; also the truth of divine revelation; since such a minute circumstance as this, predicted so many hundred years ago, should, after so long a time, be exactly fulfilled; and likewise the truth of the Messiahship of Jesus, in whom this, and every thing else said Messiah, in the Law, the Prophets, and the book of Psalms, were fully accomplished; and therefore it may be strongly concluded that this is he of whom they spoke. Moreover, this expresses the inhumanity of the enemies of Christ, to use him in this manner, when he was suffering and dying; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/69.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/69.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. This verse is connected with the preceding one. Not content with merely refusing sympathy, they aggravated and embittered his sufferings, as though one were to mock a hungry man by offering him bitter and poisonous food, or a thirsty man by giving him sour and undrinkable wine.

The lxx renders: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Certainly &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468; can mean to put something into something, to mix something with it, but the parallel word &#1500;&#1510;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497; (for my thirst, i.e., for the quenching of it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-15.htm">Nehemiah 9:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>) favours the supposition that the &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; is Beth essentiae, after which Luther renders: "they give me gall to eat." The &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;) signifies &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (root &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;, Sanscrit gar, Latin vor-are). </body></html>
