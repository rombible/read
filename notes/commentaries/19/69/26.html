Verses 22,23, are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelieving Jews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel of sin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; their punishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up to their own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God's great salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignation will be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon for it. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, through the righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from that righteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shut themselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that they will not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doom accordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect any benefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better to be poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich and jovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was, when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; but God exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor and sorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten - That is, instead of pitying one who is afflicted of God, or showing compassion for him, they "add" to his sorrows by their own persecutions. The psalmist was suffering as under the hand of God. He needed sympathy from others in his trials. Instead of that, however, he found only reproaches, opposition, persecution, calumny. There was an entire want of sympathy and kindness. There was a disposition to take advantage of the fact that he was suffering at the hand of God, to increase his sorrows in all ways in which they could do it.<p>And they talk to the grief of those - What they say adds to their sorrow. They speak of the character of those who are afflicted; they allege that the affliction is the punishment of some crime which they have committed; they take advantage of any expressions of impatience which they may let fall in their affliction to charge them with being of a rebellious spirit, or regard it as proof that they are destitute of all true piety. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/41-5.htm">Psalm 41:5-8</a>. It was this which added so much to the affliction of Job. His professed friends, instead of sympathizing with him, endeavored to prove that the fact that he suffered so much at the hand of God demonstrated that he was a hypocrite; and the expressions of impatience which he uttered in his trial, instead of leading them to sympathize with him, only tended to confirm them in this belief.<p>Whom thou hast wounded - literally, as in the margin, "thy wounded." That is, of those whom "thou" hast afflicted. The reference is to the psalmist himself as afflicted by God, while, at the same time, he makes the remark general by saying that this was their character; this was what they were accustomed to do. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/69.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

The combination "from those who hate me and from the depths of the waters" shows that "the depths of the waters" is not a merely rhetorical figure; and the form of the prayer: let not the pit (the well-pit or covered tank) close (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512; with Dagesh in the Teth, in order to guard against its being read &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1496;&#1512;; cf. on the signification of &#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, clausus  equals  claudus, scil. manu) its mouth (i.e., its upper opening) upon me, exceeds the limits of anything that can be allowed to mere rhetoric.

The "answer me" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-17.htm">Psalm 69:17</a> is based upon the plea that God's loving-kindness is &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, i.e., good, absolutely good (as in the kindred passion-Psalm, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-21.htm">Psalm 109:21</a>), better than all besides (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>), the means of healing or salvation from all evil.

Moreover &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification of manifesting pity, not found elsewhere in the Psalter, is common in Jeremiah, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; it signifies originally to nod to any one as a sign of a pity that sympathizes with him and recognises the magnitude of the evil. "To give wormwood for meat and &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; to drink" is a Jeremianic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>) designation for inflicting the extreme of pain and anguish upon one. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;) signifies first of all a poisonous plant with an umbellated head of flower or a capitate fruit; but then, since bitter and poisonous are interchangeable notions in the Semitic languages, it signifies gall as the bitterest of the bitter.
