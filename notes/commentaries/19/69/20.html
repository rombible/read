The tokens of God's favour to us are enough to keep our spirits from sinking in the deepest outward troubles. If we think well of God, and continue to do so under the greatest hardships, we need not fear but he will do well for us. And if at any time we are called on to suffer reproach and shame, for Christ's sake, this may be our comfort, that he knows it. It bears hard on one that knows the worth of a good name, to be oppressed with a bad one; but when we consider what a favour it is to be accounted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus, we shall see that there is no reason why it should be heart-breaking to us. The sufferings of Christ were here particularly foretold, which proves the Scripture to be the word of God; and how exactly these predictions were fulfilled in Jesus Christ, which proves him to be the true Messiah. The vinegar and the gall given to him, were a faint emblem of that bitter cup which he drank up, that we might drink the cup of salvation. We cannot expect too little from men, miserable comforters are they all; nor can we expect too much from the God of all comfort and consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Reproach hath broken my heart - The reproaches, the calumnies, the aspersions, the slanders of others, have crushed me. I am not able to bear up under them; I fail under the burden. Distress may become so great that life may sink under it, for many die of what is called "a broken heart." Undeserved reproaches will be as likely to produce this result on a sensitive heart as any form of suffering; and there are thousands who are crushed to the earth by such reproaches.<p>And I am full of heaviness - Or, I am sick; I am weak; I am ill at ease. My strength is gone.<p>And I looked for some to take pity - Margin, "to lament with me." The meaning of the Hebrew word is to pity; to commiserate; to show compassion. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-19.htm">Isaiah 51:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a>.<p>But there was none - There was no one whose heart seemed to be touched with compassion in the case; none who sympathized with me.<p>And for comforters - For those who would show sympathy for me; who would evince a friendly feeling in my distress.<p>But I found none - He felt that he was utterly forsaken by mankind.

The figure of sinking in the mire or mud and in the depths of the pit (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-24.htm">Psalm 55:24</a>, cf. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-3.htm">Psalm 40:3</a>) is again taken up, and so studiously wrought out, that the impression forces itself upon one that the poet is here describing something that has really taken place. The combination "from those who hate me and from the depths of the waters" shows that "the depths of the waters" is not a merely rhetorical figure; and the form of the prayer: let not the pit (the well-pit or covered tank) close (&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512; with Dagesh in the Teth, in order to guard against its being read &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1496;&#1512;; cf. on the signification of &#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, clausus  equals  claudus, scil. manu) its mouth (i.e., its upper opening) upon me, exceeds the limits of anything that can be allowed to mere rhetoric. "Let not the water-flood overflow me" is intended to say, since it has, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>, already happened, let it not go further to my entire destruction. The "answer me" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-17.htm">Psalm 69:17</a> is based upon the plea that God's loving-kindness is &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, i.e., good, absolutely good (as in the kindred passion-Psalm, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-21.htm">Psalm 109:21</a>), better than all besides (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>), the means of healing or salvation from all evil.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-18.htm">Psalm 69:18</a> the prayer is based upon the painful situation of the poet, which urgently calls for speedy help (&#1502;&#1492;&#1512; beside the imperative, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-3.htm">Psalm 102:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-7.htm">Psalm 143:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-10.htm">Esther 6:10</a>, is certainly itself not an imperative like &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, but an adverbial infinitive as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>). &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, or, in order to ensure the pronunciation k&#803;orbah in distinction from k&#803;a&#772;rbah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>, &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; (in Baer,<p>(Note: Originally - was the sign for every kind of o6, hence the Masora includes the &#1495;&#1496;&#1493;&#1507; also under the name &#1511;&#1502;&#1509; &#1495;&#1496;&#1507;; vid., Luther.

Moreover &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; in the signification of manifesting pity, not found elsewhere in the Psalter, is common in Jeremiah, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>; it signifies originally to nod to any one as a sign of a pity that sympathizes with him and recognises the magnitude of the evil. "To give wormwood for meat and &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; to drink" is a Jeremianic (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm">Jeremiah 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>) designation for inflicting the extreme of pain and anguish upon one. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;) signifies first of all a poisonous plant with an umbellated head of flower or a capitate fruit; but then, since bitter and poisonous are interchangeable notions in the Semitic languages, it signifies gall as the bitterest of the bitter. The lxx renders: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Certainly &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468; can mean to put something into something, to mix something with it, but the parallel word &#1500;&#1510;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497; (for my thirst, i.e., for the quenching of it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-15.htm">Nehemiah 9:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>) favours the supposition that the &#1489;&#1468; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; is Beth essentiae, after which Luther renders: "they give me gall to eat."
