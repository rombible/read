Dr. Delaney, who considers the distress which David was now in as being occasioned by his fall, observes, “There were two circumstances of it which, though they are beyond all question the greatest and severest which human nature, can suffer, are not sufficiently considered. The first is, the distress he endured on account of the obloquy and reproach brought upon the true religion and the truly religious by his guilt; and the second, the reproach and endless insults brought upon himself, even by his repentance and humiliation before God and the world. Let any ingenuous man, who feels for virtue and is not seared to shame, put the question to himself: I appeal to his own heart, whether he would not infinitely rather die than endure the state now described one day; forsaken by his friends, scorned by his enemies, insulted by his inferiors, the scoff of libertines, and the song of sots? What then must we think of the fortitude and magnanimity of that man who could endure all this for a series of years? Or rather, how shall we adore that unfailing mercy and all- sufficient goodness which could support him thus, under the quickest sense of shame and infamy, and deepest compunctions of conscience; which could enable him to bear up steadily against guilt, infamy, and the evil world united; from a principle of true religion! and, in the end, even rejoice in his sad estate; as he plainly perceived it must finally tend to promote the true interest of virtue, and the glory of God; that is, must finally tend to promote that interest, which was the great governing principle and main purpose of his life.” — <span class="ital">Life of David, </span>b. 3. vol. 3. pp. 30-33.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>69:13-21 Whatever deep waters of affliction or temptation we sink into, whatever floods of trouble or ungodly men seem ready to overwhelm us, let us persevere in prayer to our Lord to save us. The tokens of God's favour to us are enough to keep our spirits from sinking in the deepest outward troubles. If we think well of God, and continue to do so under the greatest hardships, we need not fear but he will do well for us. And if at any time we are called on to suffer reproach and shame, for Christ's sake, this may be our comfort, that he knows it. It bears hard on one that knows the worth of a good name, to be oppressed with a bad one; but when we consider what a favour it is to be accounted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus, we shall see that there is no reason why it should be heart-breaking to us. The sufferings of Christ were here particularly foretold, which proves the Scripture to be the word of God; and how exactly these predictions were fulfilled in Jesus Christ, which proves him to be the true Messiah. The vinegar and the gall given to him, were a faint emblem of that bitter cup which he drank up, that we might drink the cup of salvation. We cannot expect too little from men, miserable comforters are they all; nor can we expect too much from the God of all comfort and consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast known my reproach - The reproach that has come upon me; the shame and contempt which I am called to endure.

It is no novelty or secret, it has been long continued: thou, O God, hast seen it; and for thee to see the innocent suffer is an assurance of help. Here are three words piled up to express the Redeemer's keen sense of the contempt poured upon him; and his assurance that every form of malicious despite was observed of the Lord. "Mine adversaries are all before thee." The whole lewd and loud company is now present to thine eye: Judas and his treachery; Herod and his cunning; Caiaphas and his counsel; Pilate and his vacillation; Jews, priests, people, rulers, all, thou seest and wilt judge.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-20.htm">Psalm 69:20</a><p>"Reproach hath broken my heart:" There is no hammer like it. Our Lord died of a broken heart, and reproach had done the deed. Intense mental suffering arises from slander; and, in the cage of the sensitive nature of the immaculate Son of Man, it sufficed to lacerate the heart till it broke. "Then burst his mighty heart." "And I am full of heaviness." Calumny and insult bowed him to the dust; he was sick at heart. The heaviness of our Lord in the garden is expressed by many and forcible words in the four gospels, and each term goes to show that the agony was beyond measure great; he was filled with misery, like a vessel which is full to the brim. "And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none." "Deserted in his utmost need by those his former bounty fed." Not one to say him a kindly word, or drop a sympathetic tear. Amongst ten thousand foes there was not one who was touched by the spectacle of his misery; not one with a heart capable of humane feeling towards him. "And for comforters, but I found none." His dearest ones had sought their own safety, and left their Lord alone. A sick man needs comforters, and a persecuted man needs sympathy; but our blessed Surety found neither on that dark and doleful night when the powers of darkness had their hour. A spirit like that of our Lord feels acutely desertion by beloved and trusted friends, and yearns for real sympathy. This may be seen in the story of Gethsemane: - <p>"Backwards and forwards thrice he ran,<p>As if he sought some help from man;<p>Or wish'd, at least, they would condole - <p>'Twas all they could - his tortur'd soul.<p>Whate'er he sought for, there was none;<p>Our Captain fought the field alone.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/69.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast known my reproach, </span>& c.; thou seest how much of it I suffer, and that for thy sake; as he said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-7.htm" title="Because for your sake I have borne reproach; shame has covered my face.">Psalm 69:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Are all before thee; </span> thou knowest them thoroughly, and all their injurious and wicked devices and implacable malice against me, and all their impiety and contempt of thee; for which they deserve to be utterly and speedily destroyed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/69.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour,....

The waters are said to rush in unto the soul (&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;), when they so press upon the imperilled one that the soul, i.e., the life of the body, more especially the breath, is threatened; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-6.htm">Jonah 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>.

The soft, yielding morass is called &#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, and the eddying deep &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;.

The complaining one is nearly drowned in consequence of his sinking down, for he has long cried in vain for help: he is wearied by continual crying (&#1497;&#1490;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/6-7.htm">Psalm 6:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-3.htm">Jeremiah 45:3</a>), his throat is parched (&#1504;&#1495;&#1512; from &#1495;&#1512;&#1512;; lxx and Jerome: it is become hoarse), his eyes have failed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-6.htm">Jeremiah 14:6</a>) him, who waits upon his God.

Distinct from this use of the participle without the article is the adverbially qualifying participle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; Sol 5:2, cf. &#1495;&#1497;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-21.htm">2 Samuel 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>.

Apart from the words "more than the hairs of my head" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>), the complaint of the multitude of groundless enemies is just the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-3.htm">Psalm 109:3</a>, both in substance and expression. Instead of &#1502;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, my destroyers, the Syriac version has the reading &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (more numerous than my bones), which is approved by Hupfeld; but to reckon the multitude of the enemy by the number of one's own bones is both devoid of taste and unheard of. Moreover the reading of our text finds support, if it need any, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>. The words, "what I have not taken away, I must then restore," are intended by way of example, and perhaps, as also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, as a proverbial expression: that which I have not done wrong, I must suffer for (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, and the similar complaint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a>). One is tempted to take &#1488;&#1494; in the sense of "nevertheless" (Ewald), a meaning, however, which it is by no means intended to convey. In this passage it takes the place of &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; for &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>), inasmuch as it gives prominence to the restitution desired, as an inference from a false assumption: then, although I took it not away, stole it not.<p>The transition from the bewailing of suffering to a confession of sin is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-13.htm">Psalm 40:13</a>. In the undeserved persecution which he endures at the hand of man, he is obliged nevertheless to recognise well-merited chastisement from the side of God. And whilst by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-16.htm">Jeremiah 17:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>, and on &#1500; as an exponent of the object, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2</a>) he does not acknowledge himself to be a sinner after the standard of his own shortsightedness, but of the divine omniscience, he at the same time commends his sinful need, which with self-accusing modesty he calls &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a>) and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;    (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-10.htm">2 Chronicles 28:10</a>), to the mercy of the omniscient One. Should he, the sinner, be abandoned by God to destruction, then all those who are faithful in their intentions towards the Lord would be brought to shame and confusion in him, inasmuch as they would be taunted with this example. &#1511;&#1493;&#1497;&#1498; designates the godly from the side of the &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1498;a from the side of the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;. The multiplied names of God are so many appeals to God's honour, to the truthfulness of His covenant relationship. The person praying here is, it is true, a sinner, but that is no justification of the conduct of men towards him; he is suffering for the Lord's sake, and it is the Lord Himself who is reviled in him. It is upon this he bases his prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, for thy sake, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>.

Among all these possible renderings, the last is the least probable, and the first, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/83-19.htm">Psalm 83:19</a>, by far the most probable, and also that which is assumed by the accentuation.<p>(Note: The Munach of &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1501; is a transformation of Dech (just as the Munach of &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; is a transformation of Mugrash), in connection with which &#1504;&#1511;&#1513;&#1497; might certainly be conceived of even as object (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>); but this after &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (not &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;), and as being without example, could hardly have entered the minds of the punctuists.)<p>The reading of the lxx &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1; (Olshausen, Hupfeld, and Bttcher), is a very natural (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>) exchange of the poetically bold expression for one less choice and less expressive (since &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is a phrase of the Pentateuch equivalent to &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The garb of mourning, like the fasting, is an expression of sorrow for public distresses, not, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>, of personal condolence; concerning &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>. On account of this mourning, reproach after reproach comes upon him, and they fling gibes and raillery at him; everywhere, both in the gate, the place where the judges sit and where business is transacted, and also at carousals, he is jeered at and traduced (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-14.htm">Lamentations 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; signifies in itself fabulari de... without any bad secondary meaning (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>, confabulabitur tecum); here it is construed first with a personal and then a neuter subject (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>), for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a> neither &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-14.htm">Lamentations 3:14</a>) nor &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-63.htm">Lamentations 3:63</a>) is to be supplied. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> tells us how he acts in the face of such hatred and scorn; &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, sarcasmis hostium suam opponit in precibus constantiam (Geier). As for himself, his prayer is directed towards Jahve at the present time, when his affliction as a witness for God gives him the assurance that He will be well-pleased to accept it (&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1489;&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>). It is addressed to Him who is at the same time Jahve and Elohim, - the revealed One in connection with the history of redemption, and the absolute One in His exaltation above the world, - on the ground of the greatness and fulness of His mercy: may He then answer him with or in the truth of His salvation, i.e., the infallibility with which His purpose of mercy verifies itself in accordance with the promises given. Thus is <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> to be explained in accordance with the accentuation. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, it looks as though &#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; must be drawn to &#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; (Hitzig), but <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> sets us right on this point; and the fact that &#1489;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1498; is joined to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> also finds support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>. But the repetition of the divine name perplexes one, and it may be asked whether or not the accent that divides the verse into its two parts might not more properly stand beside &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> beside &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;; so that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm">Psalm 69:14</a> runs: Elohim, by virtue of the greatness of Thy mercy hear me, by virtue of the truth of Thy salvation. </body></html>
