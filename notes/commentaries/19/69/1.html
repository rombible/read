Hence we learn, when in affliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may not be soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hated wrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a world where unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meet with those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. By the satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, he restored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered for our offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjust accusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserve all that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from our foolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of the unkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ, whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by his disciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off the honours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal for the truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, and cause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/69.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Save me, O God - That is, Interpose and deliver me from the dangers which have come upon me.<p>For the waters are come in unto my soul - So as to endanger my life.

Upon Shoshannim&#8212;(See on [605]Ps 45:1, title). Mingling the language of prayer and complaint, the sufferer, whose condition is here set forth, pleads for God's help as one suffering in His cause, implores the divine retribution on his malicious enemies, and, viewing his deliverance as sure, promises praise by himself, and others, to whom God will extend like blessings. This Psalm is referred to seven times in the New Testament as prophetical of Christ and the gospel times. Although the character in which the Psalmist appears to some in Ps 69:5 is that of a sinner, yet his condition as a sufferer innocent of alleged crimes sustains the typical character of the composition, and it may be therefore regarded throughout, as the twenty-second, as typically expressive of the feelings of our Saviour in the flesh.<p>1, 2. (Compare Ps 40:2).<p>come in unto my soul&#8212;literally, "come even to my soul," endanger my life by drowning (Jon 2:5).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/69.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.<p>2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into deep waters, Where the floods overflow me.<p>3 I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.<p>4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1</a><p>"Save me, O God." "He saved others, himself he cannot save." With strong cryings and tears he offered up prayers and supplications unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>). Thus David had prayed, and here his Son and Lord utters the same cry. This is the second Psalm which begins with a "Save me, O God," and the former (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1-7</a>) is but a short summary of this more lengthened complaint. It is remarkable that such a scene of woe should be presented to us immediately after the jubilant ascension hymn of the last Psalm, but this only shows how interwoven are the glories and the sorrows of our ever-blessed Redeemer. The head which now is crowned with glory is the same which wore the thorns; he to whom we pray, "Save us, O God," is the selfsame person who cried, "Save me, O God." "For the waters are come in unto my soul." Sorrows, deep, abounding, deadly, had penetrated his inner nature. Bodily anguish is not his first complaint; he begins not with the gall which embittered his lips, but with the mighty griefs which broke into his heart. All the sea outside a vessel is less to be feared than that which finds its way into the hold. A wounded spirit who can bear. Our Lord in this verse is seen before us as a Jonah, crying, "The waters compassed me about, even to the soul." He was doing business for us on the great waters, at his Father's command; the stormy wind was lifting up the waves thereof, and he went down to the depths till his soul was melted because of trouble. In all this he has sympathy with us, and is able to succour us when we, like Peter, beginning to sink, cry to him, "Lord, save, or we perish."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a><p>"I sink in deep mire." In water one might swim, but in mud and mire all struggling is hopeless; the mire sucks down its victim. "Where there is no standing." Everything gave way under the Sufferer; he could not get foothold for support - this is a worse fate than drowning. Here our Lord pictures the close, clinging nature of his heart's woes. "He began to be sorrowful, and very heavy." Sin is as mire for its filthiness, and the holy soul of the Saviour must have loathed even that connection with it which was necessary for its expiation. His pure and sensitive nature seemed to sink in it, for it was not his element, he was not like us born and acclimatised to this great dismal swamp. Here our Redeemer became another Jeremiah, of whom it is recorded (Jer.' <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>) that his enemies cast him into a dungeon wherein "was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire." Let our hearts feel the emotions, both of contrition and gratitude, as we see in this simile the deep humiliation of our Lord. "I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me." The sorrow gathers even greater force; he is as one cast into the sea, the waters cover his head. His sorrows were first within, then around, and now above him. Our lord was no faint-hearted sentimentalist; his were real woes, and though he bore them heroically, yet were they terrible even to him. His sufferings were unlike all others in degree, the waters were such as soaked into the soul; the mire was the mire of the abyss itself, and the floods Were deep and overflowing. To us the promise is, "the rivers shall not overflow thee," but no such word of consolation was vouchsafed to him. My soul, thy Well-beloved endured all this for thee many waters could not quench his love, neither could the floods drown it; and, because of this, thou hast the rich benefit of that covenant assurance, "as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee." He stemmed the torrent of almighty wrath, that we might for ever rest in Jehovah's love.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a><p>"I am weary of my crying." Not of it, but by it, with it. He had prayed till he sweat great drops of blood, and well might physical weariness intervene. "My throat is dried," parched, and inflamed. Long pleading with awful fervour had scorched his throat as with flames of fire. Few, very few, of his saints follow their Lord in prayer as far as this. We are, it is to be feared, more likely to be hoarse with talking frivolities to men than by pleading with God; yet our sinful nature demands more prayer than his perfect humanity might seem to need. His prayers should shame us into fervour. Our Lord's supplications were salted with fire, they were hot with agony; and hence they weakened his system, and made him "a weary man and full of woes." "Mine eyes Jail While I wait for my God." He wanted in his direst distress nothing more than his God; that would be all in all to him. Many 9f us know what watching and waiting mean; and we know something of the failing eye when hope is long deferred: but in all this Jesus bears the palm; no eyes ever failed as his did or for so deep a cause. No painter can ever depict those eyes; their pencils fail in every feature of his all fair but: all marred countenance, but most of all do they come short when they venture to pourtray those eyes which were fountains of tears. He knew how both to pray and to watch, and he would have us learn the like. There are times when we should pray till the throat is dry, and watch till the eyes grow dim. Only thus can we have fellowship with him in his sufferings. What! can we not watch with him one hour? Does the flesh shrink back? O cruel flesh to be so tender of thyself, and so ungenerous to thy Lord!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a><p>"They that hate me." Surprising sin that men should hate the altogether lovely one, truly is it added, "without a cause," for reason there was none for this senseless enmity. He neither blasphemed God, nor injured man. As Samuel said: "Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed?" Even so might Jesus enquire. Besides, he had not only done us no evil, but he had bestowed countless and priceless benefits. Well might he demand, "For which of these works do ye stone me?" Yet from his cradle to his cross, beginning with Herod and not ending with Judas, he had foes without number; and he justly said, they "are more than the hairs of mine head." was the unanimous resolve of all the keepers of the Jewish vineyard; while the Gentiles outside the walls of the garden furnished the instruments for his murder, and actually did the deed. The hosts of earth and hell, banded together, made up vast legions of antagonists, none of whom had any just ground for hating him. They that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty." It was bad that they were many, but worse that they were mighty. All the ecclesiastical and military powers of his country were arrayed against him. The might of the Sanhedrim, the mob, and the Roman legions were combined in one for his utter destruction, "Away with such a fellow from this earth; it is not fit that he should live," was the shout of his ferocious foes. David's adversaries were on the throne when he was hiding in caverns, and our Lord's enemies were the great ones of the earth; while he, of whom the world was not worthy, was reproached of men and despised of the people. "Then I restored that which I took not away." Though innocent, he was treated guilty. Though David had no share in plots against Saul, yet he was held accountable for them. In reference to our Lord, it may be truly said that he restores what he took not away; for he gives back to the injured honour of God a recompense, and to man his lost happiness, though the insult of the one and the fall of the other were neither of them, in any sense, his doings. Usually, when the ruler sins the people suffer, but here the proverb is reversed - the sheep go astray, and their wanderings are laid at the Shepherd's door. <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm of David consists of his complaints and fervent prayers, and comfortable predictions of his deliverance, and of the ruin of his enemies. But the condition of this Psalm is like that of divers others, wherein although the matter or substance of it agree in some sort to David, yet there are some singular passages, which he delivers with a particular respect unto Christ, of whom he was an eminent type, and upon whom his thoughts were much and often fixed, and of whom they are more fitly and fully understood; and therefore they are justly applied to him in the New Testament, as we shall see. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>David (as a type of Christ) complaineth of his heavy and manifold afflictions, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/69-1.htm" title="Save me, O God; for the waters are come in to my soul....">Psalm 69:1-12</a></span>; fervently prayeth for help and deliverance, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/69-13.htm" title="But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of your mercy hear me, in the truth of your salvation....">Psalm 69:13-21</a></span>; giveth over his enemies to, destruction, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/69-22.htm" title="Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap....">Psalm 69:22-29</a></span>; and praiseth God in confidence of being accepted, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/69-30.htm" title="I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving....">Psalm 69:30-34</a></span>, and Zion saved, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-35.htm" title="For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.">Psalm 69:35</a>,36</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">Waters, </span> i.e. tribulations, which are oft expressed by <span class="ital">waters</span>; as hath been observed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto my soul, </span> i.e. to my vital parts; so that I am ready to be choked with them.

The petitioner is Christ; not as a divine Person, as such he is blessed for ever, and stands in no need of help and assistance; but as man, and in distressed and suffering circumstances. As a priest, it was part of his work to intercede, as well as to offer sacrifice; and though he did not offer a sin offering for himself, yet he offered up supplications, with strong cryings and tears; and, as the surety of his people, he prayed, in point of right and justice, both for himself and them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>. The person petitioned is God the Father, who was able to save him, and always heard him; and did in this petition, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>; which perfectly agrees with some petitions of Christ, recorded in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>. These show the weakness of the human nature, the weight of sin upon him, and his sense of the wrath of God; and which, notwithstanding, were made with limitations and restrictions, and even with a correction. Moreover, this may also design help and assistance from his divine Father, which was promised him, and he expected and had, in the acceptable time, in the day of salvation: and he was so saved in death, as that he abolished that, and destroyed him that had the power of it; and was quickly raised from the grave, and thereby saved out of it. And this he could have done himself, but he would be saved in a legal way, in a way of justice; and as a point of honour, when he had done the work, he, as a surety, engaged to do. The reasons enforcing this petition follow: <p>for the waters are come in unto my soul: the Messiah represents his case, in these words, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>, as like to that of a man standing up to his chin in water, and the waters running into his mouth, just suffocating him; and that in a miry place, where he could not set his feet firm, nor get himself out; and even overflowed with the floods, and immersed in the deep waters, and so in the most imminent danger. These overwhelming waters may signify the floods of ungodly men that encompassed him, the assembly of the wicked that enclosed him; and the proud waters that went over his soul, the Gentiles and people of Israel, that were gathered against him to destroy him; and so the Targum interprets it of the camp of sinners, that pressed him on every side, as water: the whole posse of devils may also be designed, for now was the hour and power of darkness; Satan, and his principalities and powers, came in like a flood upon him, to swallow him up; innumerable evils, the sins of his people, came upon him from every quarter, and pressed him sore; the curses of the law fell upon him, which may be compared to the bitter water of jealousy that caused the curse. These entered into him, when he was made a curse for his people; and the wrath of God went over him, and lay hard upon him, and came about him like water, into his very soul, which made him exceeding sorrowful, even unto death. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/69.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><<To the chief Musician upon <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Shoshannim, <i>A Psalm</i> of David.>> Save me, O God; for the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> waters are come in unto <i>my</i> soul.</span><p>(a) Of Shoshannim, read Ps 45:1.<p>(b) David shows by the waters the great dangers he was in, out of which God delivered him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/69.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">the waters</span> &c.] He is like a drowning man.

Out of the consciousness that He alone can preserve Israel upon this height of power upon which it is placed, who has placed it thereon, grows the prayer: establish (&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; with &#1493;&#1468; for u&#774;, as is frequently the case, and with the accent on the ultima on account of the following Aleph, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>), Elohim, that which Thou hast wrought for us; &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, roborare, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-28.htm">Proverbs 8:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>, lxx &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. It might also be interpreted: show Thyself powerful (cf. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, 21:14), Thou who (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>) hast wrought for us (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>, with &#1500;, like &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-3.htm">Isaiah 64:3</a>); but in the other way of taking it the prayer attaches itself more sequentially to what precedes, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a> shows that &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; can also represent the neuter. Hitzig has a still different rendering: the powerful divine help, which Thou hast given us; but although - instead of -&#1514; in the stat. construct. is Ephraimitish style (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>), yet &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1494; is an unknown word, and the expression "from Thy temple," which is manifestly addressed to Elohim, shows that &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; is not the language of address to the king (according to Hitzig, to Jehoshaphat).

The words together are the statement of the starting-point of the oblations belonging to &#1497;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;: starting from Thy temple, which soars aloft over Jerusalem, may kings bring Thee, who sittest enthroned there in the Holy of holies, tributary gifts (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-12.htm">Psalm 76:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>). In this connection (of prayer) it is the expression of the desire that the Temple may become the zenith or cynosure, and Jerusalem the metropolis, of the world. In this passage, where it introduces the seat of religious worship, the taking of &#1502;&#1503; as expressing the primary cause, "because or on account of Thy Temple" (Ewald), is not to be entertained.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a> follows a summons, which in this instance is only the form in which the prediction clothes itself. The "beast of the reed" is not the lion, of which sojourn among the reeds is not a characteristic (although it makes its home inter arundineta Mesopotamiae, Ammianus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>, and in the thickets of the Jordan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-3.htm">Zechariah 11:3</a>). The reed is in itself an emblem of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>), and it is therefore either the crocodile, the usual emblem of Pharaoh and of the power of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>.) that is meant, or even the hippopotamus (Egyptian p-ehe-mo&#770;ut), which also symbolizes Egypt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a> (which see), and according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21</a> is more appropriately than the crocodile (&#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>) called &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;. Egypt appears here as the greatest and most dreaded worldly power. Elohim is to check the haughty ones who exalt themselves over Israel and Israel's God. &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, strong ones, are bulls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>) as an emblem of the kings; and &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; explains itself by the genit. epexeg. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; .gexep: together with (Beth of the accompaniment as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a>, and beside the plur. humanus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-15.htm">Jeremiah 41:15</a>) the calves, viz., the peoples, over whom those bulls rule. With the one emblem of Egypt is combined the idea of defiant self-confidence, and with the other the idea of comfortable security (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-20.htm">Jeremiah 46:20</a>.). That which is brought prominently forward as the consequence of the menace is moulded in keeping with these emblems. &#1502;&#1514;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1505;, which has been explained by Flaminius substantially correctly: ut supplex veniat, is intended to be taken as a part. fut. (according to the Arabic grammar, h&#803;a&#770;l muqaddar, lit., a predisposed condition). It thus comprehensively in the singular (like &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-9.htm">Psalm 8:9</a>) with one stroke depicts thoroughly humbled pride; for &#1512;&#1508;&#1505; (cf. &#1512;&#1502;&#1505;) signifies to stamp, pound, or trample, to knock down, and the Hithpa. either to behave as a trampling one, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm">Proverbs 6:3</a>, or to trample upon one's self, i.e., to cast one's self violently upon the ground. Others explain it as conculcandum se praebere; but such a meaning cannot be shown to exist in the sphere of the Hebrew Hithpael; moreover this "suffering one's self to be trampled upon" does not so well suit the words, which require a more active sense, viz., &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507;cep, in which is expressed the idea that the riches which the Gentiles have hitherto employed in the service of God-opposed worldliness, are no offered to the God of Israel by those who both in outward circumstances and in heart are vanquished (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>; 9). &#1512;&#1509;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; (from &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, confringere) is a piece of uncoined silver, a bar, wedge, or ingot of silver. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; there is a wide leap from the call &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; to the language of description. This rapid change is also to be found in other instances, and more especially in this dithyrambic Psalm we may readily give up any idea of a change in the pointing, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512; (lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;); &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;, as it stands, cannot be imperative (Hitzig), for the final vowel essential to the imperat. Piel is wanting. God hath scattered the peoples delighting in war; war is therefore at an end, and the peace of the world is realized.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-32.htm">Psalm 68:32</a>, the contemplation of the future again takes a different turn: futures follow as the most natural expression of that which is future. The form &#1497;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, more usually found in pause, here stands pathetically at the beginning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, compared with the Arabic chs&#780;m (whence Arab. chas&#780;s&#780;m, a nose, a word erroneously denied by Gesenius), would signify the supercilious, contemptuous (cf. Arab. a&#770;s&#780;ammun, nasutus, as an appellation of a proud person who will put up with nothing). On the other hand, compared with Arab. h&#803;s&#780;m, it would mean the fat ones, inasmuch as this verbal stem (root Arab. h&#803;s&#780;s&#780;, cf. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-12.htm">2 Samuel 22:12</a>), starting from the primary signification "to be pressed together," also signifies "to be compressed, become compact," i.e., to regain one's plumpness, to make flesh and fat, applied, according to the usage of the language, to wasted men and animals. The commonly compared Arab. h&#803;s&#780;&#305;&#770;m, vir magni famulitii, is not at all natural, - a usage which is brought about by the intransitive signification proper to the verb starting from its radical signification, "to become or be angry, to be zealous about any one or anything," inasmuch as the nomen verbale Arab. ha&#803;s&#780;amun signifies in the concrete sense a person, or collectively persons, for whose maintenance, safety, and honour one is keenly solicitous, such as the members of the family, household attendants, servants, neighbours, clients or protgs, guest-friends; also a thing which one ardently seeks, and over the preservation of which one keeps zealous watch (Fleischer). Here there does not appear to be any connecting link whatever in the Arabic which might furnish some hold for the Hebrew; hence it will be more advisable, by comparison of &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1500; and &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, to understand by &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the resplendent, most distinguished ones, perillustres. The dignitaries of Egypt come to give glory to the God of Israel, and Aethiopia, disheartened by fear before Jahve (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-7.htm">Habakkuk 3:7</a>), causes his hands to run to Elohim, i.e., hastens to stretch them out. Thus it is interpreted by most expositors. But if it is &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, why is it not also &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;? We reply, the Hebrew style, even in connection with words that stand close beside one another, does not seek to avoid either the enallage generis (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-3.htm">Job 39:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-16.htm">Job 39:16</a>), or the enall. numeri (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>). But "to cause the hands to run" is a far-fetched and easily misunderstood figure. We may avoid it, if, with Bttcher and Olshausen, we disregard the accentuation and interpret thus, "Cush - his hands cause to hasten, i.e., bring on in haste (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-17.htm">1 Samuel 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>), to Elohim," viz., propitiating gifts; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509; being the predicate to &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, according to Ges. 146, 3.</body></html>
