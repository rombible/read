As, then, thou hast hitherto helped me, do not now leave me; but deliver me from these, as thou hast formerly delivered me from other powerful enemies. Thus David, in his distress, encouraged himself in God by the experience he had had of his former gracious interpositions in his favour, by saving him from his cruel enemies, who had frequently attempted his destruction, and whom he compares to savage beasts, which tear their prey with their teeth, and grind it with their jaws, an allusion which, in a country abounding with these ravenous creatures, was natural and expressive. Some, however, consider him as relating, in the former verses, the state of his mind during his flight, and as expressing, in the latter part of this, and in the following, his thankfulness for his deliverance, which he ascribes entirely to God’s power and goodness. See Chandler.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:4-8 Care and grief do us good, when they engage us to pray to God, as in earnest. David had always found God ready to answer his prayers. Nothing can fix a gulf between the communications of God's grace towards us, and the working of his grace in us; between his favour and our faith. He had always been very safe under the Divine protection. This is applicable to the common mercies of every night, for which we ought to give thanks every morning. Many lie down, and cannot sleep, through pain of body, or anguish of mind, or the continual alarms of fear in the night. But it seems here rather to be meant of the calmness of David's spirit, in the midst of his dangers. The Lord, by his grace and the consolations of his Spirit, made him easy. It is a great mercy, when we are in trouble, to have our minds stayed upon God. Behold the Son of David composing himself to his rest upon the cross, that bed of sorrows; commending his Spirit into the Father's hands in full confidence of a joyful resurrection. Behold this, O Christian: let faith teach thee how to sleep, and how to die; while it assures thee that as sleep is a short death, so death is only a longer sleep; the same God watches over thee, in thy bed and in thy grave. David's faith became triumphant. He began the psalm with complaints of the strength and malice of his enemies; but concludes with rejoicing in the power and grace of his God, and now sees more with him than against him. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; he has power to save, be the danger ever so great. All that have the Lord for their God, are sure of salvation; for he who is their God, is the God of Salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arise, O Lord - This is a common mode of calling upon God in the Scriptures, as if he had been sitting still, or had been inactive. It is, of course, language taken from human conceptions, for in the intervals of active effort, in labor or in battle, we sit or lie down, and when we engage in toil we arise from our sitting or recumbent posture. So the mind accustoms itself to think of God. The idea is simply that David now calls upon God to interpose in his behalf and to deliver him.<p>Save me, O my God - He was still surrounded by numerous enemies, and he, therefore, calls earnestly upon God to help him. In accordance with a common usage in the Scriptures, and with what is right for all the people of God, he calls him "his" God: "O my God." That is, he was the God whom he recognized as his God in distinction from all idols, and who had manifested himself as his God by the many mercies which he had conferred on him.<p>For thou hast smitten all mine enemies - That is, in former exigencies, or on former occasions. In his conflicts with Saul, with the Philistines, and with the surrounding nations, he had done this; and as the result of all he had established him on the throne, and placed him over the realm. In the remembrance of all this he appeals with the full confidence that what God had done for him before He would do now, and that, notwithstanding he was surrounded with numerous foes, He would again interpose. So we may derive comfort and assurance in present trouble or danger from the recollection of what God has done for us in former times. He who has saved us in former perils can still save us; we may believe that he who did not forsake us in those perils will not leave us now.<p>Upon the cheek-bone - This language seems to be taken from a comparison of his enemies with wild beasts; and the idea is, that God had disarmed them as one would a lion or tiger by breaking out his teeth. The cheek-bone denotes the bone in which the teeth are placed; and to smite that, is to disarm the animal. The idea here is not that of "insult," therefore; but the meaning is simply that he had deprived them of the power of doing him wrong.<p>Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly - The same idea is here expressed under another form, "as if" the teeth of wild animals were broken out, rendering them harmless. As God had thus disarmed his enemies in times past, the psalmist hoped that he would do the same thing now, and he confidently called on him to do it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Arise, O Lord&#8212;God is figuratively represented as asleep to denote His apparent indifference (Ps 7:6).

It is enough for the Lord to stand up, and all is well. He compares his enemies to wild beasts, and he declares that God hath broken their jaws, so that they could not injure him; "Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly." Or else he alludes to the peculiar temptations to which he was then exposed. They had spoken against him; God, therefore, has smitten them upon the cheek bone. They seemed as if they would devour him with their mouths; God hath broken their teeth, and let them say what they will, their toothless jaws shall not be able to devour him.

God sometimes, in the apprehension of his people, seems to be as if he was asleep: when he does not appear to them and for them, and does not exert his power on their behalf, then they call to him to awake and arise; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; and it may be some respect is had to the words of Moses when the ark set forward, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>; and it may be observed, that though David enjoyed so much peace and tranquillity of mind, and was in such high spirits as not to be afraid of ten thousands of men, yet he did not neglect the right means of deliverance and safety, prayer to God, who he knew was his God; and he addresses him as such, and uses his covenant interest in him, as an argument with him to arise and save him from his enemies, who was able to do it, and to whom salvation belongs: so Christ, his antitype, prayed to God as his God to save him, and was heard by him in like manner; so the saints call upon God in a day of trouble, cry to him in their distresses, to be delivered out of them; <p>for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone; to smite anyone upon the cheek is reckoned reproachful, and is casting contempt upon them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a> and the sense is, that God had poured contempt upon his enemies in time past, and had brought them to shame and confusion: hence he puts up the above prayer as a prayer of faith for salvation, founded on past experience of God's goodness; he prayed that his God would arise and save him, and he believed he would because he had hitherto appeared for him, and against his enemies; <p>thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly; who were like to beasts of prey, whose strength lies in their teeth, whereby they do the mischief they do; and the breaking of their teeth signifies the taking away from them the power of hurting, and refers to the victories which God had given David over the Philistines, Edomites, Syrians, and others; and maybe applied to Christ, and be expressive of sin, Satan, the world, and death, being overcome and abolished by him, and of the victory which the saints have through him over the same enemies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Arise, O Lord</span>] The opening words of the ancient marching-shout of Israel, rich in memories of deliverance and victory.

The buffet on the cheek was a climax of insult which shewed that all spirit and power of resistance were gone. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm" title="But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm" title="They have gaped on me with their mouth; they have smitten me on the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.">Job 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-30.htm" title="He gives his cheek to him that smites him: he is filled full with reproach.">Lamentations 3:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm" title="Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops: he has laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.">Micah 5:1</a>.

This call is generally made when God's forbearance towards his enemies is thought to have been excessive, and his tolerance of sinners too great. <span class="cmt_word">Save me, O my God</span>. David was in imminent danger. "All Israel" had come against him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15</a>). He was short of supplies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-29.htm">2 Samuel 17:29</a>). He was doubtful how God was disposed towards him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25, 26</a>). It was a time when, unless God would save, there could be no hope.

From its combination with the exclamative &#1502;&#1492;, &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is accented on the ultima (and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>); the accentuation of the perf. of verbs &#1506;&#1506; very frequently (even without the Waw consec.) follows the example of the strong verb, Ges. &#1431;67 rem. 12. A declaration then takes the place of the summons and the &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; implied in the predicate &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; now becomes the subject of participial predicates, which more minutely describe the continuing condition of affairs. The &#1500; of &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; signifies "in the direction of," followed by an address in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1</a> ( equals  "to"), or, as here and frequently (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-7.htm">Genesis 21:7</a>) followed by narration ( equals  "of," concerning). &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; instead of &#1500;&#1497; implies that the words of the adversaries pronounce a judgment upon his inmost life, or upon his personal relationship to God. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1492; is an intensive form for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, whether it be with a double feminine termination (Ges., Ew., Olsh.), or, with an original (accusative) ah of the direction: we regard this latter view, with Hupfeld, as more in accordance with the usage and analogy of the language (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-27.htm">Psalm 44:27</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a>, and &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; prop. &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, then as common Greek &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;). God is the ground of help; to have no more help in Him is equivalent to being rooted out of favour with God. Open enemies as well as disconcerted friends look upon him as one henceforth cast away. David had plunged himself into the deepest abyss of wretchedness by his adultery with Bathsheba, at the beginning of the very year in which, by the renewal of the Syro-Ammonitish war, he had reached the pinnacle of worldly power. The rebellion of Absolom belonged to the series of dire calamities which began to come upon him from that time. Plausible reasons were not wanting for such words as these which give up his cause as lost. </body></html>
