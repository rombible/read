The word "spoiled" here, as elsewhere in the Scriptures, means "plundered," not (as the word is now used) "corrupted." See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>.<p>They have slept their sleep - They are dead; they have slept their last sleep. Death, in the Scriptures, as in all other writings, is often compared with sleep.<p>And none of the men of might - The men who came forth for purposes of war and conquest.<p>Have found their hands - The Septuagint renders this, "Have found nothing in their hands;" that is, they have obtained no plunder. Luther renders it, "And all warriors must suffer their hands to fall." De Wette, "Have lost their hands?" The idea seems to be, that they had lost the use of their hands; that is, that they had no use for them, or did not find them of any use. They could not employ them for the purpose for which they were intended, but were suddenly stricken down. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/76.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. slept their sleep&#8212;died (Ps 13:3).<p>none &#8230; found &#8230; hands&#8212;are powerless.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/76.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Are spoiled</span> of all that glory and advantage which they either had already gotten, or further expected, from the success of their present expedition, which they promised to themselves.

The Assyrian army, its officers and generals, that came up against Jerusalem, with great resolution and courage, and with daring impiety and blasphemy against the God of heaven, as Rabshakeh and others; these were spoiled, and their armour and riches became a prey to those they thought to have made a prey of. So principalities and powers were spoiled by Christ upon the cross, and Satan, the strong man armed, has in the conversion of a sinner his armour taken from him, and his spoils divided by him that is stronger than he; and such as are stouthearted, and far from true righteousness, are stripped of their own, and made willing, in the day of Christ's power upon them, to submit to his; and as for antichrist, whose look is more stout than his fellows, that exalts himself above all that is called God, and opens his mouth in blasphemy against him and his followers, he shall be destroyed with the breath of Christ's mouth, and the brightness of his coming: or "the stout hearted have spoiled themselves" (a); as the Midianites did, or gave themselves for a prey; so the Targum, <p>"the stouthearted have cast off from them the weapons of war;'' <p>threw away their armour, and ran away, such of them as were not destroyed by the angel. It is observable, that the Hebrew word, translated "spoiled", is in the Syriac form: <p>they have slept their sleep: the sleep of death, as did the Assyrians when smitten by the angel, which was done in the night, when probably they were fast asleep, and so never awoke more, as the Babylonians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-57.htm">Jeremiah 51:57</a>. So Jezebel, or the Romish antichrist, shall be cast into a bed, and her children killed with death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-22.htm">Revelation 2:22</a>. Death is often in Scripture signified by a sleep, both the death of the righteous and of the wicked; but there is a difference between the one and the other; wherefore the death of the wicked here is called "their sleep"; the one sleep in Jesus, in his arms, and under his guardianship, the other not; to the one death is a true and proper rest from toil and labour, to the other only a cessation from doing mischief, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>, the one rests in hopes of a glorious resurrection, the other not; the one will awake in Christ's likeness, and to everlasting life; the other in the image of Satan, and to everlasting shame and contempt: <p>and none of the men of might have found their hands; none of the valiant soldiers in the Assyrian army could find their hands to fight their enemies, or defend themselves; as men in a deep sleep cannot find their hands to do anything, and are as if they had none, and still less in a dead sleep. The Targum is, <p>"they were not able to lay hold on their armour with their hands.'' <p>This was the case of them that were killed; and as for those that remained alive, they were struck with such a panic, that their hearts could not endure, nor their hands be strong when God thus dealt with them; and so it will be with the antichristian army at the battle of Armageddon; and so it is with the wicked at death, they cannot find their hands so as to prevent it; and when it has seized upon them, they cannot find their hands to do any more mischief. <p>(a) "praedae se exposnerunt", Tigurine version, Gejerus; "dediderunt se in praedam", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/76.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> found their hands.</span><p>(d) God has taken their spirits and strength from them as though their hands were cut off.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/76.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">The stouthearted</span>] For illustration cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-12.htm" title="Why it shall come to pass, that when the Lord has performed his whole work on mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.">Isaiah 10:12</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are spoiled</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">have let themselves be spoiled</span>.

The spiritual horns maintain the sovereignty over the natural. The Psalm closes as subjectively as it began. The prophetic picture is set in a lyric frame. </body></html>
