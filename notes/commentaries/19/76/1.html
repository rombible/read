It is true that God is known, or makes himself known everywhere; but it is also true that he does this in some places, and at some times, in a more marked and striking manner than he does in other places and at other times. The most clear and impressive displays of his character are among his own people - in the church. "His name is great in Israel." Among the people of Israel; or, among his own people. The meaning here is, that, by some act referred to in the psalm, he had so displayed his power and his mercy in favor of that people, as to make it proper that his name should be exalted or praised. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/76.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 76<p>Ps 76:1-12.

The occasion was probably the events narrated in 2Ki 19:35; Isa 37:1-28. (Compare Ps 46:1-11).<p>1, 2.

If unknown in all the world beside, he has so revealed himself to his people by his deeds of grace, that he is no unknown God to them. "His name is great in Israel." To be known, in the Lord's case, is to be honoured: those who know his name admire the greatness of it. Although Judah and Israel were unhappily divided politically, yet the godly of both nations were agreed concerning Jehovah their God; and truly whatever schisms may mar the visible church, the saints always "appear as one" in magnifying the Lord their God. Dark is the outer world, but within the favoured circle Jehovah is revealed, and is the adoration of all who behold him. The world knows him not and therefore blasphemes him, but his church is full of ardour to proclaim his fame unto the ends of the earth.<p>continued...Or, <span class="ital">for Asaph</span>.

God is to be known, and is made known, by his works of creation, and by his providences, and particularly by his judgments in the whole world, even among the Gentiles; and he was made known by his word and ordinances, his statutes and his judgments, among the Jews, to whom these were specially given; and he is made known by his Spirit, and in his Son in a spiritual and saving manner to such who are Jews inwardly, or the true circumcision: moreover this may be understood of Christ, God manifest in the flesh, and regard his appearance in human nature in the land of Judea; he was, according to prophecy, of the tribe of Judah as man, and was born in Bethlehem, a city in that tribe, where David was, and of the family of David, that formerly lived there: and he was made known by John the Baptist, who came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and by his being baptized of him in Jordan; by his own ministry and miracles in that land, and by the preaching of his apostles in the several cities of it, he was known in person to many; and by the fame of his doctrine and miracles to more, though seemingly but to few: <p>his name is great in Israel; he himself is great, for his name is himself, being the great God, and possessed of all divine perfections; his offices and titles are great, he is a great Saviour, a great High Priest, a great Prophet risen up in Israel, a great King, add the great Shepherd of the sheep; his works which make him known are great, his works of creation and providence, in which he is jointly concerned with his Father; the mighty works he did on earth, and especially the great work of our redemption; and his Gospel, which is called his name, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, brings glad tidings of great and good things; by means of which, and the wonderful things he did in the land of Israel, his fame was spread about in it, for he was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel; here his marvellous works were done, and his Gospel first preached, which afterwards went into all the earth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/76.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><<To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm <i>or</i> Song of Asaph.>> In Judah <i>is</i> God <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> known: his name <i>is</i> great in Israel.</span><p>(a) He declares that God's power is evidently seen in preserving his people and destroying his enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/76.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">known</span>] Lit., <span class="ital">one who has made Himself known</span>.

The connection with &#1493; in &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; presents a difficulty. Neither here nor anywhere else is it to be supposed that &#1493; is synonymous with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; but at any rate even &#1499;&#1497; might stand instead of it. For Hupfeld's attempt to explain it: and "near is Thy name" Thy wonders have declared; and Hitzig's: and Thou whose Name is near, they declare Thy wondrous works - are past remedy. Such a personification of wonders does not belong to the spirit of Hebrew poetry, and such a relative clause lies altogether beyond the bounds of syntax. If we would, however, take &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>, as a result of the thanksgiving (Campensis), then that for which thanks are rendered would remain undefined; neither will it do to take &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; as referring to the being inwardly present (Hengstenberg), since this, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-14.htm">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>), would require some addition, which should give to the nearness this reference to the mouth or to the heart. Thus, therefore, nothing remains for us but to connect the nearness of the Name of God as an outward fact with the earnest giving of thanks. The church has received the promise of an approaching judicial, redemptive revelation of God, and now says, "We give Thee thanks, we give thanks and near is Thy Name;" it welcomes the future act of God with heartfelt thanksgiving, all those who belong to it declare beforehand the wonders of God. Such was really the position of matters when in Hezekiah's time the oppression of the Assyrians had reached its highest point - Isaiah's promises of a miraculous divine deliverance were at that time before them, and the believing ones saluted beforehand, with thanksgiving, the "coming Name of Jahve" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which was to be expected after &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>.) does not follow until <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>. God Himself undertakes the confirmation of the forthcoming thanksgiving and praise by a direct announcement of the help that is hailed and near at hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>). It is not to be rendered, "when I shall seize," etc., for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a> has not the structure of an apodosis. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is confirmatory, and whatever interpretation we may give to it, the words of the church suddenly change into the words of God. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; in the language of prophecy, more especially of the apocalyptic character, is a standing expression fore the appointed time of the final judgment (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>). When this moment or juncture in the lapse of time shall have arrived, then God will seize or take possession of it (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495; in the unweakened original sense of taking hold of with energy, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>): He Himself will then interpose and hold judgment according to the strictly observed rule of right (&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, adverbial accusative, cf. &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>, and frequently). If it even should come to pass that the earth and all its inhabitants are melting away (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>), i.e., under the pressure of injustice (as is to be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>), are disheartened, scattered asunder, and are as it were in the act of dissolution, then He (the absolute I, &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;) will restrain this melting away: He setteth in their places the pillars, i.e., the internal shafts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-6.htm">Job 9:6</a>), of the earth, or without any figure: He again asserts the laws which lie at the foundation of its stability. &#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is a mood of certainty, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a> is a circumstantial clause placed first, after the manner of the Latin ablative absolute. Hitzig appropriately compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-9.htm">Proverbs 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-15.htm">Isaiah 23:15</a> may also be understood according to this bearing of the case.<p>The utterance of God is also continued after the Sela. It is not the people of God who turn to the enemies with the language of warning on the ground of the divine promise (Hengstenberg); the poet would then have said &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, or must at least have said &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. God Himself speaks, and His words are not yet peremptorily condemning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-16.htm">Psalm 50:16</a>., cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-11.htm">Psalm 46:11</a>, but admonitory and threatening, because it is not He who has already appeared for the final judgment who speaks, but He who announces His appearing. With &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; He tells the braggarts who are captivated with the madness of supposed greatness, and the evil-doers who lift up the horn or the head, <p>(Note: The head is called in Sanscrit iras, in Zend aranh,  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;; the horn in Sanscrit, ringa, i.e., (according to Burnlouf, Etudes, p. 19) that which proceeds from and projects out of the head (iras), Zend rva  equals  &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; (k&#803;arn).)<p>hat He will have once for all said to them, and what they are to suffer to be said to them for the short space of time till the judgment. The poet, if we have assigned the right date to the Psalm, has Rabshakeh and his colleagues before his mind, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>. The &#1500;, as in that passage, and like &#1488;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a> (vid., Khler), has the idea of a hostile tendency. &#1488;&#1500; rules also over <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>: "speak not insolence with a raised neck." It is not to be construed &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, with a stiff neck. Parallel passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, and more especially the primary passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>, show that &#1506;&#1514;&#1511; is an object-notion, and that &#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; by itself (with which, too, the accentuation harmonizes, since Munach here is the vicarius of a distinctive), according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-26.htm">Job 15:26</a>, has the sense of &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; or &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;. </body></html>
