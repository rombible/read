Hence, there would be less incongruity in the Hebrew than in our translation, where it is said that the "chariots" have fallen into a deep sleep. The idea may be either that horsemen and horses had fallen into a deep slumber, or that the rumbling of the chariot-wheels had ceased, and that there was a profound silence, like a deep sleep. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/76.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. chariot and horse&#8212;for those fighting on them (compare Ps 68:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/76.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The chariot and horse; </span> the men who rode upon and fought from chariots and horses, who fight with most advantage, and usually have most courage; and much more unable were their footmen to resist or avoid the stroke. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/76.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,.... The God of Jacob personally, and of his posterity, the children of Israel, and of the church, often so called who rebukes his people in love, but his enemies with furious rebukes, with rebukes in flames of fire; with such he rebukes the Heathen, destroys the wicked, and puts out their name for ever: <p>both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep; that is, the riders in chariots and on horses; such there were doubtless in the Assyrian army, it being usual to have such in great armies. Kimchi observes, that the word  translated "cast into a dead sleep", is in the singular number, and interprets it of the king, the head of the men of might: but Sennacherib, king of Assyria, was not slain, he departed to his own country; wherefore he applies it to Gog and Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1</a> and may very well be understood of the head of the apostasy, the king of the bottomless pit, the beast or false prophet, who being destroyed, the flesh of his captains and horsemen shall be the food of the fowls of the air, at the supper of the great God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/76.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/76.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">At thy rebuke</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-5.htm" title="You have rebuked the heathen, you have destroyed the wicked, you have put out their name for ever and ever.">Psalm 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-15.htm" title="Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.">Psalm 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm" title="The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.">Isaiah 17:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>are <span class="ital">cast into a dead sleep</span>] A word which denotes a deep, supernaturally caused slumber. It is usual to say that ‘chariot and horse’ stand by metonymy for charioteers and horsemen: but surely poetry imagines chariots as well as horses to be alive.

With &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; he contrasts himself as a member of the now still oppressed church with its proud oppressors: he will be a perpetual herald of the ever memorable deed of redemption. &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, says he, for, when he gives himself up so entirely to God the Redeemer, for him there is no dying. If he is a member of the ecclesia pressa, then he will also be a member of the ecclesia triumphans; for &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>).

On the figure compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>, and more especially the four horns in the second vision of Zechariah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>.. The plural is both &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;, because horns that do not consist of horn are meant. Horns are powers for offence and defence. The spiritual horns maintain the sovereignty over the natural. The Psalm closes as subjectively as it began. The prophetic picture is set in a lyric frame. </body></html>
