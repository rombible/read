The inhabitants of the earth have cause to tremble, but the Redeemer still waits to be gracious. Let all who hear, take warning, and seek his mercy. The more we humble ourselves before God, the more we exalt him; and let us be thus reverent, for he is holy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/99.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is great in Zion - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3</a>. The meaning here is, not that God is "absolutely" great - which is indeed true - but that there is a sense in which he has shown himself great "in Zion;" that is, in his manifestations toward his own people. He has evinced power in their behalf; he has interposed for them in times of danger; he has so discomfited their enemies as to show that he is a great God - a God worthy to be adored.<p>And he is high above all the people - Above all the nations. He has them under his control. He rules over all. The God who rules in Zion also rules all the nations of the earth; and his people, therefore, have special occasion to praise him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/99.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. great in Zion&#8212;where He dwells (Ps 9:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/99.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord is great in Zion:</span> in the Hebrew text the words lie in this order, <span class="ital">The Lord in Zion</span> (i.e. which dwelleth in Zion, as is said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-11.htm" title="Sing praises to the LORD, which dwells in Zion: declare among the people his doings.">Psalm 9:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-18.htm" title="Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwells in mount Zion.">Isaiah 8:18</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-21.htm" title="For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwells in Zion.">Joel 3:21</a></span>) is great. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Above all people; </span> above all the people of the earth, of whom he spake <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm" title="The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.">Psalm 99:1</a></span>, who shall exalt themselves against him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/99.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord is great in Zion,....
