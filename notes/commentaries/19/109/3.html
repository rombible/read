It is the unspeakable comfort of all believers, that whoever is against them, God is for them; and to him they may apply as to one pleased to concern himself for them. David's enemies laughed at him for his devotion, but they could not laugh him out of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/109.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They compassed me about also with words of hatred - They attacked me on every side; they assailed me, not merely in one form and direction, but in every form, and in every direction. I could turn no way - I could go nowhere - where I did not encounter these slanderous reports.<p>And fought against me without a cause - Contended against me, or fought against me, with "words." They sought to do me all the harm they could. The phrase "without a cause "means that he had given them no occasion for this conduct; he had not wronged them; it was mere malignity.

The hatred of the wicked for the good is a plain fact of history, and quite indisputable. "Words of hatred" are less patent, since they are often restrained from prudential considerations. But sometimes free vent is given to them (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And fought against me without a cause</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-161.htm">Psalm 119:161</a>). Saul's hatred towards David was markedly of this character - un-provoked by either act or word from its object. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/108.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7-14</a> forms this second half. The clause expressing the purpose with &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, as in its original, has the following &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; for its principal clause upon which it depends. Instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which one might have expected, the expression used here is &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; without any interchange of the mode of writing and of reading it; many printed copies have &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; here also; Baer, following Norzi, correctly has &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;. Instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, we here read &#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, which is less soaring. And instead of Cry aloud concerning me, O Philistia do I shout for joy (the triumphant cry of the victor); in accordance with which Hupfeld wishes to take &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; in the former as infinitive: "over (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;) Philistia is my shouting for joy" (&#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; instead of &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497;, since the infinitive does not admit of this pausal form of the imperative). For &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; we have here the more usual form of expression &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-12.htm">Psalm 108:12</a> is weakened by the omission of the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;). </body></html>
