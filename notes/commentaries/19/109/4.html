This may mean, either, that he bore these trials with a meek spirit, and did not allow these things to disturb his devotions; or, more probably, that he prayed constantly "for them;" he desired their good, and sought it from above. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/109.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

For the love that Christ showed to the Jews; to their bodies, in going about and healing all manner of diseases among them; to their souls, in preaching, the Gospel to them in each of their cities; and for the love he showed to mankind in coming into the world to save them, which should have commanded love again; but instead of this they became his implacable adversaries: they acted the part of Satan; they were as so many Satans to him, as the word signifies. <p>But I give myself unto prayer; or "I am a man of prayer" (y); as Aben Ezra and Kimchi supply it; so he was in the days of his flesh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, he was constant at it, and fervent in it; sometimes a whole night together at it: his usual method was, when at Jerusalem, to teach in the temple in the daytime, and at night to go to the mount of Olives, and there abide and pray, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>. This was the armour he alone made use of against his enemies, when they fought against him, and acted the part of an adversary to him; he betook himself to nothing else but prayer; he did not return railing for railing, but committed himself in prayer to God, who judgeth righteously, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>, yea, he prayed for those his adversaries: and so Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret it, that he was a man of prayer for them, and prayed for them; as it is certain Christ did, when he was encompassed by his enemies, and they were venting all their spite and malice against him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>. <p>(y)  "et ego vir orationis", Pagninus, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/109.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For my love they are my adversaries: <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> but I <i>give myself unto</i> prayer.</span><p>(b) To declare that I had no other refuge, but you, in whom my conscience was at rest.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/109.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. In return for my love they behave as adversaries unto me,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Though I (gave myself unto) prayer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Their hostility is not merely gratuitous (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-3.htm" title="They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.">Psalm 109:3</a></span>); it is an actual return of evil for good. The Heb. word for ‘adversaries’ is characteristic of this Psalms , vv20, 29; cp. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm" title="Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.">Psalm 109:6</a></span> : elsewhere in the Psalter only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-20.htm" title="They also that render evil for good are my adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.">Psalm 38:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-13.htm" title="Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.">Psalm 71:13</a>. It may mean not ‘enemies’ in general, but ‘accusers,’ opponents in a court of law. For the forcible idiom <span class="ital">I</span> (<span class="ital">was</span>) <span class="ital">prayer</span> cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-7.htm" title="I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.">Psalm 120:7</a>, “I am peace”; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm" title="Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.">Psalm 110:3</a>, “Thy people are freewill offerings.” The A.V., <span class="ital">But I</span> give myself unto <span class="ital">prayer</span>, retained in R.V., takes the meaning to be that in his need he commits his cause to God (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm" title="But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of your mercy hear me, in the truth of your salvation.">Psalm 69:13</a>). But the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm" title="But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.">Psalm 35:13</a> is decidedly in favour of supposing that his prayers for them in past times are meant, and this explanation suits the context best. To these prayers he refers as the proof of his love, the good for which they are now (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-5.htm" title="And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.">Psalm 109:5</a></span>) requiting him with evil.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/109.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For my love they are my adversaries</span>. The tenderness and kindness of the good towards wicked men does not soften them. Rather it provokes them to greater hostility. This was seen clearly in the instance of Saul. <span class="cmt_word">But I give myself unto prayer</span>; literally, <span class="accented">but I prayer</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "but I am wholly prayer," "I do nothing during their attacks on me but pray for them." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/108.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7-14</a> forms this second half. The clause expressing the purpose with &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, as in its original, has the following &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; for its principal clause upon which it depends. Instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which one might have expected, the expression used here is &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; without any interchange of the mode of writing and of reading it; many printed copies have &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; here also; Baer, following Norzi, correctly has &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;. Instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, we here read &#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, which is less soaring. And instead of Cry aloud concerning me, O Philistia do I shout for joy (the triumphant cry of the victor); in accordance with which Hupfeld wishes to take &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; in the former as infinitive: "over (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;) Philistia is my shouting for joy" (&#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; instead of &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497;, since the infinitive does not admit of this pausal form of the imperative). For &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; we have here the more usual form of expression &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-12.htm">Psalm 108:12</a> is weakened by the omission of the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;). </body></html>
