Their children and children’s children have since been continually vagabonds upon the earth, in the state of Cain, when he had murdered his righteous brother, not cut off, but marvellously preserved for punishment and wo.” Thus also Dr. Hammond on these verses: “By this is described, in a very lively manner, the condition of the Jewish posterity, ever since their ancestors fell under that signal vengeance for the crucifying of Christ. 1st, Their desolations and devastations in their own country, and being rejected thence. 2d, Their continual wanderings from place to place, scattered over the face of the earth: and, 3d, Their remarkable covetousness, keeping them always poor and beggarly, be they never so rich, and continually labouring and moiling for gain, as the poorest are wont to do; and this is continually the constant course attending this people, wheresoever they are scattered.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/109.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>109:6-20 The Lord Jesus may speak here as a Judge, denouncing sentence on some of his enemies, to warn others. When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish, horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners, tremble and repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/109.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let his children be fatherless - Hebrew, "his sons." This is what "always" occurs when a criminal who is a father is executed. It is one of the consequences of crime; and if the officer of justice does his duty, of course, the sons of such a man "must" be made fatherless. The prayer is, simply, that justice may be done, and all this is but an enumeration of what must follow from the proper execution of the laws.<p>And his wife a widow - This implies no malice against the wife, but may be consistent with the most tender compassion for her sufferings. It is simply one of the consequences which must follow from the punishment of a bad man. The enumeration of these things shows the enormity of the crime - just as the consequences which follow from the execution of a murderer are an illustration of the divine sense of the evil of the offence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/109.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. Let his family share the punishment, his children be as wandering beggars to prowl in their desolate homes, a greedy and relentless creditor grasp his substance, his labor, or the fruit of it, enure to strangers and not his heirs, and his unprotected, fatherless children fall in want, so that his posterity shall utterly fail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/109.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Fatherless; </span> whilst they are but children, and so unable to provide for themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A widow; </span> either made a widow by his death; or constantly a widow; all persons abhorring her who was related to so vile a miscreant. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/109.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. This sometimes is the case of good men, who leave widows and fatherless children, whom the Lord shows mercy to; being the Father of the fatherless, and the Judge of the widow, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>, but sometimes it is threatened and comes as a judgment, when the Lord shows no mercy and favour to them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>. And this is the case here, which very probably was literally fulfilled in Judas, who might have a wife and children; since it looks as if the other apostles had, and certain it is that one of them had a wife, even Peter, in the times of Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>. And this was verified in the people of the Jews; whom the Lord divorced from himself, and wrote a "loammi" upon them, and left them as orphans and fatherless, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>. This will never be the case of Christ's people, or the Christian church, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>, though it will be of the antichristian one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/109.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/109.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9, 10</span>. The curse of his misdeeds falls even upon his wife and children. This is the climax of awfulness in the imprecation. But a man’s family was regarded as part of himself; his punishment was not complete unless they were included in it; and for full retribution they must share his ruin, for doubtless, this man’s schemes, if successful, would have involved the ruin of the Psalmist’s family.

"God of my praise" is equivalent to God, who art my praise, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-14.htm">Jeremiah 17:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>. The God whom the Psalmist has hitherto had reason to praise will also now show Himself to him as worthy to be praised. Upon this faith he bases the prayer: be not silent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-22.htm">Psalm 35:22</a>)! A mouth such as belongs to the "wicked," a mouth out of which comes "deceit," have they opened against him; they have spoken with him a tongue (accusative, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-6.htm">Psalm 64:6</a>), i.e., a language, of falsehood. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; of things and utterances as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a>. It would be capricious to take the suffix of &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a> as genit. object. (love which they owe me), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-5.htm">Psalm 109:5</a> as genit. subject.; from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-21.htm">Psalm 38:21</a> it may be seen that the love which he has shown to them is also meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>. The assertion that he is "prayer" is intended to say that he, repudiating all revenges of himself, takes refuge in God in prayer and commits his cause into His hands. They have loaded him with evil for good, and hatred for the love he has shown to them. Twice he lays emphasis on the fact that it is love which they have requited to him with its opposite. Perfects alternate with aorists: it is no enmity of yesterday; the imprecations that follow presuppose an inflexible obduracy on the side of the enemies. </body></html>
