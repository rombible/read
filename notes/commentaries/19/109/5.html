It is the unspeakable comfort of all believers, that whoever is against them, God is for them; and to him they may apply as to one pleased to concern himself for them.

This often occurred in the life of David; it was constant in the life of the Saviour; it is habitually manifested by people toward God; it is often experienced by good men now; it "may" occur in the life of any man - and if it "does" occur to us, we should not think that any strange thing has happened to us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/109.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

The clause expressing the purpose with &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, as in its original, has the following &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; for its principal clause upon which it depends. Instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which one might have expected, the expression used here is &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; without any interchange of the mode of writing and of reading it; many printed copies have &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493; here also; Baer, following Norzi, correctly has &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;. Instead of &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm">Psalm 60:9</a>, we here read &#1500;&#1497;...&#1500;&#1497;, which is less soaring. And instead of Cry aloud concerning me, O Philistia do I shout for joy (the triumphant cry of the victor); in accordance with which Hupfeld wishes to take &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; in the former as infinitive: "over (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; instead of &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;) Philistia is my shouting for joy" (&#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497; instead of &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506;&#1497;, since the infinitive does not admit of this pausal form of the imperative). For &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512; we have here the more usual form of expression &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-12.htm">Psalm 108:12</a> is weakened by the omission of the &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;). </body></html>
