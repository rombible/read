Or, rather, as the Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">יקללו המה</span>, <span class="ital">jekalelu hemma, </span>is literally rendered, <span class="ital">They will curse; </span>I expect nothing else from them; <span class="greekheb">ואתה תברךְ</span>, <span class="ital">veatta tebareck, but thou wilt bless </span>me, and all those that trust in thee; for, <span class="ital">blessed is the man who trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. When they arise let them be ashamed — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">קמו ויבשׁו</span>, <span class="ital">kamu vajeboshu, they have arisen, </span>namely, have taken active measures against me; <span class="ital">they shall be ashamed — </span>Disappointed of their wicked hopes and designs against me, and <span class="ital">covered with their own confusion as with a mantle — </span>For that unexpected destruction which they have brought upon themselves. Observe, reader, if God bless us, we need not care who curseth us; for <span class="ital">how can they curse whom God hath not cursed? </span>Nay, whom he hath blessed? <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-28.htm" title="And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks toward Jeshimon.">Numbers 23:28</a>. Men’s curses are impotent, God’s blessings are omnipotent. And those whom men unjustly curse, may in faith expect and pray for God’s blessing, his special blessing. When the Pharisees cast out the poor man for confessing Christ, <span class="ital">Christ found him, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-35.htm" title="Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?">John 9:35</a>. When men, without cause, say all the ill they can of us, and wish all the ills they can to us, we may with comfort lift up our hearts to God in this petition: <span class="ital">Let them curse, but bless thou.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/109.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>109:21-31 The psalmist takes God's comforts to himself, but in a very humble manner. He was troubled in mind. His body was wasted, and almost worn away. But it is better to have leanness in the body, while the soul prospers and is in health, than to have leanness in the soul, while the body is feasted. He was ridiculed and reproached by his enemies. But if God bless us, we need not care who curses us; for how can they curse whom God has not cursed; nay, whom he has blessed? He pleads God's glory, and the honour of his name. Save me, not according to my merit, for I pretend to none, but according to thy-mercy. He concludes with the joy of faith, in assurance that his present conflicts would end in triumphs. Let all that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him. Jesus, unjustly put to death, and now risen again, is an Advocate and Intercessor for his people, ever ready to appear on their behalf against a corrupt world, and the great accuser.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/109.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Help me, O Lord my God ... - Stand by me; interpose. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/109.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26, 27.

Jehovah the Father is here addressed, who is the God of Christ, as Christ is man; who formed him, supported him, and glorified him; and whom Christ loved, believed in, obeyed and prayed unto; nor did he pray to a God that could not hear, but to one that was able to save him from death: as a divine Person he needed no help, being the mighty God, the most Mighty, the Almighty: but as man he did, being encompassed about with infirmities; and as Mediator help was promised him, he expected it, and he had it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-21.htm">Psalm 89:21</a>. <p>O save me according to thy mercy; or "kindness"; as before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-21.htm">Psalm 109:21</a> from sufferings, and out of them; from death and the grave, as he was; or his people by him, who are saved not by works of righteousness, but according to the mercy of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/109.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Help me, O LORD my God: O <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> save me according to thy mercy:</span><p>(o) The more grievously Satan assailed him, the more earnest and instant was he in prayer.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/109.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>.

The verb, and more especially in Niph., is proved to be Hebrew by <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>. Such an one who without anything else is of a terrified heart, inasmuch as he has been made to feel the wrath of God most keenly, this man has persecuted with a deadly hatred. He had experienced kindness (&#1495;&#1505;&#1491;) in a high degree, but he blotted out of his memory that which he had experienced, not for an instant imagining that he too on his part had to exercise &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;. The Poel &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1514; instead of &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; points to the agonizing death (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-10.htm">Ezekiel 28:10</a> &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;) to which he exposes God's anointed. The fate of the shedder of blood is not expressed after the manner of a wish in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-16.htm">Psalm 109:16-18</a>, but in the historical form, as being the result that followed of inward necessity from the matter of fact of the course which he had himself determined upon. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; seq. acc. signifies to surprise, suddenly attack any one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>. The three figures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18</a> are climactic: he has clothed himself in cursing, he has drunk it in like water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>), it has penetrated even to the marrow of his bones, like the oily preparations which are rubbed in and penetrate to the bones.n In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-19.htm">Psalm 109:19</a> the emphasis rests upon &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; and upon &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;. The summarizing <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-20.htm">Psalm 109:20</a> is the close of a strophe. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, an earned reward, here punishment incurred, is especially frequent in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>; it also occurs once even in the Tra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>. Those who answer the loving acts of the righteous with such malevolence in word and in deed commit a satanic sin for which there is no forgiveness. The curse is the fruit of their own choice and deed.
