He was troubled in mind. His body was wasted, and almost worn away. But it is better to have leanness in the body, while the soul prospers and is in health, than to have leanness in the soul, while the body is feasted. He was ridiculed and reproached by his enemies. But if God bless us, we need not care who curses us; for how can they curse whom God has not cursed; nay, whom he has blessed? He pleads God's glory, and the honour of his name. Save me, not according to my merit, for I pretend to none, but according to thy-mercy. He concludes with the joy of faith, in assurance that his present conflicts would end in triumphs. Let all that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him. Jesus, unjustly put to death, and now risen again, is an Advocate and Intercessor for his people, ever ready to appear on their behalf against a corrupt world, and the great accuser.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/109.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth - I will sing abundant praises to him.

The twofold name Jahve Adonaj (vid., Symbolae, p. 16) corresponds to the deep-breathed complaint. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, deal with me, i.e., succouring me, does not greatly differ from &#1500;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>. The confirmation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-21.htm">Psalm 109:21</a>, runs like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-17.htm">Psalm 69:17</a> : Thy loving-kindness is &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, absolutely good, the ground of everything that is good and the end of all evil. Hitzig conjectures, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-17.htm">Psalm 69:17</a>, &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1498; &#1499;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, "according to the goodness of Thy loving-kindness;" but this formula is without example: "for Thy loving-kindness is good" is a statement of the motive placed first and corresponding to the "for thy Name's sake." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm">Psalm 109:22</a> (a variation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-5.htm">Psalm 55:5</a>) &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, not &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, is traditional; this &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, as being verb. denom. from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, signifies to be pierced, and is therefore equivalent to &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>). The metaphor of the shadow in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-23.htm">Psalm 109:23</a> is as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-12.htm">Psalm 102:12</a>. When the day declines, the shadow lengthens, it becomes longer and longer (Virgil, majoresque cadunt altis de montibus umbrae), till it vanishes in the universal darkness. Thus does the life of the sufferer pass away. The poet intentionally uses the Niph. &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (another reading is &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;); it is a power rushing upon him from without that drives him away thus after the manner of a shadow into the night. The locust or grasshopper (apart from the plague of the locusts) is proverbial as being a defenceless, inoffensive little creature that is soon driven away, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>. &#1504;&#1504;&#1506;&#1512;, to be shaken out or off (cf. Arabic na&#8219;u&#770;ra, a water-wheel that fills its clay-vessels in the river and empties them out above, and &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-16.htm">Zechariah 11:16</a>, where Hitzig wishes to read &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, dispulsio  equals  dispulsi). The fasting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm">Psalm 109:24</a> is the result of the loathing of all food which sets in with deep grief. &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; signifies to waste away so that there is no more fat left.<p>(Note: The verbal group &#1499;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1499;&#1495;&#1491;, Arab. h&#803;ajda, kah&#803;ut&#803;a, etc. has the primary signification of withdrawal and taking away or decrease; to deny is the same as to withdraw from agreement, and he becomes thin from whom the fat withdraws, goes away. Saadia compares on this passage (&#1508;&#1512;&#1492;) &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; &#1499;&#1495;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, a lean cow, Berachoth 32a. In like manner Targum II renders <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a> &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1488; &#1499;&#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1488;, the lean kine.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-25.htm">Psalm 109:25</a> &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is designedly rendered prominent: in this the form of his affliction he is the butt of their reproaching, and they shake their heads doubtfully, looking upon him as one who is punished of God beyond all hope, and giving him up for lost. It is to be interpreted thus after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>. </body></html>
