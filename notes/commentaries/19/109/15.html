When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish, horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners, tremble and repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/109.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let them be before the Lord continually - Let their sins never pass from the mind of God. Let him never so forget them as not to inflict punishment for them.<p>That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth - That they may be wholly forgotten among people. Let their very name perish; and let the offender in this case be in the condition of those who have no ancestors to whom they can refer with pride and pleasure.

Having died off from this position before his time, he shall leave behind him a family deeply reduced in circumstances, whose former dwelling - place-he was therefore wealthy - becomes "ruins." His children wander up and down far from these ruins (&#1502;&#1503; as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-4.htm">Job 28:4</a>) and beg (&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, Sir. 40:28  equals  &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>).
