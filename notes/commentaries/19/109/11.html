When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish, horror, and despair!

The word rendered "catch" - &#1504;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;  na&#770;qash - is a word which means to lay a snare, as for birds and wild animals, and hence, it means to ensnare, to entrap, to catch. The word rendered "extortioner" means literally one who lends or borrows money; a money-loaner; in our times, a "broker." Here it refers to one who loaned money on interest; or who took advantage of the necessities of others to lend money at high rates - thus sooner or later seizing upon and securing the property of another. The prayer here is, that he might be in such circumstances as to make it necessary to fall into the hands of those who would thus come into possession of all his property.<p>And let the strangers spoil his labor - Let strangers "plunder" his labor; that is, the fruit of his labor. Let them seize and possess what he has earned and gained to enjoy it themselves. The remarks made on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>, will apply to this verse and the following. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/109.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10.

Or, "lay a snare for all" (c); as the Romans did, by bringing in their army, invading the land of Judea, and besieging the city of Jerusalem; who are "the extortioner or exacter that demanded tribute of them"; which they refused to pay, and therefore they seized on all they had for it. The Syriac and Arabic versions render it, "the creditor"; who sometimes for a debt would take wife and children, and all that a man had; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>. It might be literally true of Judas; who dying in debt, his wife and children, and all he had, might be laid hold on for payment. <p>And let the stranger spoil his labour; plunder his house of all his goods and substance he had been labouring for: which was true of the Romans, who were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel; who came into the land, and spoiled their houses, fields, and vineyards, they had been labouring in; they took away their place and nation, and all they had, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>. <p>(c) "illaqueet", Pagninus, Montanus, Musculus, Piscator, Gejerus; "iretiat", Vatablus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/109.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</span><p>(f) He declares that the curse of God lies on the extortioners, who thinking to enrich their children by their unlawfully gotten goods, are by God's just judgment deprived of all.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/109.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>.

"God of my praise" is equivalent to God, who art my praise, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-14.htm">Jeremiah 17:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>. The God whom the Psalmist has hitherto had reason to praise will also now show Himself to him as worthy to be praised. Upon this faith he bases the prayer: be not silent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-22.htm">Psalm 35:22</a>)! A mouth such as belongs to the "wicked," a mouth out of which comes "deceit," have they opened against him; they have spoken with him a tongue (accusative, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-6.htm">Psalm 64:6</a>), i.e., a language, of falsehood. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; of things and utterances as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm">Psalm 35:20</a>.

(love which they owe me), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-5.htm">Psalm 109:5</a> as genit. subject.; from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-21.htm">Psalm 38:21</a> it may be seen that the love which he has shown to them is also meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>. The assertion that he is "prayer" is intended to say that he, repudiating all revenges of himself, takes refuge in God in prayer and commits his cause into His hands. They have loaded him with evil for good, and hatred for the love he has shown to them. Twice he lays emphasis on the fact that it is love which they have requited to him with its opposite. Perfects alternate with aorists: it is no enmity of yesterday; the imprecations that follow presuppose an inflexible obduracy on the side of the enemies. </body></html>
