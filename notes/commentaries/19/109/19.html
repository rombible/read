When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! How it will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, with pain, anguish, horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners, tremble and repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/109.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him - He has chosen to put it on, to wear it, to appear in it; so let him constantly feel its consequences.

(So) let it be unto him as the garment in which he wraps himself,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And as the belt wherewith he girds himself continually.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As the text stands, the verbs in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/109-17.htm" title="As he loved cursing, so let it come to him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him....">Psalm 109:17-18</a></span> cannot be rendered as optatives, <span class="ital">let it come … let it be far … let it come</span>. At first sight it is tempting to make the slight change in vocalisation which would give this sense (cp. LXX and Jer.); but the text admits of a good explanation. The past tenses <span class="ital">it came … it was far … it came</span> are not to be explained as ‘futures of certainty,’ water and oil (possibly with a reference to the water of jealousy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-22.htm" title="And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels, to make your belly to swell, and your thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.">Numbers 5:22</a>) being regarded as figures for what will inevitably penetrate his whole body. Water and oil naturally denote what is refreshing and strengthening (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm" title="How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinks iniquity like water?">Job 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm" title="What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water?">Job 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm" title="It shall be health to your navel, and marrow to your bones.">Proverbs 3:8</a>). The wicked man deliberately chose the policy of cursing, and welcomed it to a home in his heart; he banished blessing from his thoughts and purposes. Cursing became the habit of mind, which he assumed each day as naturally as his garment: it was a positive refreshment and invigoration of his whole being. Therefore let it cleave inseparably to him and let him never be able to free himself from it Let it cling to him like a Nessus-shirt of venom.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/109.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him</span>.
