These verses express facts, and the imprecation follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-19.htm" title="Let it be to him as the garment which covers him, and for a girdle with which he is girded continually.">Psalm 109:19</a>. Render—<p>He loved cursing; and it comes;<p>He delighted not in blessing; and it departs;<p>Yea, he clothed himself in cursing as with his cloak,<p>And it came like water into his bowels,<p>And like oil into his bones;<p>May it be, &c.<p>Comp. the proverb, “Curses, like chickens, always come home to roost.”<p>The fabled shirt of Nessus, which ate into the mighty form of Hercules, has suggested itself to commentators in illustration of this image. In a good sense the same figure is a favourite one with the Hebrews. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-5.htm" title="And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.">Isaiah 11:5</a>.)<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-19.htm" title="Let it be to him as the garment which covers him, and for a girdle with which he is girded continually.">Psalm 109:19</a> has struck most commentators as an anticlimax, and the quotation theory is supported by this fact. But imprecations show their impotence in this way; the angry soul can never be quite “unpacked with curses;” the language of passion exhausts itself too soon, and a violent speech often dies away in unintelligible mutterings or even gestures of rage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/109.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/109-17.htm" title="As he loved cursing, so let it come to him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him....">Psalm 109:17-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">As he loved cursing — </span>To curse others, as appears from the blessing here opposed to it, and from the next verse; to wish and to procure mischief to others; <span class="ital">so let it come unto him — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">תבואהו</span>, <span class="ital">teboeehu, it shall come unto him; </span>the mischief in which he delighted, and which he both wished and designed to others, shall fall upon himself. <span class="ital">As he delighted not in blessing — </span>In desiring and promoting the welfare of others; <span class="ital">so let it be, </span>&c. — Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">תרחק</span>, <span class="ital">tirchak, it shall be far from him — </span>He shall never meet with the blessing of those righteous courses which he always hated and avoided. <span class="ital">As he clothed himself with cursing — </span>As his very business was to slander others everywhere, taking a pride in the mischievous effects of his wretched lies; <span class="ital">so let it come — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ותבא</span>, <span class="ital">vatabo, it shall come, into his bowels, like water — </span>He shall feel the miserable fruit of his wickedness spreading itself, like the water he drinks, to every artery and vein; and sticking as close to him as oil unto the bones. <span class="ital">As the garment which covereth him — </span>It shall compass him on every side as a garment; he shall be involved in perpetual misfortunes and miseries, and never be able to shake them off. <span class="ital">And as a girdle wherewith he is girded continually — </span>He shall be surrounded with, and entangled in, straits and difficulties, without any possibility of being extricated from them.

When men reject the salvation of Christ, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See what hurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates of others to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, and brings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, that mischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of the sentence, Go, ye cursed, upon the bodies and souls of the wicked!

He has chosen this as his portion; let it be his. This, in the original, is in the indicative mood, and not, as in our version, in the optative form: "He loved cursing, and it has come upon him; he did not delight in blessing, and it is far from him." Still, the connection would rather seem to require that we should understand this as a prayer, and not as an affirmation, for the object of the whole seems not to be to state what had come upon him, but what the psalmist wished might come upon him.<p>As he delighted not in blessing ... - As he had no pleasure in wishing that others might be happy, or in any measures which would tend to promote their happiness, so let everything that could be regarded as a blessing be put far from him; let him know nothing of it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/109.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-19.

Judas loved that which brought a curse upon him, sin; and so he may be said to love the curse; just as sinners are said to love death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-36.htm">Proverbs 8:36</a>. He was desirous of and sought after it, to bring Christ to an accursed death; and which he accomplished and pleased himself with; and therefore it was a just retaliation upon him that the curse should light on him, and he himself come to a shameful and ignominious death. The Jews loved the cursing law, the flying roll, called the curse in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-2.htm">Zechariah 5:2</a>, which curses every transgressor of it: they boasted of it, rested in it, and sought for righteousness by it; and submitted not unto, but despised, the righteousness of Christ; and therefore it was but just they should come under the curse of the law: they imprecated the curse on them and their children, saying, "His blood be upon us and them", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a> and which accordingly came upon them, and remains to this day. <p>As he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him; Judas delighted not in the good will and good wishes of any to Christ, as appears from his dislike of the ointment being poured on his head by the poor woman, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>, and so the Jews were displeased at the children, and at the disciples in the temple, blessing Christ, pronouncing him blessed, and wishing blessings to him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-15.htm">Matthew 21:15</a>, yea, they delighted not in their own blessedness, or in that which only could give it to them; they delighted not in Christ, who was sent to bless them, but despised and rejected him; nor in the Gospel, which is full of blessings; and particularly not in the doctrine of justification by Christ's righteousness, which commonly makes a man blessed: yea, in a sense, they judged themselves unworthy of everlasting life; and therefore it was but a righteous thing that blessing should be far from Judas and the Jews, as it was; even temporal, spiritual, and eternal blessings: yet there have been a sort of heretics (e), that have highly praised and commended Judas, as doing a brave and noble action in betraying Christ, whereby the work of salvation was hastened. <p>(e) Epiphan. contra Haeres. l. 1.
