This relates to that part of the Jewish history which is recorded 1 Samuel 4.

God gave them his testimonies, but they turned back. Presumptuous sins render even Israelites hateful to God's holiness, and exposed to his justice. Those whom the Lord forsakes become an easy prey to the destroyer. And sooner or later, God will disgrace his enemies. He set a good government over his people; a monarch after his own heart. With good reason does the psalmist make this finishing, crowning instance of God's favour to Israel; for David was a type of Christ, the great and good Shepherd, who was humbled first, and then exalted; and of whom it was foretold, that he should be filled with the Spirit of wisdom and understanding. On the uprightness of his heart, and the skilfulness of his hands, all his subjects may rely; and of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. Every trial of human nature hitherto, confirms the testimony of Scripture, that the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, and nothing but being created anew by the Holy Ghost can cure the ungodliness of any.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh - The tabernacle or tent which had been erected at Shiloh. He forsook that as a place where he was to be worshipped; that is, he caused his tabernacle, or his place of worship, to be erected in another place, to wit, on Mount Zion. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-68.htm">Psalm 78:68</a>. The name Shiloh means properly a place of rest, and seems to have been given to this place as such a place, or as a place where the ark might abide after its migrations. Shiloh was a city within the limits of the tribe of Ephraim, on a mountain north of Bethel. Here the ark of God remained for many years after it came into the promised land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-12.htm">Judges 21:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-24.htm">1 Samuel 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3-4</a>.

The poet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49-51</a> brings the fifth Egyptian plague, the pestilence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1-7</a>), and the tenth and last, the smiting of the first-born (&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1</a>, together. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a> sounds like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a> (cf. below <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a>). &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are not wicked angels, against which view Hengstenberg refers to the scriptural thesis of Jacobus Ode in his work De Angelis, Deum ad puniendos malos homines mittere bonos angelos et ad castigandos pios usurpare malos, but angels that bring misfortune. The mode of construction belongs to the chapter of the genitival subordination of the adjective to the substantive, like &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-18.htm">Numbers 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-24.htm">Numbers 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>, and the Arabic msjdu 'l-ja&#770;m&#8219;, the mosque of the assembling one, i.e., the assembling (congregational) mosque, therefore: angels (not of the wicked ones  equals  wicked angels, which it might signify elsewhere, but) of the evil ones  equals  evil, misfortune-bringing angels (Ew. &#1431;287, a).

When now these plagues which softened their Pharaoh went forth upon the Egyptians, God procured for His people a free departure, He guided flock-like (&#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1512; like &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-24.htm">Jeremiah 31:24</a>, with Dag. implicitum), i.e., as a shepherd, the flock of His people (the favourite figure of the Psalms of Asaph) through the desert, - He led them safely, removing all terrors out of the way and drowning their enemies in the Red Sea, to His holy territory, to the mountain which (&#1494;&#1492;) His right hand had acquired, or according to the accents (cf. supra, p. 104): to the mountain there (&#1494;&#1492;), which, etc. It is not Zion that is meant, but, as in the primary passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>., in accordance with the parallelism (although this is not imperative) and the usage of the language, which according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>, is incontrovertible, the whole of the Holy Land with its mountains and valleys (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:11</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; is the poetical equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a>, and frequently.

Instead of &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; from &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, the word here is &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; from &#1506;&#1491;&#1492; (a derivative of &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, not &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;). Since the apostasy did not gain ground until after the death of Joshua and Eleazar, it is the Israel of the period of the Judges that we are to think of here. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a>, is not: a bow of slackness, but: a bow of deceit; for the point of comparison, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-16.htm">Hosea 7:16</a>, is its missing the mark: a bow that discharges its arrow in a wrong direction, that makes no sure shot. The verb &#1512;&#1502;&#1492; signifies not only to allow to hang down slack (cogn. &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;), but also, according to a similar conception to spe dejicere, to disappoint, deny. In the very act of turning towards God, or at least being inclined towards Him by His tokens of power and loving-kindness, they turned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>) like a vow that misses the mark and disappoints both aim and expectation. The expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a> is like <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; refers to their prayer to the Ba(a4lim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>). The word &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, which occurs three times in this Psalm, is a word belonging to Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-26.htm">Deuteronomy 3:26</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-59.htm">Psalm 78:59</a> is purposely worded exactly like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21</a>. The divine purpose of love spurned by the children just as by the fathers, was obliged in this case, as in the former, to pass over into angry provocation. </body></html>
