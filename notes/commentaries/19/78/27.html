Sin dispirits men, and takes away the heart. Forgetfulness of God's works is the cause of disobedience to his laws. This narrative relates a struggle between God's goodness and man's badness. The Lord hears all our murmurings and distrusts, and is much displeased. Those that will not believe the power of God's mercy, shall feel the fire of his indignation. Those cannot be said to trust in God's salvation as their happiness at last, who can not trust his providence in the way to it. To all that by faith and prayer, ask, seek, and knock, these doors of heaven shall at any time be opened; and our distrust of God is a great aggravation of our sins. He expressed his resentment of their provocation; not in denying what they sinfully lusted after, but in granting it to them. Lust is contented with nothing. Those that indulge their lust, will never be estranged from it. Those hearts are hard indeed, that will neither be melted by the mercies of the Lord, nor broken by his judgments. Those that sin still, must expect to be in trouble still. And the reason why we live with so little comfort, and to so little purpose, is, because we do not live by faith. Under these rebukes they professed repentance, but they were not sincere, for they were not constant. In Israel's history we have a picture of our own hearts and lives. God's patience, and warnings, and mercies, imbolden them to harden their hearts against his word. And the history of kingdoms is much the same. Judgments and mercies have been little attended to, until the measure of their sins has been full. And higher advantages have not kept churches from declining from the commandments of God. Even true believers recollect, that for many a year they abused the kindness of Providence. When they come to heaven, how will they admire the Lord's patience and mercy in bringing them to his kingdom!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He rained flesh also upon them as dust - The flesh of quails, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>.

By "flesh" is meant fowl, as the following clause shows; for there is flesh of birds, as well as of other creatures, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-39.htm">1 Corinthians 15:39</a> and the quails which are here meant may be very fitly called flesh, since they are, for their size, a very plump, fat, and fleshy bird: <p>and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea; or "fowl of wing" (h): winged fowls, so the Targum; fowl that flies; and therefore it was the more remarkable that these should be rained and fall, and be taken by the Israelites; and which fell in great numbers, as is signified by these phrases, the dust and the sand of the sea; for there fell enough to feed six hundred thousand men, beside women and children, for a month together; they lay in heaps, two cubits high, on one another, and everyone that gathered them brought in ten homers; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19</a>, which is the history referred to; and quails are used to fly together in large bodies; and sometimes, as Pliny (i) relates, will light on ships at sea, and sink them with their numbers. Some think one sort of locusts is meant, which were used for food, and was very delicious food; and the circumstances of bringing them with an east or southeast wind, their falling in heaps, and being gathered in bushels, and spread about to be dried in the sun, seem to favour such a sense; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-20.htm">Numbers 11:20</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-32.htm">Numbers 11:32</a>. The ancients interpret this mystically of the flesh of Christ, whose flesh is meat indeed, delicious food for faith, as the quails were a rich food; and as they were rained down from heaven, so Christ is the bread of life which came down from heaven, and the bread he gave for the life of the world was his flesh: and as these came up, however the first quails, in the evening, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>, so Christ came in the flesh, in the evening or end of the world, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself; to which may be added, that these creatures sit upon their young, and cherish and protect them, as an hen her chickens (k) with which compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>, but seeing the quails are never called spiritual meat, as the manna is, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-3.htm">1 Corinthians 10:3</a>, but were given in wrath and judgment, they are rather an emblem of riches, or worldly goods, things given to carnal men; these are of God, as the quails were, and are by some persons enjoyed without care or trouble, as these were; their meat, as it is sometimes said, falls into their mouth, as these quails did into the mouths of the Israelites, as it were; and are in wrath, their blessings are cursed to them, and, while they have a great affluence of worldly things, have leanness in their souls, as the Israelites now had, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-15.htm">Psalm 106:15</a>, moreover, as these were feathered or winged fowl, so riches have wings, and sometimes flee away, and are very uncertain things to trust to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>. <p>(h)  "volucres alatas", Tigurine version, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius.

The (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>) very ancient Zoan (Tanis), ancient Egyptian Zane, Coptic G'ane, on the east bank of the Tanitic arm of the Nile, so called therefrom - according to the researches to which the Turin Papyrus No. 112 has led, identical with Avaris (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>)<p>(Note: The identity of Avaris and Tanis is in the meanwhile again become doubtful. Tanis was the Hyksos city, but Pelusium  equals  Avaris the Hyksos fortress; vid., Petermann's Mittheilungen, 1866, S. 296-298.)<p> - was the seat of the Hyksos dynasties that ruled in the eastern Delta, where after their overthrow Rameses II, the Pharaoh of the bondage, in order to propitiate the enraged mass of the Semitic population of Lower Egypt, embraced the worship of Baal instituted by King Apophis. The colossal sitting figure of Rameses II in the pillared court of the Royal Museum in Berlin, says Brugsch (Aus dem Orient ii. 45), is the figure which Rameses himself dedicated to the temple of Baal in Tanis and set up before its entrance. This mighty colossus is a contemporary of Moses, who certainly once looked upon this monument, when, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a> says, he "wrought wonders in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan." The psalmist, moreover, keeps very close to the Tra in his reproduction of the history of the Exodus, and in fact so close that he must have had it before him in the entirety of its several parts, the Deuteronomic, Elohimistic, and Jehovistic. Concerning the rule by which it is appointed &#8219;a&#772;'sa phe&#769;le, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>. The primary passage to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a> (cf. &#1504;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-16.htm">Psalm 78:16</a>) is <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>. &#1504;&#1491; is a pile, i.e., a piled up heap or mass, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a>. And <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-14.htm">Psalm 78:14</a> is the abbreviation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>. the writer condenses into one the two instances of the giving of water from the rock, in the first year of the Exodus (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>) and in the fortieth year (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>). The Piel &#1497;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506; and the plural &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; correspond to this compression. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; is not an adjective (after the analogy of &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;), but an adverb as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-3.htm">Psalm 62:3</a>; for the giving to drink needs a qualificative, but &#1514;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; does not need any enhancement. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; has &#305;&#770; instead of e&#772; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-43.htm">Psalm 105:43</a>.<p>The fact that the subject is continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17</a> with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; without mention having been made of any sinning on the part of the generation of the desert, is explicable from the consideration that the remembrance of that murmuring is closely connected with the giving of water from the rock to which the names Massah u-Mer&#305;&#770;bah and Mer&#305;&#770;bath-Kadesh (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>) point back: they went on (&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;) winning against Him, in spite of the miracles they experienced. &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is syncopated from &#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm">Isaiah 3:8</a>. The poet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-18.htm">Psalm 78:18</a> condenses the account of the manifestations of discontent which preceded the giving of the quails and manna (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>), and the second giving of quails (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>), as he has done the two cases of the giving of water from the rock in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>. They tempted God by unbelievingly and defiantly demanding (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, postulando, Ew. 280, d) instead of trustfully hoping and praying. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1501; points to the evil fountain of the heart, and &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; describes their longing as a sensual eagerness, a lusting after it. Instead of allowing the miracles hitherto wrought to work faith in them, they made the miracles themselves the starting-point of fresh doubts. The poet here clothes what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/21-5.htm">Psalm 21:5</a>, in a poetic dress. In &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; the unbelief reaches it climax, it sounds like self-irony. On the co-ordinating construction "therefore Jahve heard it and was wroth," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17</a>. The allusion is to the wrath-burning at Taberah (Tab'eera), <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>, which preceded the giving of the quails in the second year of the Exodus. For it is obvious that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a> coincide, &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; here being suggested by the &#1493;&#1514;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512;&#1470;&#1489;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; eht yb d of that passage, and &#1488;&#1507; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; being the opposite of &#1493;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1506; &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>. A conflagration broke out at that time in the camp, at the same time, however, with the breaking out of God's anger. The nexus between the anger and the fire is here an outward one, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a> it is an internal one. The ground upon which the wrathful decree is based, which is only hinted at there, is here more minutely given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-22.htm">Psalm 78:22</a> : they believed not in Elohim (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>), i.e., did not rest with believing confidence in Him, and trusted not in His salvation, viz., that which they had experienced in the redemption out of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>), and which was thereby guaranteed for time to come. Now, however, when Taberah is here followed first by the giving of the manna, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23-25</a>, then by the giving of the quails, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-26.htm">Psalm 78:26-29</a>, the course of the events is deranged, since the giving of the manna had preceded that burning, and it was only the giving of the quails that followed it. This putting together of the two givings out of order was rendered necessary by the preceding condensation (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-18.htm">Psalm 78:18-20</a>) of the clamorous desire for a more abundant supply of food before each of these events. Notwithstanding Israel's unbelief, He still remained faithful: He caused manna to rain down out of the opened gates of heaven (cf. "the windows of heaven," <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>), that is to say, in richest abundance. The manna is called corn (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a>, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>, it is called bread) of heaven, because it descended in the form of grains of corn, and supplied the place of bread-corn during the forty years. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the lxx correctly renders &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>). The manna is called "bread of angels" (Wisd. 16:20) as being bread from heaven (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a>), the dwelling-place of angels, as being mann es-sema&#770;, heaven's gift, its Arabic name, - a name which also belongs to the vegetable manna which flows out of the Tamarix mannifera in consequence of the puncture of the Coccus manniparus, and is even at the present day invaluable to the inhabitants of the desert of Sinai. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the antithesis to &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;; for if it signified "every one," &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; would have been said (Hitzig). &#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a>; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>. </body></html>
