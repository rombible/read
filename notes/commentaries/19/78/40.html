Let not those that receive mercy from God, be thereby made bold to sin, for the mercies they receive will hasten its punishment; yet let not those who are under Divine rebukes for sin, be discouraged from repentance. The Holy One of Israel will do what is most for his own glory, and what is most for their good. Their forgetting former favours, led them to limit God for the future. God made his own people to go forth like sheep; and guided them in the wilderness, as a shepherd his flock, with all care and tenderness. Thus the true Joshua, even Jesus, brings his church out of the wilderness; but no earthly Canaan, no worldly advantages, should make us forget that the church is in the wilderness while in this world, and that there remaineth a far more glorious rest for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness - Margin, Or, rebel against him. The Hebrew word may have the signification in the margin. The idea is, that they were perverse and rebellious; that they excited his displeasure, and gave occasion for his anger. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17</a>.<p>And grieve him in the desert - The word here rendered grieve means<p>(1) to work, to fashion;<p>(2) to suffer pain, to travail, to be afflicted; and then,<p>(3) to cause one to suffer pain, or to afflict.<p>The meaning here is that the conduct of the Hebrews was such as was suited to cause pain - as the conduct of a disobedient and rebellious child is. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/78.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40, 41.

Where they were not only at his mercy, having nothing to help themselves with, but had many singular mercies bestowed upon them; and yet were continually committing such sins against God as provoked the eyes of his glory; ten times they tempted him, the Lord says, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>, therefore that dispensation is called the provocation and day of temptation; for it was a series of rebellion and sin, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>, <p>and grieve him in the desert; which signifies the same as before, and is spoken after the manner of men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a> and like a tender parent grieved at the disobedience of his child, and that he is obliged to take the rod and chastise it. The prophet Isaiah says, they "vexed" or "grieved his Holy Spirit", <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>, the same word is there used as here; compare with it <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/78.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/78.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">40, 41</span>.

That God is "grieved" at man's sins appears, not only from this passage, but also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-10.htm">Psalm 95:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-17.htm">Hebrews 3:17</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/78.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Passing over to the giving of the quails, the poet is thinking chiefly of the first occasion mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>, which directly preceded the giving of the manna. But the description follows the second: &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506; (He caused to depart, set out) after <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>. "East" and "south" belong together: it was a south-east wind from the Aelanitic Gulf. "To rain down" is a figurative expression for a plentiful giving of dispensing from above. "Its camp, its tents," are those of Israel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>. The &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492;, occurring twice, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-29.htm">Psalm 78:29-30</a> (of the object of strong desire, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>), points to Kibroth-hattaavah, the scene of this carnal lusting; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; is the transitive of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-30.htm">Psalm 78:30-31</a> even in the construction the poet closely follows <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a> (cf. also &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; with &#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1488;, aversion, loathing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-20.htm">Numbers 11:20</a>). The Waw unites what takes place simultaneously; a construction which presents the advantage of being able to give special prominence to the subject. The wrath of God consisted in the breaking out of a sickness which was the result of immoderate indulgence, and to which even the best-nourished and most youthfully vigorous fell a prey. When the poet goes on in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a> to say that in spite of these visitations (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;) they went on sinning, he has chiefly before his mind the outbreak of "fat" rebelliousness after the return of the spies, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-32.htm">Psalm 78:32</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>. And <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-33.htm">Psalm 78:33</a> refers to the judgment of death in the wilderness threatened at that time to all who had come out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28-34</a>). Their life devoted to death vanished from that time onwards &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, in breath-like instability, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;, in undurable precipitancy; the mode of expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-1.htm">Job 36:1</a> suggests to the poet an expressive play of words. When now a special judgment suddenly and violently thinned the generation that otherwise was dying off, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>., then they inquired after Him, they again sought His favour, those who were still preserved in the midst of this dying again remembered the God who had proved Himself to be a "Rock" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>) and to be a "Redeemer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>) to them. And what next? <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-36.htm">Psalm 78:36-37</a><p>(Note: According to the reckoning of the Masora this <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-36.htm">Psalm 78:36</a> is the middle verse of the 2527 verses of the Psalter (Buxtorf, Tiberias, 1620, p. 133).)<p>tell us what effect they gave to this disposition to return to God. They appeased Him with their mouth, is meant to say: they sought to win Him over to themselves by fair speeches, inasmuch as they thus anthropopathically conceived of God, and with their tongue they played the hypocrite to Him; their heart, however, was not sincere towards Him (&#1506;&#1501; like &#1488;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>), i.e., not directed straight towards Him, and they proved themselves not stedfast (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, or properly &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;) in their covenant-relationship to Him. </body></html>
