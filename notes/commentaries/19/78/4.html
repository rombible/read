The law of God was given with a particular charge to teach it diligently to their children, that the church may abide for ever. Also, that the providences of God, both in mercy and in judgment, might encourage them to conform to the will of God. The works of God much strengthen our resolution to keep his commandments. Hypocrisy is the high road to apostacy; those that do not set their hearts right, will not be stedfast with God. Many parents, by negligence and wickedness, become murderers of their children. But young persons, though they are bound to submit in all things lawful, must not obey sinful orders, or copy sinful examples.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We will not hide them from their children - From their descendants, however remote.

This is the duty of each successive generation in the world, receiving, as a trust, from past generations, the result of their thoughts, their experience, their wisdom, their inventions, their arts, their sciences, and the records of their doings, to hand these down unimpaired to future ages, combined with all that they may themselves invent or discover which may be of use or advantage to the generations following.<p>Shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord - The "reasons" why he should be praised, as resulting from his past doings - and the wags in which it should be done.

There now follow in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a> lines taken from the picture of a thunder-storm. The poet wishes to describe how all the powers of nature became the servants of the majestic revelation of Jahve, when He executed judgment on Egypt and delivered Israel. &#1494;&#1512;&#1501;, Poel of &#1494;&#1512;&#1501; (cognate &#1494;&#1512;&#1489;, &#1494;&#1512;&#1507;, Aethiopic &#1494;&#1504;&#1501;, to rain), signifies intensively: to stream forth in full torrents. Instead of this line, Habakkuk, with a change of the letters of the primary passage, which is usual in Jeremiah more especially, has &#1494;&#1512;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;. The rumbling which the &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;<p>(Note: We have indicated on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>, that the &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; are so called from their thinness, but passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a> and the one before us do not favour this idea. One would think that we have more likely to go back to Arab. sh&#803;q, to be distant (whence suh&#803;k&#803;, distance; sah&#803;&#305;&#770;k&#803;, distant), and that &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; signifies the distances, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the heights, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;  equals  suh&#803;k&#803;, in distinction from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, an atom (Wetzstein). But the Hebrew affords no trace of this verbal stem, whereas &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, Arab. sh&#803;q, contundere, comminuere (Neshwn: to pound to dust, used e.g., of the apothecary's drugs), is just as much Hebrew as Arabic. And the word is actually associated with this verb by the Arabic mind, inasmuch as Arab. sah&#803;a&#770;bun sah&#803;qun (nubes tenues, nubila tenuia) is explained by Arab. sh&#803;a&#770;b rq&#305;&#770;q. Accordingly &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, according to its primary notion, signifies that which spreads itself out thin and fine over a wide surface, and according to the usage of the language, in contrast with the thick and heavy &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the uppermost stratum of the atmosphere, and then the clouds, as also Arab. a&#8219;na&#770;n, and the collective &#8219;anan and &#8219;ana&#770;n (vid., Isaiah, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>, note), is not first of all the clouds, but the surface of the sky that is turned to us (Fleischer).)<p>cause to sound forth (&#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm">Psalm 68:34</a>) is the thunder. The arrows of God (&#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1497;&#1498;, in Habakkuk &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;) are the lightnings. The Hithpa. (instead of which Habakkuk has &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;) depicts their busy darting hither and thither in the service of the omnipotence that sends them forth. It is open to question whether &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; denotes the roll of the thunder (Aben-Ezra, Maurer, Bttcher): the sound of Thy thunder went rolling forth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a>), - or the whirlwind accompanying the thunder-storm (Hitzig); the usage of the language (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/83-14.htm">Psalm 83:14</a>, also <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-13.htm">Ezekiel 10:13</a>, Syriac golgolo) is in favour of the latter. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a> cf. the echo in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-4.htm">Psalm 97:4</a>. Amidst such commotions in nature above and below Jahve strode along through the sea, and made a passage for His redeemed. His person and His working were invisible, but the result which attested His active presence was visible. He took His way through the sea, and cut His path (Chethb plural, &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15</a>) through great waters (or, according to Habakkuk, caused His horses to go through), without the footprints (&#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; with Dag. dirimens) of Him who passes and passed through being left behind to show it. </body></html>
