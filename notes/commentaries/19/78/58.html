God gave them his testimonies, but they turned back. Presumptuous sins render even Israelites hateful to God's holiness, and exposed to his justice. Those whom the Lord forsakes become an easy prey to the destroyer. And sooner or later, God will disgrace his enemies. He set a good government over his people; a monarch after his own heart. With good reason does the psalmist make this finishing, crowning instance of God's favour to Israel; for David was a type of Christ, the great and good Shepherd, who was humbled first, and then exalted; and of whom it was foretold, that he should be filled with the Spirit of wisdom and understanding. On the uprightness of his heart, and the skilfulness of his hands, all his subjects may rely; and of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. Every trial of human nature hitherto, confirms the testimony of Scripture, that the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, and nothing but being created anew by the Holy Ghost can cure the ungodliness of any.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For they provoked him to anger with their high places - places where idols were worshipped; usually on mountains or elevated places. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-32.htm">2 Kings 17:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-17.htm">2 Chronicles 33:17</a>.<p>And moved him to jealousy - As one is when affections due to himself are bestowed upon another - as in the married life.

The poet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49-51</a> brings the fifth Egyptian plague, the pestilence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1-7</a>), and the tenth and last, the smiting of the first-born (&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1</a>, together. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a> sounds like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm">Job 20:23</a> (cf. below <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a>). &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are not wicked angels, against which view Hengstenberg refers to the scriptural thesis of Jacobus Ode in his work De Angelis, Deum ad puniendos malos homines mittere bonos angelos et ad castigandos pios usurpare malos, but angels that bring misfortune. The mode of construction belongs to the chapter of the genitival subordination of the adjective to the substantive, like &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-18.htm">Numbers 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-24.htm">Numbers 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>, and the Arabic msjdu 'l-ja&#770;m&#8219;, the mosque of the assembling one, i.e., the assembling (congregational) mosque, therefore: angels (not of the wicked ones  equals  wicked angels, which it might signify elsewhere, but) of the evil ones  equals  evil, misfortune-bringing angels (Ew. &#1431;287, a). The poet thus paraphrases the &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; that is collectively conceived in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a> the anger is conceived of as a stream of fire, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a> death as an executioner, and in 50c the pestilence as a foe. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>) is that which had sprung for the first time from manly vigour (plur. intensivus). Egypt is called &#1495;&#1501; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1-10</a> according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>, and is also called by themselves in ancient Egyptian Kemi, Coptic Chmi, Kme (vid., Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride, ch. 33). When now these plagues which softened their Pharaoh went forth upon the Egyptians, God procured for His people a free departure, He guided flock-like (&#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1512; like &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-24.htm">Jeremiah 31:24</a>, with Dag. implicitum), i.e., as a shepherd, the flock of His people (the favourite figure of the Psalms of Asaph) through the desert, - He led them safely, removing all terrors out of the way and drowning their enemies in the Red Sea, to His holy territory, to the mountain which (&#1494;&#1492;) His right hand had acquired, or according to the accents (cf. supra, p. 104): to the mountain there (&#1494;&#1492;), which, etc. It is not Zion that is meant, but, as in the primary passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>., in accordance with the parallelism (although this is not imperative) and the usage of the language, which according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>, is incontrovertible, the whole of the Holy Land with its mountains and valleys (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:11</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; is the poetical equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a>, and frequently. The Beth is Beth essentiae (here in the same syntactical position as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a>, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a> surely): He made them (the heathen, viz., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-4.htm">Joshua 23:4</a> their territories) fall to them (viz., as the expression implies, by lot, &#1489;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500;) as a line of inheritance, i.e., (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>) as a portion measured out as an inheritance. It is only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a> (and not so early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>) that the narration passes over to the apostate conduct of the children of the generation of the desert, that is to say, of the Israel of Canaan. Instead of &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; from &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, the word here is &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; from &#1506;&#1491;&#1492; (a derivative of &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, not &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;). Since the apostasy did not gain ground until after the death of Joshua and Eleazar, it is the Israel of the period of the Judges that we are to think of here. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a>, is not: a bow of slackness, but: a bow of deceit; for the point of comparison, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/7-16.htm">Hosea 7:16</a>, is its missing the mark: a bow that discharges its arrow in a wrong direction, that makes no sure shot. The verb &#1512;&#1502;&#1492; signifies not only to allow to hang down slack (cogn. &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;), but also, according to a similar conception to spe dejicere, to disappoint, deny. In the very act of turning towards God, or at least being inclined towards Him by His tokens of power and loving-kindness, they turned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>) like a vow that misses the mark and disappoints both aim and expectation. The expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a> is like <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; refers to their prayer to the Ba(a4lim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>). The word &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, which occurs three times in this Psalm, is a word belonging to Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-26.htm">Deuteronomy 3:26</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-59.htm">Psalm 78:59</a> is purposely worded exactly like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-21.htm">Psalm 78:21</a>. The divine purpose of love spurned by the children just as by the fathers, was obliged in this case, as in the former, to pass over into angry provocation. </body></html>
