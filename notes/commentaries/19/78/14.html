Sin dispirits men, and takes away the heart. Forgetfulness of God's works is the cause of disobedience to his laws. This narrative relates a struggle between God's goodness and man's badness. The Lord hears all our murmurings and distrusts, and is much displeased. Those that will not believe the power of God's mercy, shall feel the fire of his indignation. Those cannot be said to trust in God's salvation as their happiness at last, who can not trust his providence in the way to it. To all that by faith and prayer, ask, seek, and knock, these doors of heaven shall at any time be opened; and our distrust of God is a great aggravation of our sins. He expressed his resentment of their provocation; not in denying what they sinfully lusted after, but in granting it to them. Lust is contented with nothing. Those that indulge their lust, will never be estranged from it. Those hearts are hard indeed, that will neither be melted by the mercies of the Lord, nor broken by his judgments. Those that sin still, must expect to be in trouble still. And the reason why we live with so little comfort, and to so little purpose, is, because we do not live by faith. Under these rebukes they professed repentance, but they were not sincere, for they were not constant. In Israel's history we have a picture of our own hearts and lives. God's patience, and warnings, and mercies, imbolden them to harden their hearts against his word. And the history of kingdoms is much the same. Judgments and mercies have been little attended to, until the measure of their sins has been full. And higher advantages have not kept churches from declining from the commandments of God. Even true believers recollect, that for many a year they abused the kindness of Providence. When they come to heaven, how will they admire the Lord's patience and mercy in bringing them to his kingdom!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/78.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the day-time also he led them with a cloud - That is, the cloud was the visible symbol of his presence, and its movements determined the way in which they were to go. It was "God" who led them, and who adopted this manner of doing it, so that they had "always" with them, by day and by night, a "visible" proof of his presence. There was that with them which could not be ascribed to any natural causes, and which, therefore, "demonstrated" that God was with them, and that as long as they followed the cloud and the pillar of fire they could not err. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>. They had the less excuse, therefore, for rebelling against him.<p>And all the night with a light of fire - A column - a pillar - which stood over the camp, and which was a symbol of the divine presence and guidance. The cloud would not be visible by night, nor would the fire be a good guide by day; and hence, the form of the symbol was changed. The same thing, however, was intended by both, and together they were standing proofs of the presence of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/78.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-14.

He comes forward among the people as a preacher, and demands for his tra a willing, attentive hearing. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is the word for every human doctrine or instruction, especially for the prophetic discourse which sets forth and propagates the substance of the divine teaching. Asaph is a prophet, hence <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a> is quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34</a>. as &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;.<p>(Note: The reading &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x397;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; is, although erroneous, nevertheless ancient; since even the Clementine Homilies introduce this passage as the language of Isaiah.)<p>He here recounts to the people their history &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, from that Egyptaeo-Sinaitic age of yore to which Israel's national independence and specific position in relation to the rest of the world goes back. It is not, however, with the external aspect of the history that he has to do, but with its internal teachings. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; is an allegory or parable, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;, more particularly the apophthegm as the characteristic species of poetry belonging to the Chokma, and then in general a discourse of an elevated style, full of figures, thoughtful, pithy, and rounded. &#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492; is that which is entangled, knotted, involved, perlexe dictum. The poet, however, does not mean to say that he will literally discourse gnomic sentences and propound riddles, but that he will set forth the history of the fathers after the manner of a parable and riddle, so that it may become as a parable, i.e., a didactic history, and its events as marks of interrogation and nota-bene's to the present age. The lxx renders thus: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;. Instead of this the Gospel by Matthew has: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), and recognises in this language of the Psalm a prophecy of Christ; because it is moulded so appropriately for the mouth of Him who is the Fulfiller not only of the Law and of Prophecy, but also of the vocation of the prophet. It is the object-clause to &#1504;&#1499;&#1495;&#1491;, and not a relative clause belonging to the "riddles out of the age of yore," that follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3</a> with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, for that which has been heard only becomes riddles by the appropriation and turn the poet gives to it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3</a> begins a new period (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-1.htm">Jeremiah 14:1</a>, and frequently): What we have heard, and in consequence thereof known, and what our fathers have told us (word for word, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-13.htm">Judges 6:13</a>), that will we not hide from their children (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-18.htm">Job 15:18</a>). The accentuation is perfectly correct. The Reb&#305;&#770;a by &#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; has a greater distinctive force than the Reb&#305;&#770;a by &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;); it is therefore to be rendered: telling to the later generation (which is just what is intended by the offspring of the fathers) the glorious deeds of Jahve, etc. The fut. consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; joins on to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;. Glorious deeds, proofs of power, miracles hath He wrought, and in connection therewith set up an admonition in Jacob, and laid down an order in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, viz., to propagate by tradition the remembrance of those mighty deeds (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-8.htm">Exodus 13:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>, and other passages). &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1501; has the same object as &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-22.htm">Joshua 4:22</a>. The matter in question is not the giving of the Law in general, as the purpose of which, the keeping of the laws, ought then to have been mentioned before anything else, but a precept, the purpose of which was the further proclamation of the magnalia Dei, and indirectly the promotion of trust in god and fidelity to the Law; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-5.htm">Psalm 81:5</a>., where the special precept concerning the celebration of the Feast of the Passover is described as a &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; laid down in Joseph. The following generation, the children, which shall be born in the course of the ages, were to know concerning His deeds, and also themselves to rise up (&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, not: come into being, like the &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; of the older model-passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>) and to tell them further to their children, in order that these might place their confidence in god (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-28.htm">Psalm 73:28</a>), and might not forget the mighty deeds of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a>), and might keep His commandments, being warned by the disobedience of the fathers. The generation of the latter is called &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, just as the degenerate son that is to be stoned is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, to direct one's heart, i.e., to give it the right direction or tendency, to put it into the right state, is to be understood after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>, Sir. 2:17.</body></html>
