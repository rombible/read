This Psalm appears to have been occasioned by the removal of the sanctuary from Shiloh in the tribe of Ephraim to Zion in the tribe of Judah, and the coincident transfer of pre-eminence in Israel from the former to the latter tribe, as clearly evinced by David's settlement as the head of the Church and nation. Though this was the execution of God's purpose, the writer here shows that it also proceeded from the divine judgment on Ephraim, under whose leadership the people had manifested the same sinful and rebellious character which had distinguished their ancestors in Egypt.<p>1. my people &#8230; my law&#8212;the language of a religious teacher (Ps 78:2; La 3:14; Ro 2:16, 27; compare Ps 49:4).

The inspired bard calls on his countrymen to give heed to his patriotic teaching. We naturally expect God's chosen nation to be first in hearkening to his voice. When God gives his truth a tongue, and sends forth his messengers trained to declare his word with power, it is the least we can do to give them our ears and the earnest obedience of our hearts. Shall God speak, and his children refuse to hear? His teaching has the force of law, let us yield both ear and heart to it. "Incline your ears to the words of my mouth." Give earnest attention, bow your stiff necks, lean forward to catch every syllable. We are at this day, as readers of the sacred records, bound to study them deeply, exploring their meaning, and labouring to practise their teaching. As the officer of an army commences his drill by calling for "Attention," even so every trained soldier of Christ is called upon to give ear to his words. Men lend their ears to music, how much more then should they listen to the harmonies of the gospel; they sit enthralled in the presence of an orator, how much rather should they yield to the eloquence of heaven.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a><p>"I will open my mouth in a parable." Analogies are not only to be imagined, but are intended by God to be traced between the story of Israel and the lives of believers. Israel was ordained to be a type; the tribes and their marchings are living allegories traced by the hand of an all-wise providence. Unspiritual persons may sneer about fancies and mysticisms, but Paul spake well when he said "which things are an allegory," and Asaph in the present case spake to the point when he called his narrative "a parable." That such was his meaning is clear from the quotation, "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world." - <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-35.htm">Matthew 13:35</a>. "I will utter dark sayings of old;" - enigmas of antiquity, riddles of yore. The mind of the poet-prophet was so full of ancient lore that he poured it forth in a copious stream of song, while beneath the gushing flood lay pearls and gems of spiritual truth, capable of enriching those who could dive into the depths and bring them up. The letter of this song is precious, but the inner sense is beyond all price. Whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a> called for attention, the second justifies the demand by hinting that the outer sense conceals an inner and hidden meaning, which only the thoughtful will be able to perceive.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3</a><p>"Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us." Tradition was of the utmost service to the people of God in the olden time, before the more sure word of prophecy had become complete and generally accessible. The receipt of truth from the lips of others laid the instructed believer under solemn obligation to pass on the truth to the next generation. Truth, endeared to us by its fond associations with godly parents and venerable friends, deserves of us our best exertions to preserve and propagate it. Our fathers told us, we heard them, and we know personally what they taught; it remains for us in our turn to hand it on. Blessed be God we have now the less mutable testimony of written revelation, but this by no means lessens our obligation to instruct our children in divine truth by word of mouth: rather, with such a gracious help, we ought to teach them far more fully the things of God. Dr. Doddridge owed much to the Dutch tiles and his mother's explanations of the Bible narratives. The more of parental teaching the better; ministers and Sabbath-school teachers were never meant to be substitutes for mothers' tears and fathers' prayers.<p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The scope of this Psalm is plainly expressed <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-6.htm" title="That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:...">Psalm 78:6-8</a></span>, and is this, that the Israelites might learn to hope and trust in God, and steadfastly to keep his laws and covenant; which great lesson he presseth upon them, from the sad effects of the contrary practices in their forefathers, of which he gives a brief yet full account in a recapitulation of he most remarkable passages in the history of their church and nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An exhortation to attend to and instruct others in the word and works of the Lord, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-1.htm" title="Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth....">Psalm 78:1-8</a></span>.

In the rendering of &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; (with the tone regularly drawn back before the following monosyllable) even the Targum wavers between &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (my affliction) and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (my supplication); and just in the same way, in the rendering of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>, between &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; (have changed) and &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (years). &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; cannot possibly signify "change" in an active sense, as Luther renders: "The right hand of the Most High can change everything," but only a having become different (lxx and the Quinta &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), after which Maurer, Hupfeld, and Hitzig render thus: my affliction is this, that the right hand of the Most High has changed. But after we have read &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-6.htm">Psalm 77:6</a> as a poetical plural of &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, a year, we have first of all to see whether it may not have the same signification here. And many possible interpretations present themselves. It can be interpreted: "my supplication is this: years of the right hand of the Most High" (viz., that years like to the former ones may be renewed); but this thought is not suited to the introduction with &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. We must either interpret it: my sickness, viz., from the side of God, i.e., the temptation which befalls me from Him, the affliction ordained by Him for me (Aquila &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), is this (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a>); or, since in this case the unambiguous &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; would have been used instead of the Piel: my being pierced, my wounding, my sorrow is this (Symmachus &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, inf.

In connection with this way of taking <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> is now suitably and easily attached to what has gone before. The poet says to himself that the affliction allotted to him has its time, and will not last for ever. Therein lies a hope which makes the retrospective glance into the happier past a source of consolation to him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> the Chethb &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512; is to be retained, for the &#1499;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a> is thus best explained: "I bring to remembrance, i.e., make known with praise or celebrate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>), the deeds of Ja&#772;h, for I will remember Thy wondrous doing from days of old." His sorrow over the distance between the present and the past is now mitigated by the hope that God's right hand, which now casts down, will also again in His own time raise up. Therefore he will now, as the advance from the indicative to the cohortative (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>) imports, thoroughly console and refresh himself with God's work of salvation in all its miraculous manifestations from the earliest times. &#1497;&#1492;&#1468; is the most concise and comprehensive appellation for the God of the history of redemption, who, as Habakkuk prays, will revive His work of redemption in the midst of the years to come, and bring it to a glorious issue. To Him who then was and who will yet come the poet now brings praise and celebration. The way of God is His historical rule, and more especially, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;, His redemptive rule. The primary passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm">Psalm 68:25</a>) shows that &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is not to be rendered "in the sanctuary" (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;), but "in holiness" (Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;). Holy and glorious in love and in anger. God goes through history, and shows Himself there as the incomparable One, with whose greatness no being, and least of all any one of the beingless gods, can be measured. He is &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, the God, God absolutely and exclusively, a miracle-working (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;, not &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1488; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>)<p>(Note: The joining of the second word, accented on the first syllable and closely allied in sense, on to the first, which is accented on the ultima (the tone of which, under certain circumstances, retreats to the penult., &#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;) or monosyllabic, by means of the hardening Dagesh (the so-called &#1491;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;), only takes place when that first word ends in  &#1492;- or  &#1492;-, not when it ends in  &#1492;-.))<p>God, and a God who by these very means reveals Himself as the living and supra-mundane God. He has made His omnipotence known among the peoples, viz., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> says, by the redemption of His people, the tribes of Jacob and the double tribe of Joseph, out of Egypt, - a deed of His arm, i.e., the work of His own might, by which He has proved Himself to all peoples and to the whole earth to be the Lord of the world and the God of salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;, brachio scil. extenso (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>, and frequently), just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, collo scil. erecto. The music here strikes in; the whole strophe is an overture to the following hymn in celebration of God, the Redeemer out of Egypt. </body></html>
