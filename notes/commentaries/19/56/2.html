In many passages where it is used the meaning given here by the LXX., “trample on,” will suit the context quite as well as, or even better than, the meaning, “pant after,” given in the Lexicons. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm" title="Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallows up their substance.">Job 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-14.htm" title="I have long time held my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.">Isaiah 42:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-5.htm" title="The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to his place where he arose.">Ecclesiastes 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm" title="That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in to the same maid, to profane my holy name:">Amos 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-4.htm" title="Hear this, O you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,">Amos 8:4</a>.) And this sense of bruising by trampling also suits the cognate verb, <span class= "ital">shûph, </span>used only three times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm" title="For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.">Job 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-11.htm" title="If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.">Psalm 139:11</a>). Symmachus also here has “bruise,” or “grind.” On the other hand in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-131.htm" title="I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for your commandments.">Psalm 119:131</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-2.htm" title="As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as an hireling looks for the reward of his work:">Job 7:2</a>, &c, we want the idea of “haste” or “desire.” Possibly the original meaning of “trample” may have passed through the sense of physical haste to that of passion. Or we may even get the sense of “greedily devouring” by the exactly similar process by which we come to talk of devouring the road with speed. The same verb is used in the next verse with an object.<p><span class= "bld">Fighting.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">devouring. </span>(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-1.htm" title="Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.">Psalm 35:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">O thou most High.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">marôm, </span>which is here not a vocative, but an adverbial accusative, “proudly,” in pride.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/56.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>56:1-7 Be merciful unto me, O God. This petition includes all the good for which we come to throne of grace. If we obtain mercy there, we need no more to make us happy. It implies likewise our best plea, not our merit, but God's mercy, his free, rich mercy. We may flee to, and trust the mercy of God, when surrounded on all sides by difficulties and dangers. His enemies were too hard for him, if God did not help him. He resolves to make God's promises the matter of his praises, and so we have reason to make them. As we must not trust an arm of flesh when engaged for us, so we must not be afraid of an arm of flesh when stretched out against us. The sin of sinners will never be their security. Who knows the power of God's anger; how high it can reach, how forcibly it can strike?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/56.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mine enemies - Margin, "mine observers." The Hebrew word here used means properly to twist, to twist totogether; then, to be firm, hard, tough; then, "to press together," as a rope that is twisted - and hence, the idea of oppressing, or pressing hard on one, as an enemy. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm">Psalm 54:5</a>. In the former verse the psalmist spoke of an enemy, or of "one" that would swallow him up (in the singular number), or of "man" as an enemy to him anywhere. Here he uses the plural number, implying that there were "many" who were enlisted against him. He was surrounded by enemies. He met them wherever he went. He had an enemy in Saul; he had enemies in the followers of Saul; he had enemies among the Philistines, and now when he had fled to Achish, king of Gath, and had hoped to find a refuge and a friend there, he found only bitter foes.<p>Would daily swallow me up - Constantly; their efforts to do it are unceasing. A new day brings no relief to me, but every day I am called to meet some new form of opposition.<p>For they be many that fight against me - His own followers and friends were few; his foes were many. Saul had numerous followers, and David encountered foes wherever he went. "O thou Most High." The word used here - &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;  ma&#770;ro&#770;m - means properly height, altitude, elevation; then, a high place, especially heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-16.htm">Psalm 18:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>; then it is applied to anything high or inaccessible, as a fortress, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a>. It is supposed by Gesenius (Lexicon), and some others, to mean here "elation of mind, pride," - implying that his enemies fought against him with elated minds, or proudly. So the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and Luther render it; and so DeWette understands it. Yet it seems most probable that our translators have given the correct rendering, and that the passage is a solemn appeal to God as more exalted than his foes, and as one, therefore, in whom he could put entire confidence.

The relative clause at the same time gives the ground for this their fate from the character they bear: they persevere in their course without any regard to any other in their godlessness. The noun &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, which is used elsewhere of a change of clothes, of a reserve in time of war, of a relief of bands of workmen, here signifies a change of mind (Targum), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a> a change of condition; the plural means that every change of this kind is very far from them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a> David again has the one faithless foe among the multitude of the rebels before his mind. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-21.htm">Genesis 34:21</a>, those who stood in peaceful relationship to him (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>). David classes himself with his faithful adherents. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; is here a defensive and offensive treaty of mutual fidelity entered into in the presence of God. By &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; and &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; is meant the intention which, though not carried out as yet, is already in itself a violation and profanation of the solemn compact. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a> the description passes into the tone of the caesural schema. It is impossible for &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, so far as the vowels are concerned, to be equivalent to &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, since this change of the vowels would obliterate the preposition; but one is forbidden to read &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (Targum, Symmachus, Jerome) by the fact that &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>) cannot be the subject to &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;. Consequently &#1502; belongs to the noun itself, and the denominative &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;), like &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1506;&#1491;&#1503;), dainties, signifies articles of food prepared from curdled milk; here it is used figuratively of "milk-words" or "butter-words" which come from the lips of the hypocrite softly, sweetly, and supplely as cream: os nectar promit, mens aconita vomit. In the following words &#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) the Makkeph (in connection with which it would have to be read ukerob just the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm">Psalm 55:19</a>, since the - has not a Metheg) is to be crossed out (as in fact it is even wanting here and there in MSS and printed editions). The words are an independent substantival clause: war (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;, a pushing together, assault, battle, after the form &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; mrof eh with an unchangeable a&#770;) is his inward part and his words are swords; these two clauses correspond. &#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (properly like Arab. rkk, to be thin, weak, then also: to be soft, mild; root &#1512;&#1498;, &#1512;&#1511;, tendere, tenuare) has the accent on the ultima, vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-20.htm">Psalm 38:20</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; is a drawn, unsheathed sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-14.htm">Psalm 37:14</a>).<p>The exhortation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>, which begins a new strophe and is thereby less abrupt, is first of all a counsel which David gives to himself, but at the same time to all who suffer innocently, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>. Instead of the obscure &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;. &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;, we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a> &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a> &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1498;, according to which the word is not a verb after the form &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1498; (Chajug', Gecatilia, and Kimchi), but an accusative of the object (just as it is in fact accented; for the Legarme of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; has a lesser disjunctive value than the Zinnor of &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;). The lxx renders it &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. Thus are these words of the Psalm applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>. According to the Talmud &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; (the same form as &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) signifies a burden. "One day," relates Rabba bar-Chana, B. Rosh ha-Shana, 26b, and elsewhere, "I was walking with an Arabian (Nabataean?) tradesman, and happened to be carrying a heavy pack. And he said to me, &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1497;&#1500; &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1490;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;, Take thy burden and throw it on my camel." Hence it is wiser to refer &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; to &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;, to give, apportion, than to a stem &#1497;&#1492;&#1489;  equals  &#1497;&#1488;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-131.htm">Psalm 119:131</a> (root &#1488;&#1489;, &#1488;&#1493;), to desire; so that it consequently does not mean desiring, longing, care, but that which is imposed, laid upon one, assigned or allotted to one (Bttcher), in which sense the Chaldee derivatives of &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; (Targum <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>, for &#1502;&#1504;&#1514;) do actually occur. On whomsoever one casts what is allotted to him to carry, to him one gives it to carry. The admonition proceeds on the principle that God is as willing as He is able to bear even the heaviest burden for us; but this bearing it for us is on the other side our own bearing of it in God's strength, and hence the promise that is added runs: He will sustain thee (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;), that thou mayest not through feebleness succumb. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a> also favours this figure of a burden: He will not give, i.e., suffer to happen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-66.htm">Psalm 78:66</a>), tottering to the righteous for ever, He will never suffer the righteous to totter. The righteous shall never totter (or be moved) with the overthrow that follows; whereas David is sure of this, that his enemies shall not only fall to the ground, but go down into Hades (which is here, by a combination of two synonyms, &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, called a well, i.e., an opening, of a sinking in, i.e., a pit, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-31.htm">Proverbs 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>), and that before they have halved their days, i.e., before they have reached the half of the age that might be attained under other circumstances (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11</a>). By &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; prominence is given to the fact that it is the very same God who will not suffer the righteous to fall who casts down the ungodly; and by &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; David contrasts himself with them, as being of good courage now and in all time to come. </body></html>
