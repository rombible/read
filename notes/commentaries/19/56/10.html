Yet we are often tempted to repine and despond under small sorrows. For this we should check ourselves. David comforts himself, in his distress and fear, that God noticed all his grievances and all his griefs. God has a bottle and a book for his people's tears, both the tears for their sins, and those for their afflictions. He observes them with tender concern. Every true believer may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and then I will not fear what man shall do unto me; for man has no power but what is given him from above. Thy vows are upon me, O Lord; not as a burden, but as that by which I am known to be thy servant; as a bridle that restrains me from what would be hurtful, and directs me in the way of my duty. And vows of thankfulness properly accompany prayers for mercy. If God deliver us from sin, either from doing it, or by his pardoning mercy, he has delivered our souls from death, which is the wages of sin. Where the Lord has begun a good work he will carry it on and perfect it. David hopes that God would keep him even from the appearance of sin. We should aim in all our desires and expectations of deliverance, both from sin and trouble, that we may do the better service to the Lord; that we may serve him without fear. If his grace has delivered our souls from the death of sin, he will bring us to heaven, to walk before him for ever in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/56.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In God will I praise his word - Luther renders this, "I will praise the word of God." The phrase "in God" means probably "in respect to God;" or, "in what pertains to God." That which he would "particularly" praise or celebrate in respect to God - that which called for the most decided expressions of praise and gratitude, was his "word," his promise, his revealed truth. So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/138-2.htm">Psalm 138:2</a>, "Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name;" that is, above all the other manifestations of thyself. The allusion in the passage here is to what God had "spoken" to David, or the "promise" which he had made - the declaration of his gracious purposes in regard to him. Amidst all the perfections of Deity, and all which God had done for him, this now seemed to him to have special pre-eminence in his praises. The "word" of God was to him that which impressed his mind most deeply - that which most tenderly affected his heart. There are times when we feel this, and properly feel it; times when, in the contemplation of the divine perfections and dealings, our minds so rest on his word, on his truth, on what he has revealed, on his gracious promises, on the disclosures of a plan of redemption, on the assurance of a heaven hereafter, on the instructions which he has given us about himself and his plans - about ourselves, our duty, and our prospects, that this absorbs all our thoughts, and we feel that this is "the" great blessing for which we are to be thankful; this, "the" great mercy for which we are to praise him. What would the life of man be without the Bible! What a dark, gloomy, sad course would ours be on earth if we had nothing to guide us to a better world!<p>In the Lord will I praise his word - In "Yahweh." That is, whether I contemplate God in the usual name by which he is known - &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'Elohiym - or by that more sacred name which he has assumed - &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  Yahweh - that which seems now to me to lay the foundation of loftiest praise and most hearty thanksgiving, is that he has spoken to people, and made known his will in his revealed truth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/56.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. God is for me&#8212;or, "on my side" (Ps 118:6; 124:1, 2); hence he is sure of the repulse of his foes.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/56.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>10 In God will I praise his word: in the Lord will I praise his word.<p>11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.<p>12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.<p>13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I way walk before God in the light of the living?<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-10.htm">Psalm 56:10</a><p>"In God will I praise his word." Now comes the thanksgiving. He is a wretch who, having obtained help, forgets to return a grateful acknowledgment. The least we can do is to praise him from whom we receive such distinguished favours. Does David here mean "by God's grace I will praise him?" If so, he shows us that all our emotions towards God must be in God, produced by him and presented as such. Or does he mean, "that which in God is most the object of my praise is his word, and the faithfulness with which he keeps it?" If so, we see how attached our hearts should be to the sure word of promise, and especially to him who is the Word incarnate. The Lord is to be praised under every aspect, and in all his attributes and acts, but certain mercies more peculiarly draw out our admiration towards special portions of the great whole. That praise which is never special in its direction cannot be very thoughtful, and it is to be feared cannot be very acceptable. "In the Lord will I praise his word." He delights to dwell on his praise, he therefore repeats his song. The change by which he brings in the glorious name of Jehovah is doubtless meant to indicate that under every aspect he delights in his God and in his word.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a><p>"In God have I put my trust." This and the former verse are evidently the chorus of the Psalm. We cannot be too careful of our faith, or see too sedulously that it is grounded on the Lord alone. "I will not be afraid what man can do unto me." Faith has banished fear. He views his foes in their most forcible character, calling them not flesh, but indicating them as man, yet he dreads them not; though the whole race were his enemies he would not be afraid now that his trust is stayed on God. He is not afraid of what they threaten to do, for much of that they cannot do; and even what is in their power, what they can do, he defies with holy daring. He speaks for the future, "I will not," for he is sure that the security of the present will suffice for days to come.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm">Psalm 56:12</a><p>"Thy vows are upon me, O God." Vows made in his trouble he does not lightly forget, nor should we. We voluntarily made them, let us cheerfully keep them. All professed Christians are men under vows, but especially those who in hours of dire distress have re-dedicated themselves unto the Lord. "I will render praises unto thee." With heart, and voice, and gift, we should cheerfully extol the God of our salvation. The practice of making solemn vows in times of trouble is to be commended, when it is followed by the far less common custom of fulfilling them when the trouble is over.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-13.htm">Psalm 56:13</a><p>"For thou hast delivered my soul from death." His enemies were defeated in their attempts upon his life, and therefore he vowed to devote his life to God. "Wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling?" One mercy is a plea for another, for indeed it may happen that the second is the necessary complement of the first. It little boots that we live, if we are made to fall in character by the thrusts of our enemies. As lief not be, as live to be bereft of honour, and fallen prostrate before my enemies. "That I mall walk before God in the light of the living," enjoying the favour and presence of God, and finding the joy and brightness of life therein. Walking at liberty, in holy service, in sacred communion, in constant progress in holiness, enjoying the smile of heaven - this I seek after. Here is the loftiest reach of a good man's ambition, to dwell with God, to walk in righteousness before him, to rejoice in his presence, and in the light and glory which it yields. Thus in this short Psalm, we have climbed from the ravenous jaws of the enemy into the light of Jehovah's presence, a path which only faith can tread. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/56.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What I have already engaged to do, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-4.htm" title="In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.">Psalm 56:4</a></span>, that I do again and again promise to do, and I cannot sufficiently praise thy goodness in making promises, and thy faithfulness in keeping them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/56.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In God will I praise his word,.... These words are repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-4.htm">Psalm 56:4</a>; and for the greater certainty of the thing, and to show his fixed resolution to do it, and his strong affection for the Lord and his word, they are doubled; <p>in the Lord will I praise his word: in the former clause the word "Elohim" is made use of, which, the Jews say, denotes the property of justice, and in the latter Jehovah, which with them is the property of mercy; and accordingly the Targum paraphrases the words, <p>"in the attribute of the justice of God will I praise his word; in the attribute of the mercies of Jehovah will I praise his word;'' <p>and to the same sense Jarchi: that is, whether I am in adversity or prosperity, receive evil or good things from the hand of the Lord; yet will I praise him: I will sing of mercy and of judgment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-1.htm">Psalm 101:1</a>; or rather the one may denote the grace and goodness of a covenant God in making promises, and the other his truth and faithfulness in keeping them; on account of both which he is worthy of praise. The word "his" is not in either clause in the original text, and they may be rendered, "in God will I praise the word; in the Lord will I praise the word": in and by the help, assistance, and grace of Jehovah the Father, will I praise the eternal and essential Word, his Son. The Targum renders it his "Memra"; a word often used in it for a divine Person, the eternal Logos; the loveliness of his person, the love of his heart to his people, the fulness of grace that is in him, the offices he sustains on their account, and the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, render him praiseworthy in their esteem. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/56.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/56.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. his <span class="ital">word</span>] The omission of the pronoun, which is found in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-4.htm" title="In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.">Psalm 56:4</a></span>, is difficult.

But the repetition may simply be a ‘conflate reading,’ the second line being either the survival or the restoration of the original text, while the first line is due to the ‘Elohistic’ editor.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In God will I praise his word;</span> rather, <span class="accented">through God</span> (see the comment on ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">In the Lord</span> (rather, <span class="accented">through the</span> Lord) <span class="cmt_word">will I praise his word.</span> Professor Cheyne looks upon this as "a feeble Jehovistic interpolation, which interrupts the refrain."

Their rebellion against the counsel of God is ineffective madness. If the poet has God's favour on his side, then he will face these pigmies that behave as though they were giants, who fight against him &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, moving on high, i.e., proudly (cf. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-8.htm">Psalm 73:8</a>), in the invincible might of God. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, inhiare, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-1.htm">Psalm 35:1</a>, with &#1500; like &#1488;&#1500;, e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>. Thus, then, he does not fear; in the day when (Ges. &#1431;123, 3, b) he might well be afraid (conjunctive future, as e.g., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>), he clings trustfully to (&#1488;&#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>, and frequently, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a>) his God, so that fear cannot come near him. He has the word of His promise on his side (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493; as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5</a>); &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, through God will he praise this His word, inasmuch as it is gloriously verified in him. Hupfeld thus correctly interprets it; whereas others in part render it "in Elohim do I praise His word," in part (and the form of this favourite expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a> is opposed to it): "Elohim do I celebrate, His word." Hitzig, however, renders it: "Of God do I boast in matter," i.e., in the present affair; which is most chillingly prosaic in connection with an awkward brevity of language. The exposition is here confused by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-3.htm">Psalm 10:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9</a>. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; does not by any means signify gloriari in this passage, but celebrare; and &#1489;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; is not intended in any other sense than that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-14.htm">Psalm 60:14</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; is equivalent to the New Testament phrase &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;. &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; is a circumstantial clause with a finite verb, as is customary in connection with &#1500;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a>, and &#1506;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-23.htm">Proverbs 19:23</a>. </body></html>
