Yet we are often tempted to repine and despond under small sorrows. For this we should check ourselves. David comforts himself, in his distress and fear, that God noticed all his grievances and all his griefs. God has a bottle and a book for his people's tears, both the tears for their sins, and those for their afflictions. He observes them with tender concern. Every true believer may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and then I will not fear what man shall do unto me; for man has no power but what is given him from above. Thy vows are upon me, O Lord; not as a burden, but as that by which I am known to be thy servant; as a bridle that restrains me from what would be hurtful, and directs me in the way of my duty. And vows of thankfulness properly accompany prayers for mercy. If God deliver us from sin, either from doing it, or by his pardoning mercy, he has delivered our souls from death, which is the wages of sin. Where the Lord has begun a good work he will carry it on and perfect it. David hopes that God would keep him even from the appearance of sin. We should aim in all our desires and expectations of deliverance, both from sin and trouble, that we may do the better service to the Lord; that we may serve him without fear. If his grace has delivered our souls from the death of sin, he will bring us to heaven, to walk before him for ever in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/56.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In God have I put my trust - The sentiment in this verse is the same as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/56-6.htm">Psalm 56:6</a>, except that the word "man" is used here instead of "flesh."

Hitzig's rendering is: "All the time they are injuring my concerns," i.e., injuring my interests. This also sounds unpoetical. Just as we say &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, to do violence to the T&#1508;ra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-4.htm">Zephaniah 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>), so we can also say: to torture any one's words, i.e., his utterances concerning himself, viz., by misconstruing and twisting them. It is no good to David that he asseverates his innocence, that he asserts his filial faithfulness to Saul, God's anointed; they stretch his testimony concerning himself upon the rack, forcing upon it a false meaning and wrong inferences. They band themselves together, they place men in ambush. The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; signifies sometimes to turn aside, turn in, dwell ( equals  Arab. ja&#770;r); sometimes, to be afraid ( equals  &#1497;&#1490;&#1512;, Arab. wjr); sometimes, to stir up, excite, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-3.htm">Psalm 140:3</a> ( equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;); and sometimes, as here, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-15.htm">Isaiah 54:15</a> : to gather together ( equals  &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;).  The Ker reads &#1497;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>), but the scriptio plena points to Hiph. (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a>, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-5.htm">Psalm 126:5</a>), and the following &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; leads one to the conclusion that it is the causative &#1497;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; that is intended: they cause one to keep watch in concealment, they lay an ambush (synon. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-5.htm">1 Samuel 15:5</a>); so that &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; refers to the liers-in-wait told off by them: as to these - they observe my heels or (like the feminine plural in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm">Psalm 89:52</a>) footprints (Rashi: mes traces), i.e., all my footsteps or movements, because (properly, "in accordance with this, that," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>) they now as formerly (which is implied in the perfect, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>) attempt my life, i.e., strive after, lie in wait for it (&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; like &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm">Psalm 71:10</a>, with the accusative  equals  &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-95.htm">Psalm 119:95</a>). To this circumstantial representation of their hostile proceedings is appended the clause &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1470;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, which is not to be understood otherwise than as a question, and is marked as such by the order of the words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-26.htm">2 Kings 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-28.htm">Isaiah 28:28</a>): In spite of iniquity [is there] escape for them? i.e., shall they, the liers-in-wait, notwithstanding such evil good-for-nothing mode of action, escape? At any rate &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496; is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>, a substantivized finitive, and the "by no means" which belongs as answer to this question passes over forthwith into the prayer for the overthrow of the evil ones. This is the customary interpretation since Kimchi's day. Mendelssohn explains it differently: "In vain be their escape," following Aben-Jachja, who, however, like Saadia, takes &#1508;&#1500;&#1496; to be imperative. Certainly adverbial notions are expressed by means of &#1506;&#1500;, - e.g., &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512; ,., abundantly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-24.htm">Psalm 31:24</a>; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, falsely, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-22.htm">Leviticus 5:22</a> (vid., Gesenius, Thesaurus, p. 1028), - but one does not say &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500;, and consequently also would hardly have said &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (by no means, for nothing, in vain); moreover the connection here demands the prevailing ethical notion for &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;. Hupfeld alters &#1508;&#1500;&#1496; to &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1505;, and renders it: "recompense to them for wickedness," which is not only critically improbable, but even contrary to the usage of the language, since &#1508;&#1500;&#1505; signifies to weigh out, but not to requite, and requires the accusative of the object. The widening of the circle of vision to the whole of the hostile world is rightly explained by Hengstenberg by the fact that the special execution of judgment on the part of God is only an outflow of His more general and comprehensive execution of judgment, and the belief in the former has its root in a belief in the latter. The meaning of &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491; becomes manifest from the preceding Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-24.htm">Psalm 55:24</a>), to which the Psalm before us is appended by reason of manifold and closely allied relation. </body></html>
