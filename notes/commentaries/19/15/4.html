We are encouraged to walk in that way. - Here is a very serious question concerning the character of a citizen of Zion. It is the happiness of glorified saints, that they dwell in the holy hill; they are at home there, they shall be for ever there. It concerns us to make it sure to ourselves that we have a place among them. A very plain and particular answer is here given. Those who desire to know their duty, will find the Scripture a very faithful director, and conscience a faithful monitor. A citizen of Zion is sincere in his religion. He is really what he professes to be, and endeavours to stand complete in all the will of God. He is just both to God and man; and, in speaking to both, speaks the truth in his heart. He scorns and abhors wrong and fraud; he cannot reckon that a good bargain, nor a saving one, which is made with a lie; and knows that he who wrongs his neighbour will prove, in the end, to have most injured himself. He is very careful to do hurt to no man. He speaks evil of no man, makes not others' faults the matter of his common talk; he makes the best of every body, and the worst of nobody. If an ill-natured story be told him, he will disprove it if he can; if not, it goes no further. He values men by their virtue and piety. Wicked people are vile people, worthless, and good for nothing; so the word signifies. He thinks the worse of no man's piety for his poverty and mean condition. He reckons that serious piety puts honour upon a man, more than wealth, or a great name. He honours such, desires their conversation and an interest in their prayers, is glad to show them respect, or do them a kindness. By this we may judge of ourselves in some measure. Even wise and good men may swear to their own hurt: but see how strong the obligation is, a man must rather suffer loss to himself and his family, than wrong his neighbour. He will not increase his estate by extortion, or by bribery. He will not, for any gain, or hope of it to himself, do any thing to hurt a righteous cause. Every true living member of the church, like the church itself, is built upon a Rock. He that doeth these things shall not be moved for ever. The grace of God shall always be sufficient for him. The union of these tempers and this conduct, can only spring from repentance for sin, faith in the Saviour, and love to him. In these respects let us examine and prove our own selves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In whose eyes a vile person is contemned - That is, who does not show respect to a man of base or bad character on account of his wealth, his position, or his rank in life. He estimates character as it is in itself, and not as derived from rank, relationship, or station. While, as stated in the previous verse, he is not disposed to take up a false or evil report against another, he is at the same time disposed to do justice to all, and does not honor those who do not deserve to be honored, or apologise for base conduct because it is committed by one of exalted station or rank. Loving virtue and piety for their own sake, he hates all that is opposite; and where conduct deserves reprobation, no matter where found, he does not hesitate to avow his conviction in regard to it. The sentiment here is substantially the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. See the notes at that verse.<p>But he honoreth them that fear the Lord - No matter in what rank or condition of life they may be found. Where there is true piety he honors it. He is willing to be known as one that honors it, and is willing to bear all the reproach that may be connected with such a deeply cherished respect, and with such an avowal. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>.<p>He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not - Who has made a promise, or entered into a contract, that is likely to turn out contrary to his expectations, to his own disadvantage; but who still adheres to his engagement. If the thing itself is wrong; if he has made a promise, or pledged himself to do a wicked thing, he cannot be under obligation to execute it; he should at once abandon it (compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a>); but he is not at liberty to violate an agreement simply because it will be a loss to him, or because he ascertains that it will not be, as he supposed, to his advantage. The principles here laid down will extend to all contracts or agreements, pecuniary or otherwise, and should be a general principle regulating all our transactions with our fellow-men. The only limitation in the rule is that above stated, when the promise or the contract would involve that which is morally wrong. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

He doth not admire his person, nor envy his condition, nor court him with flatteries, nor value his company and conversation, nor approve of or comply with his courses; but he thinks meanly of him; he judgeth him a most miserable man, and a great object of pity; he abhors his wicked practices, and labours to make such ways contemptible and hateful to all men as far as it lies in his power. But this contempt of wicked men must be so managed as not to cause a contempt of just authority, which if it be lodged in a wicked hand, doth challenge not only obedience, but also honour and reverence; as is manifest from the precepts and examples of Christ and of his apostles, who charge this upon the Christians every where, although the magistrates of those times were unquestionably vile and wicked men.

A "vile" man is a very wicked, profligate, and abandoned creature, one that is to every good work reprobate; and such sometimes are in high places, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>; and are greatly caressed and esteemed by the men of the world; but then, as they are an abomination to God, they should be despised by his people, let them be what they will as to their riches, honours, and wisdom among men; as Haman was by Mordecai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-2.htm">Esther 3:2</a>; and Ahab by Elisha, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>; and such who keep company with, and express a delight and pleasure in such sort of persons, ought by no means to have a place in the house of God. Some understand this of a good man being "despised in his own eyes", as it may be rendered (f); on account of his vileness, and the imperfection of his obedience, and as expressive of his great humility, esteeming others better than himself; and who renounces himself, and is rejected by himself, having a very mean opinion of himself; which is the sense of the Targum, Aben Ezra, and Kimchi; and which is no bad sense, though the former is countenanced by what follows; <p>but he honoureth them that fear the Lord; who have the covenant grace of fear wrought in their hearts, and serve the Lord with reverence and godly fear; that is, who are truly religious and godly persons; these such who are fit members of the church of Christ love heartily, esteem of highly, and honour them by thinking and speaking well of them, and behaving with great respect and decency to them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>; <p>he that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not; having taken a solemn oath, so sacred is it with him, and such a regard has he to the name of God, by whom he swears, that though it is to his civil loss and detriment, yet he will not break it and depart from it, but punctually observe it: some render it, "he that swears to his neighbour, and changeth not" (g); he that is just to his word, faithful to his promises, that exactly fulfils all the obligations he lays himself under unto others; he that is honest and upright in all his dealings. The Jewish writers interpret this clause of a man's vowing and swearing to afflict himself by fasting, which, though it is to the emaciating of his body, yet he strictly observes his vow or oath; but this is foreign from the scope of the place: it might be rendered, "he that swears to do evil, and does not recompense or perform" (h), it being better to break through such an oath than to keep it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>. <p>(f)  "qui despicit se in oculis suis", so some in Vatablus; "ille est despectus in propriis oculis, reprobatus", Gussetius, p. 453.

But (1) the words ‘despicable reprobate’ are such as David could hardly use to express humility and self-abasement; and (2) the contrast required by the parallelism is not ‘he despises himself and honours others,’ but ‘he abhors the base and honours the godly,’ i.e. shews right discernment in his regard for men. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-3.htm" title="But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.">Psalm 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm" title="Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.">1 Samuel 2:30</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He that <span class="ital">sweareth</span> &c] Though he hath sworn to his own hurt, he changeth not. He performs his oaths and vows without modification or rebatement, even though they may have been rashly made and prove to be to his own disadvantage. Comp. the phrase in the Law for the expiation of rash oaths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm" title="Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.">Leviticus 5:4</a>), “if any one swear rashly with his lips <span class="ital">to do evil</span> or to do good.” Any ‘changing’ of animals devoted by vows (which were of the nature of oaths) was expressly forbidden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-10.htm" title="He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.">Leviticus 27:10</a>).

(as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm" title="They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appears before God.">Psalm 84:7</a>) combines both renderings in its paraphrase, ‘He that sweareth <span class="ital">unto his neighbour</span> and disappointeth him not, <span class="ital">though it were to his own hindrance</span>.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whose eyes a vile person is contemned</span>. So the LXX., the Vulgate, Ewald, Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, and the Revised Version. Others prefer to translate, "He is despised in his own eyes, [and] worthless" (Abort Ezra, Hitzig, Delitzsch, Kay, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Either rendering furnishes a good sense; but the law of parallelism is very decidedly in favour of the former. As the righteous man honors those who fear God, so he contemns those who are vile or worthless. He is no respecter of persons. Men's outward circumstances are nothing to him. He awards honour or contempt according to men's moral qualities. But he honoreth them that fear the Lord. "It is no common virtue," says Calvin, "to honour pious and godly men, since in the opinion of the world they are often as the offscouring of all things (1 Corinthans 4:13)? He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. The righteous man, if he happens to have sworn to do something which it turns out will be to his own hurt, nevertheless keeps his engagement (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used in the same sense). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Jahve thus bursts forth in scorn His word, which never fails in its working, smites down these brutish men, who are without knowledge and conscience. The local demonstrative &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is used as temporal in this passage just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-17.htm">Hosea 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-7.htm">Job 23:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/35-12.htm">Job 35:12</a>, and is joined with the perfect of certainty, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-13.htm">Job 36:13</a>, where it has not so much a temporal as a local sense. It does not mean "there  equals  at a future time," as pointing into the indefinite future, but "there  equals  then," when God shall thus speak to them in His anger. Intensity is here given to the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; by the addition of a substantival object of the same root, just as is frequently the case in the more elevated style, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>; and as is done in other cases by the addition of the adverbial infinitive. Then, when God's long-suffering changes into wrath, terror at His judgement seizes them and they tremble through and through. This judgment of wrath, however, is on the other hand a revelation of love. Jahve avenges and thus delivers those whom He calls &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; (My people); and who are here called &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, the generation of the righteous, in opposition to the corrupted humanity of the time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">Psalm 12:8</a>), as being conformed to the will of God and held together by a superior spirit to the prevailing spirit of the age. They are so called inasmuch as &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; passes over from the signification generatio to that of genus hominum here and also elsewhere, when it is not merely a temporal, but a moral notion; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-6.htm">Psalm 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-15.htm">Psalm 83:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-2.htm">Psalm 112:2</a>, where it uniformly denotes the whole of the children of God who are in bondage in the world and longing for deliverance, not Israel collectively in antithesis to the Scythians and the heathen in general (Hitzig). </body></html>
