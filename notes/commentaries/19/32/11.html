David gives a word of caution to sinners. The reason for this caution is, that the way of sin will certainly end in sorrow. Here is a word of comfort to saints. They may see that a life of communion with God is far the most pleasant and comfortable. Let us rejoice, O Lord Jesus, in thee, and in thy salvation; so shall we rejoice indeed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be glad in the Lord - Rejoice in the Lord. Rejoice that there is a God; rejoice that he is such as he is; rejoice in his favor; find your joy - your supreme joy - in him. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>, note.<p>Ye righteous - You who are willing to go to him and confess your sins; you who are willing to serve and obey him. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a>. The meaning is, that those who are disposed to confess their sins, and are willing to submit to him without being compelled by force, as the horse and the mule are, will find occasion for rejoicing. They will find a God who is worthy of their love, and they will find true happiness in him.<p>And shout for joy - Give expression to your joy. Let it not remain merely in the heart; but give it utterance in the language of song. If any of the dwellers on earth have occasion for the loud utterances of praise, they are those who are redeemed; whose sins are forgiven; who have the hope of heaven. If there is any occasion when the heart should be full of joy, and when the lips should give forth loud utterances of praise, it is when one pressed down with the consciousness of guilt, and overwhelmed with the apprehensions of wrath, makes confession to God, and secures the hope of heaven.<p>All ye that are upright in heart - That is, who are sincere in your confession of sin, and in your desires to secure the favor of God. Such have occasion for joy, for to such God will show himself merciful, as He did to the psalmist when He made confession of sin; to such God will give the tokens of his favor, and the hope of heaven, as he did to him. The experience of the psalmist, therefore, as recorded in this psalm, should be full of encouragement to all who are burdened with a sense of sin. Warned by his experience, they should not attempt to conceal their transgressions in their own bosom, but they should go at once, as he was constrained at last to go, and make full and free confession to God. So doing, they will find that God is not slow to pardon them, and to fill their hearts with peace, and their lips with praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

David's psalms almost always end with a note of joy, or at any rate in a tone that is cheerful and encouraging. The present psalm, though reckoned among the penitential ones, both begins and ends with joyful utterances. In vers. 1, 2 David pours forth the feeling of gladness which fills his own heart. Here he calls upon the "righteous" generally, who yet need forgiveness, to rejoice with him. <span class="cmt_word">And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart</span>. All ye, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, who are honest and sincere in your endeavours after well-doing. The phrase explains the "righteous" of the preceding hemistich. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For, as his own experience has taught the poet, he who does not in confession pour out all his corruption before God, only tortures himself until he unburdens himself of his secret curse. Since <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a> by itself cannot be regarded as the reason for the proposition just laid down, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; signifies either "because, quod" (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22</a>) or "when, quum" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-16.htm">Judges 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>. The &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1490;&#1492; was an outburst of the tortures which his accusing conscience prepared for him. The more he strove against confessing, the louder did conscience speak; and while it was not in his power to silence this inward voice, in which the wrath of God found utterance, he cried the whole day, viz., for help; but while his heart was still unbroken, he cried yet received no answer. He cried all day long, for God's punishing right hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>) lay heavey upon him day and night; the feeling of divine wrath left him no rest, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14</a>. A fire burned within him which threatened completely to devour him. The expression is &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (like &#1489;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-4.htm">Psalm 102:4</a>), without &#1499;, inasmuch as the fears which burn fiercely within him even to his heart and, as it were, scorch him up, he directly calls the droughts of summer. The &#1489;&#1468; is the Beth of the state or condition, in connection with which the change, i.e., degeneration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14</a>), took place; for mutare in aliquid is expressed by &#1492;&#1508;&#1498; &#1500;. The &#1500; (which Saadia and others have mistaken) in &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; is part of the root; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491; (from &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, Arab. lsd, to suck), inflected after the analogy of &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; and the like, signifies succus. In the summer-heat of anxiety his vital moisture underwent a change: it burned and dried up. Here the music becomes louder and does its part in depicting these torments of the awakened conscience in connection with a heart that still remains unbroken. In spite of this &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, however, the historical connection still retains sufficient influence to give &#1488;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498; the force of the imperfect (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>): "I made known my sin and my guilt did I not cover up (&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; used here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-13.htm">Proverbs 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-33.htm">Job 31:33</a>); I made the resolve: I will confess my transgressions to the Lord (&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;  equals  &#1495;&#1514;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-2.htm">Nehemiah 9:2</a>; elsewhere construed with the accusative, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>) - then Thou forgavest," etc. Hupfeld is inclined to place &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; before &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498;, by which &#1488;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498; and &#1488;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; would become futures; but &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; sounds like an assertion of a fact, not the statement of an intention, and &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; is the natural continuation of the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; which immediately precedes. The form &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; is designedly used instead of &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;. Simultaneously with his confession of sin, made fide supplice, came also the absolution: then Thou forgavest the guilt (&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;, misdeed, as a deed and also as a matter of fact, i.e., guilt contracted, and penance or punishment, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-6.htm">Lamentations 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-19.htm">Zechariah 14:19</a>) of my sin. Vox nondum est in ore, says Augustine, et vulnus sanatur in corde. The &#1505;&#1500;&#1492; here is the antithesis of the former one. There we have a shrill lament over the sinner who tortures himself in vain, here the clear tones of joy at the blessed experience of one who pours forth his soul to God - a musical Yea and Amen to the great truth of justifying grace. </body></html>
