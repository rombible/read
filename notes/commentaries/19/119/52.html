He that by his Spirit works faith in us, will work for us. The word of God speaks comfort in affliction. If, through grace, it makes us holy, there is enough in it to make us easy, in all conditions. Let us be certain we have the Divine law for what we believe, and then let not scoffers prevail upon us to decline from it. God's judgments of old comfort and encourage us, for he is still the same. Sin is horrible in the eyes of all that are sanctified. Ere long the believer will be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. In the mean time, the statutes of the Lord supply subjects for grateful praise. In the season of affliction, and in the silent hours of the night, he remembers the name of the Lord, and is stirred up to keep the law. All who have made religion the first thing, will own that they have been unspeakable gainers by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I remembered - In my troubles.<p>Thy judgments of old - The word "judgments" here seems to refer to the divine dealings, whether expressed in the law of God, or in the actual administration of his government over the world. The words "of old" do not seem here to refer to the "eternity past," as the phrase sometimes does now, but to the constancy and uniformity of the principles of the divine administration. The psalmist remembered that the principles of that administration had been always the same; that the law of God was always the same; and that, therefore, he might confide in God. What God had done formerly he would do now; the favor which he had shown in times past he would continue to show now. In the trials of life, in the changes which occur, in the apparent wreck of things, in the fearful prospect of disaster and ruin at any time, it is well for us to think of the unchanging principles which mark the divine dealings. Under such an administration, all who put their trust in God must be safe.<p>And have comforted myself - I have found consolation in this. When all else seemed to fail, it was a comfort to reflect that an unchangeable God presided over the affairs of people. We could not put confidence in a God given to change. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>52-56. The pious take comfort, when harassed and distressed by wickedness of men who forsake God's law, in remembering that the great principles of God's truth will still abide; and also God's<p>judgments of old&#8212;that is, His past interpositions in behalf of His people are a pledge that He will again interpose to deliver them; and they become the theme of constant and delightful meditation. The more we keep the more we love the law of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy judgments of old; </span> thy former and ancient dispensations to the children of men in punishing the ungodly, and protecting and delivering thy faithful servants, whose experience is my encouragement. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/119.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I remembered thy judgments of old, O Lord,.... Either the judgments of God executed on wicked men; as the bringing a flood on the world of the ungodly; the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah; the destruction of Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea; the cutting off of the Canaanites, and dispossessing them of their land: or the providential dispensations of God towards his own people; who sometimes chastises and corrects them, and brings them very low, and then raises them up again, as in the case of Job. These things the psalmist called to remembrance, and revolved them in his mind, which gave him pleasure and comfort: <p>and have comforted myself; with such thoughts as these, that that God, who had cast down the mighty from their seats, and had scattered the proud in the imaginations of their hearts, and destroyed them, could easily rebuke the proud that had him in derision; and he that had shown himself so good and gracious to his people, when brought low, could raise him out of his afflictions and distresses. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I remembered thy <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.</span><p>(c) That is, the examples, by which you declare yourself to be judge of the world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">52</span>. <span class="ital">I</span> have <span class="ital">remembered thy judgments</span> which have been from ancient times (LXX <span class="greekheb">ἀπ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">αἰῶνος</span>, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-70.htm" title="As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:">Luke 1:70</a>), either (as generally in the Psalm) the Divine ordinances or principles of right revealed from ancient times, which are true and sure in spite of all the scoffers’ ridicule: or perhaps here, the judicial acts by which those ordinances have been maintained and vindicated in the course of history, and which will in due time descend upon the scoffers of the present.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I remembered thy judgments of old, O Lord</span>.

He prays for the grace of true and fearlessly joyous confession. The lxx renders <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-41.htm">Psalm 119:41</a>: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5; &#787; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; but the Targum and Jerome rightly (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-77.htm">Psalm 119:77</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>) have the plural: God's proofs of loving-kindness in accordance with His promises will put him in the position that he will not be obliged to be dumb in the presence of him who reproaches him (&#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, prop. a plucker, cf. Arab. charu&#770;f, a lamb  equals  a plucker of leaves or grass), but will be able to answer him on the ground of his own experience. The verb &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, which in itself has many meanings, acquires the signification "to give an answer" through the word, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, that is added (synon. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a> also refers to the duty of confessing God. The meaning of the prayer is, that God may not suffer him to come to such a pass that he will be utterly unable to witness for the truth; for language dies away in the mouth of him who is unworthy of its before God. The writer has no fear of this for himself, for his hope is set towards God's judgments (&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1498;, defective plural, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-149.htm">Psalm 119:149</a>; in proof of which, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-156.htm">Psalm 119:156</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-175.htm">Psalm 119:175</a>), his confidence takes its stand upon them. The futures which follow from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-44.htm">Psalm 119:44</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-48.htm">Psalm 119:48</a> declare that what he would willingly do by the grace of God, and strives to do, is to walk &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1492;, in a broad space (elsewhere &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;), therefore unstraitened, which in this instance is not equivalent to happily, but courageously and unconstrainedly, without allowing myself to be intimidated, and said of inward freedom which makes itself known outwardly. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-46.htm">Psalm 119:46</a> the Vulgate renders: Et loquebar de (in) testimoniis tuis in conspectu regum et non confundebar - the motto of the Augsburg Confession, to which it was adapted especially in connection with this historical interpretation of the two verbs, which does not correspond to the original text. The lifting up of the hands in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-48.htm">Psalm 119:48</a> is an expression of fervent longing desire, as in connection with prayer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, and frequently. The second &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497; is open to the suspicion of being an inadvertent repetition. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468; (synon. &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1490;&#1492;) signifies a still or audible meditating that is absorbed in the object. </body></html>
