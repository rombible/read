He desired to know more of God in Christ; to know more of the doctrines of the word, and the duties of religion. He had a deep sense of unworthiness, and holy fear that his prayer should not come before God; Lord, what I pray for is, what thou hast promised. We have learned nothing to purpose, if we have not learned to praise God. We should always make the word of God the rule of our discourse, so as never to transgress it by sinful speaking, or sinful silence. His own hands are not sufficient, nor can any creature lend him help; therefore he looks up to God, that the hand that had made him may help him. He had made religion his deliberate choice. There is an eternal salvation all the saints long for, and therefore they pray that God would help their way to it. Let thy judgments help me; let all ordinances and all providences, (both are God's judgments,) further me in glorifying God; let them help me for that work. He often looks back with shame and gratitude to his lost estate. He still prays for the tender care of Him who purchased his flock with his own blood, that he may receive from him the gift of eternal life. Seek me, that is, Find me; for God never seeks in vain. Turn me, and I shall be turned. Let this psalm be a touchstone by which to try our hearts, and our lives. Do our hearts, cleansed in Christ's blood, make these prayers, resolutions and confessions our own? Is God's word the standard of our faith, and the law of our practice? Do we use it as pleas with Christ for what we need? Happy those who live in such delightful exercises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let thine hand help me - Do thou help me - the hand being that by which we accomplish anything.<p>For I have chosen that precepts - I have chosen them as my comforters and my guide.

Here Sin and Shin coincide, and Samech is specially represented.)).<p>In the midst of persecution God's word was still his fear, his joy, and his love, the object of his thanksgiving, and the ground of his hope. Princes persecute him without adequate cause, but his heart does not fear before them, but before God's words (the Ker likes the singular, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-147.htm">Psalm 119:147</a>), to deny which would be to him the greatest possible evil. It is, however, a fear that is associated with heartfelt joy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a>). It is the joy of a conflict that is rewarded by rich spoil (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>). Not merely morning and evening, not merely three times a day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a>), but seven times (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>), i.e., ever again and again, availing himself of every prayerful impulse, he gives thanks to God for His word, which so righteously decides and so correctly guides, is a source of transcendent peace to all who love it, and beside which one is not exposed to any danger of stumbling (&#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;, lxx &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-10.htm">1 John 2:10</a>) without some effectual counter-working. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-166.htm">Psalm 119:166</a> he speaks like Jacob in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-18.htm">Genesis 49:18</a>, and can speak thus, inasmuch as he has followed earnestly and untiringly after sanctification. He endeavours to keep God's law most conscientiously, in proof of which he is able to appeal to God the Omniscient One. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; is here the 3rd praet., whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a> it is imperat.
