All true wisdom is from God. A good man carries his Bible with him, if not in his hands, yet in his head and in his heart. By meditation on God's testimonies we understand more than our teachers, when we understand our own hearts. The written word is a more sure guide to heaven, than all the fathers, the teachers, and ancients of the church. We cannot, with any comfort or boldness, attend God in holy duties, while under guilt, or in any by-way. It was Divine grace in his heart, that enabled the psalmist to receive these instructions. The soul has its tastes as well as the body. Our relish for the word of God will be greatest, when that for the world and the flesh is least. The way of sin is a wrong way; and the more understanding we get by the precepts of God, the more rooted will be our hatred of sin; and the more ready we are in the Scriptures, the better furnished we are with answers to temptation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I understand more than the ancients - Hebrew, The old men. It does not refer, as the word "ancients" does with us, to the people of former times, but to aged men. They have treasured up wisdom. They have had the advantage of experience, of study, and of observation. They, therefore, like teachers, become a standard by which we measure our own attainments, as the boy hardly hopes to gain that amount of knowledge which he observes in people who are venerable in years, and who are remarkable for their acquirements. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a> : "With the ancient is wisdom, and in length of days understanding." <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-7.htm">Job 32:7</a> : "I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom." Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30-31</a>. Yet the psalmist says that he "had" reached this point, and had even gone beyond what he had once thought he could never attain.<p>Because I keep thy precepts - It is all the result of an honest endeavor to do right; to observe law; to keep the commands of God. Obedience to the law of God will do more than any mere human teaching to make a man truly wise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>100. more than the ancients&#8212;Antiquity is no help against stupidity, where it does not accord with God's word [Luther] (Job 32:7-9).

Than those that had lived in ages before him; having clearer light given him, and larger discoveries made unto him, concerning the Messiah, his person and offices particularly, as it was usual for the Lord to do; or than aged men in his own time: for though wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, may be reasonably supposed to be with ancient men; who have had a long experience of things, and have had time and opportunity of making their observations, and of laying up a stock of knowledge; and this may be expected from them, and they may be applied to for it; yet this is not always the case; a younger man, as David was, may be endued with more knowledge and understanding than such; so Elihu; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm">Job 8:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm">Job 32:6</a>. Or, "I have got understanding by the ancients"; so Kimchi; though the other sense seems preferable; <p>because I keep thy precepts; keep close to the word; attend to the reading of it, and meditation on it; keep it in mind and memory, and observe to do the commands of it; and by that means obtained a good understanding, even a better one than the ancients; especially than they that were without it, or did not carefully attend unto it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">100</span>.

Eternal and imperishable in the constant verifying of itself is the vigorous and consolatory word of God, to which the poet will ever cling. It has heaven as its standing-place, and therefore it also has the qualities of heaven, and before all others, heaven-like stability. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>) uses similar language in reference to God's faithfulness, of which here <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-90.htm">Psalm 119:90</a> says that it endureth into all generations. The earth hath He creatively set up, and it standeth, viz., as a practical proof and as a scene of His infinite, unchangeable faithfulness. Heaven and earth are not the subjects of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a> (Hupfeld), for only the earth is previously mentioned; the reference to the heavens in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a> is of a very different character. Hitzig and others see the subject in &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;: with respect to Thy judgments, they stand fast unto this day; but the &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; which follows requires another meaning to be assigned to &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;: either of taking up one's place ready for service, or, since &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; is a current phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-24.htm">Ezekiel 44:24</a>, of placing one's self ready to obey (Bttcher). The subject of &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, as the following &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; shows, is meant to be thought of in the most general sense (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-14.htm">Job 38:14</a>): all beings are God's servants (subjects), and have accordingly to be obedient and humble before His judicial decisions - &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, "even to this day," the poet adds, for these judicial decisions are those which are formulated beforehand in the Tra. Joy in this ever sure, all-conditioning word has upheld the poet in his affliction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>. He who has been persecuted and cast down as it were to death, owes his reviving to it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-93.htm">Psalm 119:93</a>.

He knows from experience that all (earthly) perfection (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;) has an end (inasmuch as, having reached its height, it changes into its opposite); God's commandment (singular as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-22.htm">Deuteronomy 11:22</a>), on the contrary, is exceeding broad (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>), unlimited in its duration and verification. </body></html>
