The Romans afterward introduced among them the custom of dividing it into four watches, consisting of three hours each, as well as of dividing the day and the night into twelve hours each. David intimates that he meditated on God, not only in the day-time, but also in the several divisions of the night, wherein different soldiers, or different parties of soldiers, were appointed to watch, or keep guard. In all these, or at least during a considerable part of each of them, he was thus wakeful, and employed in meditation and prayer.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>119:145-152 Supplications with the whole heart are presented only by those who desire God's salvation, and who love his commandments. Whither should the child go but to his father? Save me from my sins, my corruptions, my temptations, all the hinderances in my way, that I may keep thy testimonies. Christians who enjoy health, should not suffer the early hours of the morning to glide away unimproved. Hope in God's word encourages us to continue in prayer. It is better to take time from sleep, than not to find time for prayer. We have access to God at all hours; and if our first thoughts in the morning are of God, they will help to keep us in his fear all the day long. Make me lively and cheerful. God knows what we need and what is good for us, and will quicken us. If we are employed in God's service, we need not fear those who try to set themselves as far as they can out of the reach of the convictions and commands of his law. When trouble is near, God is near. He is never far to seek. All his commandments are truth. And God's promises will be performed. All that ever trusted in God have found him faithful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried - I anticipated it; I rose up to pray before the morning dawned. On the word "prevent," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>; notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>; notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>. The meaning here is, that he rose up before the dawn, to pray. Thus the Saviour did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>.<p>(a) It is proper thus to pray, for our earliest thoughts should be those of devotion; our earliest acts should be in acknowledgment of God.<p>(b) Such a time is eminently favorable to devotion. Calm, still, quiet; before the thoughts are engaged in the world, and before the cares of life press upon us when the thoughts are clear, and the mind tranquil, the soul is in the best state for devotion.<p>(c) All people, if they will, can secure this time, before the "dawning of the morning," to pray. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-13.htm">Psalm 88:13</a>, note; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-6.htm">Psalm 130:6</a>. The word rendered "dawning of the morning," is from a verb which means to blow; to blow gently; and is usually applied to the evening, when the breezes blow gently. It may be applied, however, as it clearly is here, also to the morning.<p>I hoped in thy word - I prayed because I had hope in thy word; I exercised hope in thy word then. Alone with thee in the morning, I found consolation by trusting in thy gracious promises. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>147. prevented&#8212;literally, "came before," anticipated not only the dawn, but even the usual periods of the night; when the night watches, which might be expected to find me asleep, come, they find me awake (Ps 63:6; 77:4; La 2:19).

God rules righteously and faithfully according to His word, for which the poet is accordingly zealous, although young and despised. The predicate &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-137.htm">Psalm 119:137</a> precedes its subject &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; (God's decisions in word and in deed) in the primary form (after the model of the verbal clause <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-5.htm">Psalm 124:5</a>), just as in German [and English] the predicative adjective remains undeclined. The accusatives &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; and &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-138.htm">Psalm 119:138</a> are not predicative (Hitzig), to which the former ("as righteousness") - not the latter however - is not suited, but adverbial accusatives (in righteousness, in faithfulness), and &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; according to its position is subordinate to &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; as a virtual adjective (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>): the requirements of the revealed law proceed from a disposition towards and mode of dealing with men which is strictly determined by His holiness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;), and beyond measure faithfully and honestly designs the well-being of men (&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;). To see this good law of God despised by his persecutors stirs the poet up with a zeal, which brings him, from their side, to the brink of extreme destruction (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-10.htm">Psalm 69:10</a>, cf. &#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-17.htm">Psalm 88:17</a>). God's own utterance is indeed without spot, and therefore not to be carped at; it is pure, fire-proved, noblest metal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-7.htm">Psalm 12:7</a>), therefore he loves it, and does not, though young (lxx &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Vulgate adolescentulus) and lightly esteemed, care for the remonstrances of his proud opponents who are old and more learned than himself (the organization of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-141.htm">Psalm 119:141</a> is like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-95.htm">Psalm 119:95</a>, and frequently). The righteousness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;) of the God of revelation becomes eternal righteousness (&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;), and His law remains eternal truth (&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;). &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; is here the name of the attribute and of the action that is conditioned in accordance with it; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; the name of the state that thoroughly accords with the idea of that which is right. So too in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-144.htm">Psalm 119:144</a> : &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; are Jahve's testimonies for ever, so that all creatures must give glory to their harmony with that which is absolutely right. To look ever deeper and deeper into this their perfection is the growing life of the spirit. The poet prays for this vivifying insight. </body></html>
