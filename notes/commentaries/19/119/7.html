As far as our views, desires, and affections agree with what is here expressed, they come from the influences of the Holy Spirit, and no further. The pardoning mercy of God in Christ, is the only source of a sinner's happiness. And those are most happy, who are preserved most free from the defilement of sin, who simply believe God's testimonies, and depend on his promises. If the heart be divided between him and the world, it is evil. But the saints carefully avoid all sin; they are conscious of much evil that clogs them in the ways of God, but not of that wickedness which draws them out of those ways. The tempter would make men think they are at them out of those ways. The tempter would make men think they are at liberty to follow the word of God or not, as they please. But the desire and prayer of a good man agree with the will and command of God. If a man expects by obedience in one thing to purchase indulgence for disobedience in others, his hypocrisy will be detected; if he is not ashamed in this world, everlasting shame will be his portion. The psalmist coveted to learn the laws of God, to give God the glory. And believers see that if God forsakes them, the temper will be too hard for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will praise thee with uprightness of heart - With an upright and sincere heart.<p>When I shall have learned - Hebrew, "In my learning."

He had no doubt of finding that they were worthy of his praises, and of seeing in them more and more occasion to glorify and honor God. The more we know of God, the more shall we see in him to praise. The larger our acquaintance and experience, the more our hearts will be disposed to magnify his name. This remark must extend to all that there is in God to be learned; and as that is infinite, so there will be occasion for renewed and more elevated praise to all eternity.<p>Thy righteous judgments - Margin, as in Hebrew, "Judgments of thy righteousness."

Now the precepts of the one, and the doctrines of the other, are to be learned, and learned of God, in his word and by his Spirit. The psalmist had been learning them, but was desirous of learning more of them, not being a complete proficient in them; and of learning them, not merely in the theory, but in the practice and experience of them; which, when he had attained unto, as he hoped he should, it would be matter of the most sincere praise and thankfulness. <p>(o)  "judicia justitiae tuae", Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version, Musculus, Gejerus; so Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will praise thee with uprightness of <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> judgments.</span><p>(d) For true religion stands in serving God without hypocrisy.<p>(e) That is, your precepts, which contain perfect righteousness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Piqqudîm</span>, <span class="greekheb">δικαιώματα</span> (21 times), ‘precepts,’ ‘injunctions,’ LXX <span class="greekheb">ἐντολαί</span>, a poetical word found only in the Psalter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-8.htm" title="The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.">Psalm 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-18.htm" title="To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.">Psalm 103:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-7.htm" title="The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.">Psalm 111:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">7</span>.
