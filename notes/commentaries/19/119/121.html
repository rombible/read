Christ our Surety, having paid our debt and ransom, secures all the blessings of salvation to every true believer. The psalmist expects the word of God's righteousness, and no other salvation than what is secured by that word, which cannot fall to the ground. We deserve no favour form God; we are most easy when we cast ourselves upon God's mercy, and refer ourselves to it. If any man resolve to do God's will as his servant, he shall be made to know his testimonies. We must do what we can for the support of religion, and, after all, must beg of God to take the work into his own hands. It is hypocrisy to say we love God's commandments more than our worldly interests. The way of sin is a false way, being directly contrary to God's precepts, which are right: those that love and esteem God's law, hate sin, and will not be reconciled to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have done judgment and justice - This commences a new division of the psalm, indicated by the Hebrew letter Ayin (&#1506; &#8219;) - a letter which cannot well be represented in the English alphabet, as there is, in fact, no letter in our language exactly corresponding with it. It would be best represented probably by what are called "breathings" in Greek. The meaning of the first part of this verse is, "I have led a righteous and upright life." It is equivalent to saying that he had kept the law of God, or had made that the rule of his conduct.<p>Leave me not to mine oppressors - To the people who would do me wrong; who seek my hurt. He urged this on the ground that he had been obedient to the divine law, and might, therefore, with propriety, make this request, or might claim the divine protection. Man has no merit of his own, and no claim on God; but when he is his true friend, it is not improper to expect that he will interpose in his behalf; nor is it improper to present this in the form of a prayer. Our loving God, and serving him, though it is done imperfectly, is, in fact, a reason why he should and will interpose in our behalf. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>AIN.

On the grounds of his integrity, desire for God's word, and covenant relation to Him, the servant of God may plead for His protecting care against the wicked, gracious guidance to the knowledge of truth, and His effective vindication of the righteous and their cause, which is also His own.<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/119.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>121 I have done judgment and justice - leave me not to mine oppressors.<p>122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.<p>123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.<p>124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.<p>125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.<p>126 It is time for thee, Lord, to work - for they have made void thy law.<p>127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.<p>128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-121.htm">Psalm 119:121</a><p>"I have done judgment and justice." This was a great thing for an Eastern ruler to say at any time, for these despots mostly cared more for gain than justice. Some of them altogether neglected their duty, and would not even do judgment at all, preferring their pleasures to their duties; and many more of them sold their judgments to the highest bidders by taking bribes, or regarding the persons of men. Some rulers gave neither judgment nor justice, others gave judgment without justice, but David gave judgment and justice, and saw that his sentences were carried out. He could claim before the Lord that he had dealt out even-handed justice, and was doing so still. On this fact he founded a plea with which he backed the prayer - "Leave me not to mine oppressors." He who, as far as his power goes, has been doing right, may hope to be delivered from his superiors when attempts are made by them to do him wrong. If I will not oppress others, I may hopefully pray that others may not oppress me. A course of upright conduct is one which gives us boldness in appealing to the Great Judge for deliverance from the injustice of others. Nor is this kind of pleading to be censured as self-righteous: when we are dealing with God as to our shortcomings, we use a very different tone from that with which we face the censures of our fellow-men; when they are in the question, and we are guiltless towards them, we are justified in pleading our innocence.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-122.htm">Psalm 119:122</a><p>"Be surety for thy servant for good." Answer for me. Do not leave thy poor servant to die by the hand of his enemy and thine. Take up my interests and weave them with thine own, and stand for me. As my Master, undertake thy servants' cause, and represent me before the faces of haughty men till they see what an august ally I have in the Lord my God.<p>"Let not the proud oppress me." Thine interposition will answer the purpose of my rescue, when the proud see that thou art my advocate they will hide their heads. We should have been crushed beneath our proud adversary the devil if our Lord Jesus had not stood between us and the accuser, and become a surety for us. It is by his suretiship that we escape like a bird from the snare of the fowler. What a blessing to be able to leave our matters in our Surety's hands, knowing that all will be well, since he has an answer for every accuser, a rebuke for every reviler.<p>Good men dread oppression, for it makes even a wise man mad, and they send up their cries to heaven for deliverance; nor shall they cry in vain, for the Lord will undertake the cause of his servants, and fight their battles against the proud. The word "servant" is wisely used as a plea for favour for himself, and the word "proud" as an argument against his enemies. It seems to be inevitable that proud men should become oppressors, and that they should take most delight in oppressing really gracious men.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div><span class="bld">AIN</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ver. 121. <span class="bld">Judgment and justice, </span> i.e. just judgment, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm" title="If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regards; and there be higher than they.">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a></span>, to wit, towards mine oppressors, whom I have no way injured. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/119.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>AIN.--The Sixteenth Part. <p>AIN.

The Syriac version takes it to be an address to God, and as describing him, "O thou that doest judgment and justice!" to whom the following petition is directed: <p>leave me not to mine oppressors; David had his oppressors, as all good men have, and power was on their side; but they could do no more, nor further exercise it, than as they were permitted by the Lord; for they had no power but what was given them from above; and he applies to God, and not men, for relief; and deprecates being given up to them, and left in their hands. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">121</span>.

His hope rests on God's word, without allowing itself to be led astray by doubters and apostates. &#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; (the form of nouns which indicate defects or failings) are those inwardly divided, halting between two opinions (&#1505;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;),    <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, who do homage partly to the worship of Jahve, partly to heathenism, and therefore are trying to combine faith and naturalism. In contrast to such, the poet's love, faith, and hope are devoted entirely to the God of revelation; and to all those who are desirous of drawing him away he addresses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-115.htm">Psalm 119:115</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a>) an indignant "depart." He, however, stands in need of grace in order to persevere and to conquer. For this he prays in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-116.htm">Psalm 119:116-117</a>. The &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is the same as in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1503;. The ah of &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; is the intentional ah (Ew. 228, c), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>. The statement of the ground of the &#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, vilipendis, does not mean: unsuccessful is their deceit (Hengstenberg, Olshausen), but falsehood without the consistency of truth is their self-deceptive and seductive tendency.

Accordingly &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-120.htm">Psalm 119:120</a> are God's punitive judgments, or rather (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a>) God's laws (judgments) according to which He judges. What is meant are sentences of punishment, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.
