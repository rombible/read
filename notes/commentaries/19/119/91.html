And the engagements of God's covenant are established more firmly than the earth itself. All the creatures answer the ends of their creation: shall man, who alone is endued with reason, be the only unprofitable burden of the earth? We may make the Bible a pleasant companion at any time. But the word, without the grace of God, would not quicken us. See the best help for bad memories, namely, good affections; and though the exact words be lost, if the meaning remain, that is well. I am thine, not my own, not the world's; save me from sin, save me from ruin. The Lord will keep the man in peace, whose mind is stayed on him. It is poor perfection which one sees and end of. Such are all things in this world, which pass for perfections. The glory of man is but as the flower of the grass. The psalmist had seen the fulness of the word of God, and its sufficiency. The word of the Lord reaches to all cases, to all times. It will take us from all confidence in man, or in our own wisdom, strength, and righteousness. Thus shall we seek comfort and happiness from Christ alone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They continue this day according to thine ordinances - According to thy judgments (Hebrew); that is, thy commands.

That is, the heavens and the earth do, before mentioned, just as they were from the beginning of the creation. The heavenly bodies have the same motion, magnitude, distance, and influence; the sun rises and sets as it did; the moon keeps her appointed seasons of full and change, of increase and decrease; the fixed stars retain their place, and the planets have their exact revolutions: and on earth things are as they were; seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night; thus they are at this day, and will continue, according to the wise order and appointment of God. Aben Ezra and Kimchi interpret it, <p>"they stand or continue unto this day to do the will of God; to execute his judgments and decrees, or observe his order and ordinances.'' <p>for all are thy servants; or "they", or "these all" (a); the heavens and earth, and all that is in them, all the works of God; he called them into being, and they rose up at his command; he calls them to service, and they stand up as obedient ones to do his will; he "commandeth the sun, and it riseth not" before its time; and "he sealeth up the stars", that they shine not when he pleases; once he commanded the sun to stand still on Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, and they obeyed him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>. Hence it appears that the hosts of heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, ought not to be served and worshipped; but the Lord, the Maker of them, only, since they are his servants; and that men ought surely to serve the Lord, if these do, and especially such who are his chosen, redeemed, and called ones. <p>(a) "illa omnia", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "universa haec", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all <i>are</i> thy servants.</span><p>(b) Seeing the earth and all creatures remain in that estate in which you have created them, much more your truth remains constant and unchangeable.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">91</span>.

This strengthening according to God's promise is his earnest desire (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;) now, when within a very little his enemies have compassed his ruin (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). His soul and eyes languish (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>) for God's salvation, that it may be unto him according to God's word or promise, that this word may be fulfilled. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-83.htm">Psalm 119:83</a> &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is hypothetical, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-12.htm">Psalm 21:12</a> and frequently; here, as perhaps also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>, in the sense of "although" (Ew. &#1431;362, b). He does not suffer anything to drive God's word out of his mind, although he is already become like a leathern bottle blackened and shrivelled up in the smoke. The custom of the ancients of placing jars with wine over the smoke in order to make the wine prematurely old, i.e., to mellow it (vid., Rosenm&#1516;ller), does not yield anything towards the understanding of this passage: the skin-bottle that is not intended for present use is hung up on high; and the fact that it had to withstand the upward ascending smoke is intelligible, notwithstanding the absence of any mention of the chimney. The point of comparison, in which we agree for the most part with Hitzig, is the removal of him who in his dungeon is continually exposed to the drudgery of his persecutors. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-84.htm">Psalm 119:84</a> is equivalent to "how few." Our life here below is short, so also is the period within which the divine righteousness can reveal itself. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (instead of which the lxx erroneously reads &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;), pits, is an old word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>. The relative clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-85.htm">Psalm 119:85</a>, describes the "proud" as being a contradiction to the revealed law; for there was no necessity for saying that to dig a pit for others is not in accordance with this law. All God's commandments are an emanation of His faithfulness, and therefore too demand faithfulness; but it is just this faithfulness that makes the poet an object of deadly hatred. They have already almost destroyed him"in the land." It is generally rendered "on earth;" but "in heaven" at the beginning of the following octonary is too far removed to be an antithesis to it, nor does it sound like one (cf. on the other hand &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; ouranoi's, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>). It is therefore: in the land (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-9.htm">Psalm 73:9</a>), where they think they are the only ones who have any right there, they have almost destroyed him, without shaking the constancy of his faith. But he stands in need of fresh grace in order that he may not, however, at last succumb. </body></html>
