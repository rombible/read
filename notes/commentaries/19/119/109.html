But David considered himself as being peculiarly in danger, because, as he says in the next verse, <span class="ital">the wicked had laid a snare for </span>him — Intending, probably, Saul and his courtiers, who were unwearied in their endeavours to get him into their power, that they might take away his life. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>119:105-112 The word of God directs us in our work and way, and a dark place indeed the world would be without it. The commandment is a lamp kept burning with the oil of the Spirit, as a light to direct us in the choice of our way, and the steps we take in that way. The keeping of God's commands here meant, was that of a sinner under a dispensation of mercy, of a believer having part in the covenant of grace. The psalmist is often afflicted; but with longing desires to become more holy, offers up daily prayers for quickening grace. We cannot offer any thing to God, that he will accept but what he is pleased to teach us to do. To have our soul or life continually in our hands, implies constant danger of life; yet he did not forget God's promises nor his precepts. Numberless are the snares laid by the wicked; and happy is that servant of God, whom they have not caused to err from his Master's precepts. Heavenly treasures are a heritage for ever; all the saints accept them as such, therefore they can be content with little of this world. We must look for comfort only in the way of duty, and that duty must be done. A good man, by the grace of God, brings his heart to his work, then it is done well.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My soul is continually in my hand - The Septuagint renders this, "My soul is always in thy hands," but the Hebrew will not admit of this construction. The idea in the original is that his soul - his life - was always in jeopardy. The expression seems to be proverbial. Anything taken in the hand is liable to be rudely snatched away. Thus a casket of jewels, or a purse of gold in the hand, may at any moment be seized by robbers. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>. The meaning here is, that his life was constantly in danger.<p>Yet do I not forget thy law - Notwithstanding the danger to which I am exposed, and the care necessary to defend my life, I do not allow my mind to be turned from meditating on thy law, nor do I suffer any danger to deter me from obeying it.

The poet praises the practical wisdom which the word of God, on this very account so sweet to him, teaches. God's precious law, with which he unceasingly occupies himself, makes him superior in wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>), intelligence, and judgment to his enemies, his teachers, and the aged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-20.htm">Job 12:20</a>). There were therefore at that time teachers and elders (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), who (like the Hellenizing Sadducees) were not far from apostasy in their laxness, and hostilely persecuted the young and strenuous zealot for God's law. The construction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-98.htm">Psalm 119:98</a> is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-12.htm">Isaiah 59:12</a>, and frequently. &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; refers to the commandments in their unity: he has taken possession of them for ever (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a>).
