We ought to spend our lives in his service; we shall find true life in keeping his word. Those that would see the wondrous things of God's law and gospel, must beg him to give them understanding, by the light of his Spirit. Believers feel themselves strangers on earth; they fear missing their way, and losing comfort by erring from God's commandments. Every sanctified soul hungers after the word of God, as food which there is no living without. There is something of pride at the bottom of every wilful sin. God can silence lying lips; reproach and contempt may humble and do us good, and then they shall be removed. Do we find the weight of the cross is above that we are able to bear? He that bore it for us will enable us to bear it; upheld by him we cannot sink. It is sad when those who should protect the innocent, are their betrayers. The psalmist went on in duty, and he found comfort in the word of God. The comforts of the word of God are most pleasant to a gracious soul, when other comforts are made bitter; and those that would have God's testimonies to be their delight, must be advised by them. May the Lord direct us in exercising repentance of sin, and faith in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Princes also did sit and speak against me - This would have been applicable to David many times in his life, but it was also applicable to many others, and there is nothing in the language which would limit it to David. It is evident that the author of the psalm had been subject to reproach from those who were of exalted rank; it is clear also that he felt this keenly. It is natural, whether proper or not, that we should feel the reproach and contempt of those in elevated life - the rich, the honored, the learned - more than of those in humbler life. Their good opinion can be of value only as they may be better qualified than others to judge of what constitutes true excellence, or as they may have it in their power to do us more harm, or to do more to aid us in doing good, than others have; but truth and principle are never to be sacrificed that we may secure their favor; and if, in the faithful discharge of our duty, and the zealous adherence to the principles of our religion, we incur their frowns, we are to bear it - as the great Lord and Saviour of his people did. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>.<p>But thy servant did meditate in thy statutes - I was engaged in this; I continued to do it; I was not deterred from it by their opposition; I found comfort in it, when they sat and talked against me. This would seem to have reference to some occasion when they were together - in public business, or in the social circle. They, the princes and nobles engaged in the ordinary topics of conversation, or in conversation connected with revelry, frivolity, or sin. Unwilling to participate in this - having different tastes - feeling that it was improper to be one of their companions in such a mode of spending time, or in such subjects of conversation, "he" withdrew, he turned his thoughts on the law of God, he sought comfort in meditation on that law and on God. He became, therefore, the subject of remark - perhaps of their jests - "because" he thus refused to mingle with them, or because he put on what seemed to be hypocritical seriousness, and was (what they deemed) stern, sour, unsocial, as if he thus publicly, though tacitly, meant to rebuke them. Nothing will be more "likely" to subject one to taunting remarks, to rebuke, to contempt, than to manifest a religious spirit, and to introduce religion in any way in the circles of the worldly and the frivolous. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21-24.

The princes in the court of Saul, who suggested to him that David sought his hurt; the princes of his own court, Absalom, his own son, a prince of the blood, and Ahithophel, a counsellor of state: or the princes of the Gentiles, as Jarchi; so the princes of the Philistines spake against him in a very disdainful manner, "make this fellow return to his place again", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4</a>.

The T&#1508;ra beneath the surface of its letter contains an abundance of such "wondrous things," into which only eyes from which God has removed the covering of natural short-sightedness penetrate; hence the prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>. Upon earth we have no abiding resting-place, we sojourn here as in a strange land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>). Hence the poet prays in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a> that God would keep His commandments, these rules of conduct for the journey of life, in living consciousness for him. Towards this, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-20.htm">Psalm 119:20</a>, his longing tends. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; (Hiph. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16</a>) signifies to crush in pieces, Arab. jrs&#780;, and here, like the Aramaic &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, to be crushed, broken in pieces. &#1500;&#1514;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492; (from &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-40.htm">Psalm 119:40</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-174.htm">Psalm 119:174</a>, a secondary form of &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;) states the bias of mind in or at which the soul feels itself thus overpowered even to being crushed: it is crushing form longing after God's judgment, viz., after a more and more thorough knowledge of them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a> the lxx has probably caught the meaning of the poet better than the pointing has done, inasmuch as it draws &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a>, so that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a> consists of two words, just like <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>; and Kamphausen also follows this in his rendering.
