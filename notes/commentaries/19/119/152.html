Whither should the child go but to his father? Save me from my sins, my corruptions, my temptations, all the hinderances in my way, that I may keep thy testimonies. Christians who enjoy health, should not suffer the early hours of the morning to glide away unimproved. Hope in God's word encourages us to continue in prayer. It is better to take time from sleep, than not to find time for prayer. We have access to God at all hours; and if our first thoughts in the morning are of God, they will help to keep us in his fear all the day long. Make me lively and cheerful. God knows what we need and what is good for us, and will quicken us. If we are employed in God's service, we need not fear those who try to set themselves as far as they can out of the reach of the convictions and commands of his law. When trouble is near, God is near. He is never far to seek. All his commandments are truth. And God's promises will be performed. All that ever trusted in God have found him faithful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Concerning thy testimonies - In regard to all that thou hast testified to as true and best. Every command of God is in fact a testimony of his as to what is right; every promise is a testimony of his own purpose in regard to mankind.<p>I have known of old - The word used here is a noun, and means properly, "the front," what is "before;" then, the East; then, what pertains to olden time or ancient days - "before" the present. The meaning here is, that he had known this "before" what had now occurred; it was not a new thing - a new experience. It was deeply impressed on his mind as the result of all his reflection and observation.<p>That thou hast founded them for ever - "From" eternity, and "for" eternity. They were laid in the eternity past; they will continue in the eternity to come. They are based on eternal principles of right; they will never be changed. Such a conviction will do much to keep the soul steady and firm in the trials and uncertainties of life. Whatever may change, God's law does not change; whatever is new, that is not new; whatever will vanish away, that will remain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>150-152.

Or, "from thy testimonies, I have known of old" (d): by carefully reading the Scriptures which testify of God, his mind an will, and frequently meditating on them, he had learned a long time ago, even from his youth, what follows, <p>that thou hast founded them for ever; that the things contained in them are sure and certain, established and eternal truths; the moral law and the precepts of it are eternal, and of perpetual obligation; not one jot or tittle of them shall ever fail; the Gospel, and the truths of it, are everlasting, and shall ever remain; in spite of all the opposition, craft and cunning, fury and force of men, to undermine and root them out; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>. <p>(d) "ex obtestationibus tuis", Tigurine version; so Cocceius, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.</span><p>(d) His faith is grounded on God's word, that he would always be at hand when his children are oppressed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">152</span>. Of old have I known from thy testimonies, that &c. (R.V.). Men may affirm or act as if they believed that God’s laws are obsolete: but from the study of those laws themselves the Psalmist has long ago learnt their eternal validity; and his deeply rooted convictions cannot be shaken by the contempt or the threats of his enemies.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 152.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them forever</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from thy testimonies</span>. The study of God's commandments has long ago convinced the psalmist that they are no passing or temporary enactments, but eternal laws, decreed and laid down forever. The "testimonies" spoken of are, of course, the moral precepts of the Law, not its economical or political enactments. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/119.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The eightfold Koph. Fidelity to God's word, and deliverance according to His promise, is the purport of his unceasing prayer. Even in the morning twilight (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;) he was awake praying.

Instead of &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; the Ker (Targum, Syriac, Jerome) more appropriately reads &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-74.htm">Psalm 119:74</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-114.htm">Psalm 119:114</a>.
