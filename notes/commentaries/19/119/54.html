He that by his Spirit works faith in us, will work for us. The word of God speaks comfort in affliction. If, through grace, it makes us holy, there is enough in it to make us easy, in all conditions. Let us be certain we have the Divine law for what we believe, and then let not scoffers prevail upon us to decline from it. God's judgments of old comfort and encourage us, for he is still the same. Sin is horrible in the eyes of all that are sanctified. Ere long the believer will be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. In the mean time, the statutes of the Lord supply subjects for grateful praise. In the season of affliction, and in the silent hours of the night, he remembers the name of the Lord, and is stirred up to keep the law.

Here, says the psalmist, I sang. I found joy in these scenes by thinking on the pure law - the pure and holy truth of God.

Arab. charu&#770;f, a lamb  equals  a plucker of leaves or grass), but will be able to answer him on the ground of his own experience. The verb &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, which in itself has many meanings, acquires the signification "to give an answer" through the word, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, that is added (synon. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43</a> also refers to the duty of confessing God. The meaning of the prayer is, that God may not suffer him to come to such a pass that he will be utterly unable to witness for the truth; for language dies away in the mouth of him who is unworthy of its before God. The writer has no fear of this for himself, for his hope is set towards God's judgments (&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1498;, defective plural, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-149.htm">Psalm 119:149</a>; in proof of which, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-156.htm">Psalm 119:156</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-175.htm">Psalm 119:175</a>), his confidence takes its stand upon them.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-46.htm">Psalm 119:46</a> the Vulgate renders: Et loquebar de (in) testimoniis tuis in conspectu regum et non confundebar - the motto of the Augsburg Confession, to which it was adapted especially in connection with this historical interpretation of the two verbs, which does not correspond to the original text. The lifting up of the hands in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-48.htm">Psalm 119:48</a> is an expression of fervent longing desire, as in connection with prayer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, and frequently.
