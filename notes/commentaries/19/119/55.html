He that by his Spirit works faith in us, will work for us. The word of God speaks comfort in affliction. If, through grace, it makes us holy, there is enough in it to make us easy, in all conditions. Let us be certain we have the Divine law for what we believe, and then let not scoffers prevail upon us to decline from it. God's judgments of old comfort and encourage us, for he is still the same. Sin is horrible in the eyes of all that are sanctified. Ere long the believer will be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. In the mean time, the statutes of the Lord supply subjects for grateful praise. In the season of affliction, and in the silent hours of the night, he remembers the name of the Lord, and is stirred up to keep the law. All who have made religion the first thing, will own that they have been unspeakable gainers by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have remembered thy name, O Lord, in the night ... - I have thought on thee in the night, when on my bed; I have done it in the night of calamity and sorrow.

God's word is his hope and his trust amidst all derision; and when he burns with indignation at the apostates, God's word is his solace. Since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-49.htm">Psalm 119:49</a> the expression is not &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; but &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, it is not to be interpreted according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-3.htm">Psalm 98:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-45.htm">Psalm 106:45</a>, but: remember the word addressed to Thy servant, because Thou hast made me hope (Piel causat. as e.g., &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, to cause to forget, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-51.htm">Genesis 41:51</a>), i.e., hast comforted me by promising me a blessed issue, and hast directed my expectation thereunto. This is his comfort in his dejected condition, that God's promissory declaration has quickened him and proved its reviving power in his case. In &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;), ludificantur, it is implied that the &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; eht taht d are just &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, frivolous persons, libertines, free-thinkers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-52.htm">Psalm 119:52</a>, are the valid, verified decisions (judgments) of God revealed from the veriest olden times. In the remembrance of these, which determine the lot of a man according to the relation he holds towards them, the poet found comfort. It can be rendered: then I comforted myself; or according to a later usage of the Hithpa.: I was comforted. Concerning &#1494;&#1500;&#1506;&#1508;&#1492;, aestus, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, and on the subject-matter, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-104.htm">Psalm 119:104</a>. The poet calls his earthly life "the house of his pilgrimage;" for it is true the earth is man's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-16.htm">Psalm 115:16</a>), but he has no abiding resting-place there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>), his &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>) is elsewhere (vid., supra, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>). God's statutes are here his "songs," which give him spiritual refreshing, sweeten the hardships of the pilgrimage, and measure and hasten his steps. The Name of God has been in his mind hitherto, not merely by day, but also by night; and in consequence of this he has kept God's law (&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as five times besides in this Psalm, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>, and to be distinguished from &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-44.htm">Psalm 119:44</a>). Just this, that he keeps (observat) God's precepts, has fallen to his lot. To others something else is allotted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), to him this one most needful thing. </body></html>
