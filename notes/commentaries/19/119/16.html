The ruin of the young is either living by no rule at all, or choosing false rules: let them walk by Scripture rules. To doubt of our own wisdom and strength, and to depend upon God, proves the purpose of holiness is sincere. God's word is treasure worth laying up, and there is no laying it up safe but in our hearts, that we may oppose God's precepts to the dominion of sin, his promises to its allurements, and his threatenings to its violence. Let this be our plea with Him to teach us his statutes, that, being partakers of his holiness, we may also partake of his blessedness. And those whose hearts are fed with the bread of life, should with their lips feed many. In the way of God's commandments there is the unsearchable riches of Christ. But we do not meditate on God's precepts to good purpose, unless our good thoughts produce good works. I will not only think of thy statutes, but do them with delight. And it will be well to try the sincerity of our obedience by tracing the spring of it; the reality of our love by cheerfulness in appointed duties.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will delight myself in thy statutes - I will find my happiness in thy laws.

Acting in accordance with the word of God, a young man walks blamelessly; the poet desires this, and supplicates God's gracious assistance in order to it. To purify or cleanse one's way or walk (&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-9.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a>) signifies to maintain it pure (&#1494;&#1498;, root &#1494;&#1498;, Arab. zk, to prick, to strike the eye, nitere; <p>(Note: The word receives the meaning of &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; (vid., supra, p. 367), like Arab. d&#817;hr and bhr, from the signification of outshining  equals  overpowering.) <p>vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chaldisches Wrterbuch, i. 424) from the spotting of sin, or to free it from it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9</a> is the answer to the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9</a>; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; signifies custodiendo semetipsum, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; can also signify "to be on one's guard" without &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18</a>).

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-12.htm">Psalm 119:12</a> the poet makes his way through adoration to petition. &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-13.htm">Psalm 119:13</a> does not mean enumeration, but recounting, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>. &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; is the plural to &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, on the contrary, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-138.htm">Psalm 119:138</a> is the plural to &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;: both are used of God's attestation of Himself and of His will in the word of revelation. &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; signifies, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-162.htm">Psalm 119:162</a>, "as over" (short for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;), not: as it were more than (Olshausen); the &#1499;&#1468; would only be troublesome in connection with this interpretation.
