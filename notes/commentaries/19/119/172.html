He desired to know more of God in Christ; to know more of the doctrines of the word, and the duties of religion. He had a deep sense of unworthiness, and holy fear that his prayer should not come before God; Lord, what I pray for is, what thou hast promised. We have learned nothing to purpose, if we have not learned to praise God. We should always make the word of God the rule of our discourse, so as never to transgress it by sinful speaking, or sinful silence. His own hands are not sufficient, nor can any creature lend him help; therefore he looks up to God, that the hand that had made him may help him. He had made religion his deliberate choice. There is an eternal salvation all the saints long for, and therefore they pray that God would help their way to it. Let thy judgments help me; let all ordinances and all providences, (both are God's judgments,) further me in glorifying God; let them help me for that work. He often looks back with shame and gratitude to his lost estate. He still prays for the tender care of Him who purchased his flock with his own blood, that he may receive from him the gift of eternal life. Seek me, that is, Find me; for God never seeks in vain. Turn me, and I shall be turned. Let this psalm be a touchstone by which to try our hearts, and our lives. Do our hearts, cleansed in Christ's blood, make these prayers, resolutions and confessions our own? Is God's word the standard of our faith, and the law of our practice? Do we use it as pleas with Christ for what we need? Happy those who live in such delightful exercises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My tongue shall speak of thy word - It shall speak of it in the language of praise; it shall speak of it in making it known to others.<p>For all thy commandments are righteousness - I see this; I feel it; and, therefore, I will speak of it.

Of the word of God in general; of the truth of it, which he knew by certain experience; of the purity of it, tending to promote holiness of heart and life; of the power and efficacy of it, enlightening his mind, and working effectually in him; of the profit of it, to his learning, to his instruction, comfort, and refreshment; of the preciousness of it, being of more worth than thousands of gold and silver; and of the pleasantness of it, being sweeter than the honey or honeycomb, and more to be esteemed than one's necessary food; and of the promises of it in particular, of the worth and value of them, of their suitableness and use, and of the faithful fulfilment of them; and of the doctrines of the word, especially those which relate to the grace of God, and salvation by the Messiah; and also of the precepts of the word, as follows: <p>for all thy commandments are righteousness; not only righteous, but righteousness itself, being strictly just and equitable in the highest sense; and not only some of them, but all of them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-128.htm">Psalm 119:128</a>. Aben Ezra's paraphrase of the words is, <p>"I will teach the children of men thy word, that they may know that thy commandments are righteousness;'' <p>which is not amiss: and to the same sense is Kimchi's note, who observes, that author of the Masorah interprets it of praise; as if he had said, My tongue shall praise thy word, because all of it is righteousness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 172.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My tongue shall speak of thy Word</span>; or, "let my tongue respond to thy promise " - return praise, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>., for the fulfillment of thy promise. <span class="cmt_word">For all thy commandments are righteousness</span>.

Princes persecute him without adequate cause, but his heart does not fear before them, but before God's words (the Ker likes the singular, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-147.htm">Psalm 119:147</a>), to deny which would be to him the greatest possible evil. It is, however, a fear that is associated with heartfelt joy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a>). It is the joy of a conflict that is rewarded by rich spoil (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>). Not merely morning and evening, not merely three times a day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a>), but seven times (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>), i.e., ever again and again, availing himself of every prayerful impulse, he gives thanks to God for His word, which so righteously decides and so correctly guides, is a source of transcendent peace to all who love it, and beside which one is not exposed to any danger of stumbling (&#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;, lxx &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-10.htm">1 John 2:10</a>) without some effectual counter-working.

He endeavours to keep God's law most conscientiously, in proof of which he is able to appeal to God the Omniscient One. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; is here the 3rd praet., whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a> it is imperat.
