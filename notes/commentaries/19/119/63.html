The psalmist prayed with his whole heart, knowing how to value the blessing he prayed for: he desired the mercy promised, and depended on the promise for it. He turned from by-paths, and returned to God's testimonies. He delayed not. It behoves sinners to hasten to escape; and the believer will be equally in haste to glorify God. No care or grief should take away God's word out of our minds, or hinder the comfort it bestows. There is no situation on earth in which a believer has not cause to be thankful. Let us feel ashamed that others are more willing to keep from sleep to spend the time in sinful pleasures, than we are to praise God. And we should be more earnest in prayer, that our hearts may be filled with his mercy, grace, and peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am a companion of all them that fear thee - I find my associates and friends among those who worship thee; not with the profane and the wicked. "A man is known by the company that he keeps;" and it is an evidence of piety when we seek our companions and friends among the pious. It shows where the heart is; what the preferences are; what are the tastes; what is the real condition of the soul. We seek our friends in accordance with our tastes and preferences; our love to God is indicated by our love to his friends. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-21.htm">Psalm 139:21-22</a>.<p>And of them that keep thy precepts - That obey thy law. On the sentiment here, compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. A man may determine much in regard to his own character by asking himself what is the character of his chosen friends and companions. A member of a church should regard it as a dark sign against himself in regard to his piety, if his chosen friends are taken from the world, and not from the professed friends of God; if he finds more pleasure in their society, and in the scenes where they meet, than he does in the society of Christians however humble, or in places where they assemble for prayer and praise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>63.

Not of the rich and mighty, much less of the wicked and ungodly; but of such who had the true fear of God upon their hearts, and before their eyes; who feared the Lord and his goodness, and truly served and worshipped him; even "all" of these, whether poor or rich, of whatsoever condition, or of whatsoever nation, being no respecter of persons. With these he was a partner in the blessings of the covenant, in the promises of it, in the graces of the Spirit, and in a right and meetness for the same eternal glory and happiness: he went in company with them to the house of God, and joined with them in all acts of religious worship; he conversed privately with them about what God had done for the souls of him and them; he delighted in their company; he sympathized with them in their troubles; and was a companion with them in their tribulation, sorrows, and sufferings, as well as in their joys and comforts; <p>and of them that keep thy precepts; as all such do who truly fear the Lord; for by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil, and cannot do those things that others do; cannot allow themselves in a wilful transgression of the divine precepts; but, influenced by the fear of God, observe and keep them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I <i>am</i> a <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> companion of all <i>them</i> that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</span><p>(d) Not only in mutual consent, but also with aid and help.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am a companion of all them that fear thee</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

To understand and to keep God's word is his portion, the object of his incessant praying and thanksgiving, the highest grace or favour that can come to him. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>, the words &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1497; &#1492; belong together. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a> is an inference drawn from it (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm">Exodus 2:14</a>, and frequently), and the existing division of the verse is verified. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a>, is an expression of caressing, flattering entreaty; in Latin, caput mulcere (demulcere). His turning to the word of God the poet describes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a> as a result of a careful trying of his actions. After that he quickly and cheerfully, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>, determined to keep it without any long deliberation with flesh and blood, although the snares of wicked men surround him. The meaning of &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; is determined according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-110.htm">Psalm 119:110</a> : the pointing does not distinguish so sharply as one might have expected between &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, snares, bonds (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>.); but the plural nowhere, according to the usage of the language as we now have it, signifies bands (companies), from the singular in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a> (Bttcher, 800). Thankfulness urges him to get up at midnight (acc. temp. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a>) to prostrate himself before God and to pray. Accordingly he is on friendly terms with, he is closely connected with (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-24.htm">Proverbs 28:24</a>), all who fear God. Out of the fulness of the loving-kindness of God, which is nowhere unattested upon earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-64.htm">Psalm 119:64</a>  equals  <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-5.htm">Psalm 33:5</a>), he implores for himself the inward teaching concerning His word as the highest and most cherished of mercies. </body></html>
