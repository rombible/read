We ought to spend our lives in his service; we shall find true life in keeping his word. Those that would see the wondrous things of God's law and gospel, must beg him to give them understanding, by the light of his Spirit. Believers feel themselves strangers on earth; they fear missing their way, and losing comfort by erring from God's commandments. Every sanctified soul hungers after the word of God, as food which there is no living without. There is something of pride at the bottom of every wilful sin. God can silence lying lips; reproach and contempt may humble and do us good, and then they shall be removed. Do we find the weight of the cross is above that we are able to bear? He that bore it for us will enable us to bear it; upheld by him we cannot sink. It is sad when those who should protect the innocent, are their betrayers. The psalmist went on in duty, and he found comfort in the word of God. The comforts of the word of God are most pleasant to a gracious soul, when other comforts are made bitter; and those that would have God's testimonies to be their delight, must be advised by them. May the Lord direct us in exercising repentance of sin, and faith in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Open thou mine eyes - Margin, "Reveal." So the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. The Hebrew word means to be naked; then to make naked, to uncover, to disclose, to reveal. Here it is the same as "uncover;" that is, take away from the eyes what is before them to prevent clear vision. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-31.htm">Numbers 22:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a>.<p>That I may behold wondrous things - Things which are suited to excite wonder and amazement: that is, things which are secret or hidden from the common view; the deep, spiritual meaning of the word of God. By natural vision he might see the surface - the letter; to see the deep, hidden, real, meaning, he needed the special influence of God. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14-15</a>. He believed that there were such things in the law of God; he desired to see them.<p>Out of thy law - Out of the written word; out of the Scriptures. The word "law" here is used to denote "all" that God had revealed to mankind; all that is contained in the volume of inspiration. The truths taught here are<p>(1) That there are deep, hidden, secret things in the word of God, which are not perceived by the natural man;<p>(2) That those things, when understood, are suited to excite wonder, or to fill the mind with admiring views of God;<p>(3) That a special illumination of God is necessary that man may perceive these things; and<p>(4) That the proper understanding of these things is connected with prayer, and can be hoped for only in answer to prayer.<p>No one has a proper appreciation of divine truth - of the beauty, the spiritual meaning, the grandeur, the sublimity of the Bible - until he is a renewed - a praying - man.

The eyes of my heart or understanding, as Kimchi; or, "reveal mine eyes" (t); take off the veil from them: there is a veil of darkness and ignorance on the hearts of all men, with respect to divine and spiritual things; their understandings are darkened, yea, darkness itself. This veil must be removed; the scales must drop from their eyes; their eyes must be opened and enlightened, before they can discern spiritual things contained in the word of God; and even good men need to have the eyes of their understandings more and more enlightened into these things, as the psalmist here petitions, and the apostle prays for his Ephesians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <p>that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law; the law strictly taken, which had great and excellent things in it; and was wonderful for the compendiousness of it; for the justice, holiness, and equity of its precepts; especially for its spirituality, and above all for Christ, being the end of it; the two last more particularly could only be discerned by a spiritual man: or rather the five books of Moses, the almost only Scriptures extant in David's time, in which there were many wonderful things concerning Christ; some delivered by way of promise and prophecy of him, under the characters of the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, the Shiloh, and the great Prophet; and many others in dark figures, types, and shadows, which required a spiritual sight to look into; of which the rock and manna, the brasen serpent, passover, &amp;c. are instances: but rather, as the word "law" signifies "doctrine", the doctrine of the Gospel may be meant; which contains mysteries in it, respecting the trinity of Persons in the Godhead, the person of Christ, his incarnation, sufferings and death; the blessings of grace through him; the doctrines of peace, pardon, righteousness, eternal life, and the resurrection of the dead; with many others. <p>(t)  "revela oculos meos", Pagninus, Montanus, Musculus, Cocceius, Gejerus, Michaelis; "velamen detrahe oculis meis", Tigurine version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">Open</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">uncover</span>.

Acting in accordance with the word of God, a young man walks blamelessly; the poet desires this, and supplicates God's gracious assistance in order to it.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-12.htm">Psalm 119:12</a> the poet makes his way through adoration to petition. &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-13.htm">Psalm 119:13</a> does not mean enumeration, but recounting, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>. &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; is the plural to &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, on the contrary, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-138.htm">Psalm 119:138</a> is the plural to &#1506;&#1491;&#1492;: both are used of God's attestation of Himself and of His will in the word of revelation. &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; signifies, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-162.htm">Psalm 119:162</a>, "as over" (short for &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;), not: as it were more than (Olshausen); the &#1499;&#1468; would only be troublesome in connection with this interpretation.
