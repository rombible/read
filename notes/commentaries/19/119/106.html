The commandment is a lamp kept burning with the oil of the Spirit, as a light to direct us in the choice of our way, and the steps we take in that way. The keeping of God's commands here meant, was that of a sinner under a dispensation of mercy, of a believer having part in the covenant of grace. The psalmist is often afflicted; but with longing desires to become more holy, offers up daily prayers for quickening grace. We cannot offer any thing to God, that he will accept but what he is pleased to teach us to do. To have our soul or life continually in our hands, implies constant danger of life; yet he did not forget God's promises nor his precepts. Numberless are the snares laid by the wicked; and happy is that servant of God, whom they have not caused to err from his Master's precepts. Heavenly treasures are a heritage for ever; all the saints accept them as such, therefore they can be content with little of this world. We must look for comfort only in the way of duty, and that duty must be done. A good man, by the grace of God, brings his heart to his work, then it is done well.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have sworn - I have solemnly purposed; I have given to this purpose the solemnity and sanction of an oath. That is, I have called God to witness; I have formed the purpose in his presence, and with the consciousness that his eye is upon me. So all who make a profession of religion solemnly vow or swear. They do it in the house of God; they do it in the presence of the Discerner of hearts; they do it at the communion table; they do it at the family altar; they do it in the closet, when alone with God.<p>And I will perform it - Hebrew, I will establish it, or make it to stand. It shall not be a mere purpose. It shall be accomplished. This also is the resolution of all who make a true profession of religion. It is their intention - their solemn determination - to carry out that vow to its full accomplishment, always, and in every place, while life lasts, and forever. A man who makes a profession of religion, intending "not" to carry out what is fairly implied in such a profession, is a hypocrite. Unless there is a solemn purpose to keep the law of God, and always to keep it - to do what is fairly implied in a profession of religion, and always to do it - to defend the truth according to his best means of knowing it, and always to defend it - he cannot possibly be a sincere friend of God; he cannot be truly a religious man. He cannot be loyal to his country who designs to violate any one of its just laws; he cannot be an obedient child who intends to disobey the laws of a parent.<p>That I will keep thy righteous judgments - Not implying that there are any of the judgments of God which are not righteous, but meaning to characterize all his judgments or laws as righteous. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>106-108.

The poet praises the practical wisdom which the word of God, on this very account so sweet to him, teaches. God's precious law, with which he unceasingly occupies himself, makes him superior in wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>), intelligence, and judgment to his enemies, his teachers, and the aged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-20.htm">Job 12:20</a>). There were therefore at that time teachers and elders (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), who (like the Hellenizing Sadducees) were not far from apostasy in their laxness, and hostilely persecuted the young and strenuous zealot for God's law. The construction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-98.htm">Psalm 119:98</a> is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-12.htm">Isaiah 59:12</a>, and frequently. &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; refers to the commandments in their unity: he has taken possession of them for ever (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a>). The Mishna (Aboth iv. 1) erroneously interprets: from all my teachers do I acquire understanding. All three &#1502;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-98.htm">Psalm 119:98-100</a> signify prae (lxx &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1;).
