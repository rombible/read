The psalmist prayed with his whole heart, knowing how to value the blessing he prayed for: he desired the mercy promised, and depended on the promise for it. He turned from by-paths, and returned to God's testimonies. He delayed not. It behoves sinners to hasten to escape; and the believer will be equally in haste to glorify God. No care or grief should take away God's word out of our minds, or hinder the comfort it bestows. There is no situation on earth in which a believer has not cause to be thankful. Let us feel ashamed that others are more willing to keep from sleep to spend the time in sinful pleasures, than we are to praise God. And we should be more earnest in prayer, that our hearts may be filled with his mercy, grace, and peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I made haste - This language further describes the process of conversion. There was no delay; there was no excuse offered. He acted at once under his conviction of what was right. He did not ask permission to defer it to a future time; he did not attempt to avoid the duty; not plead inability; he did not give himself merely to the "use of means;" he did not rely on prayer, and reading, and reflection; but "he did the thing, and he did it at once." This is conversion; and if all convicted sinners would follow this example, and do at once that which they are commanded to do, and which they know they ought to do, there would be in no case any difficulty about conversion, for the main difficulty in conversion lies in the fact that the sinner is not willing to obey God at once; that he will not break away from his sins; that he endeavors to excuse himself; that he pleads for delay; that he waits for God to do what he himself ought to do.<p>And delayed not to keep thy commandments - I did not continue to go on in a course of sin, but I forsook my sin and obeyed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>59.

Men are apt to put off their repentance - to delay it to a more "convenient season" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>). The psalmist was not so foolish - he "made haste," he says; and <span class="cmt_word">delayed not to keep God's commandments</span>.

God's word is his hope and his trust amidst all derision; and when he burns with indignation at the apostates, God's word is his solace.

This is his comfort in his dejected condition, that God's promissory declaration has quickened him and proved its reviving power in his case. In &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;), ludificantur, it is implied that the &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; eht taht d are just &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, frivolous persons, libertines, free-thinkers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-52.htm">Psalm 119:52</a>, are the valid, verified decisions (judgments) of God revealed from the veriest olden times. In the remembrance of these, which determine the lot of a man according to the relation he holds towards them, the poet found comfort. It can be rendered: then I comforted myself; or according to a later usage of the Hithpa.: I was comforted. Concerning &#1494;&#1500;&#1506;&#1508;&#1492;, aestus, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, and on the subject-matter, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-104.htm">Psalm 119:104</a>. The poet calls his earthly life "the house of his pilgrimage;" for it is true the earth is man's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-16.htm">Psalm 115:16</a>), but he has no abiding resting-place there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>), his &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>) is elsewhere (vid., supra, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>). God's statutes are here his "songs," which give him spiritual refreshing, sweeten the hardships of the pilgrimage, and measure and hasten his steps. The Name of God has been in his mind hitherto, not merely by day, but also by night; and in consequence of this he has kept God's law (&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as five times besides in this Psalm, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>, and to be distinguished from &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-44.htm">Psalm 119:44</a>). Just this, that he keeps (observat) God's precepts, has fallen to his lot. To others something else is allotted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), to him this one most needful thing. </body></html>
