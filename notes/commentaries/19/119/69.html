Many have knowledge, but little judgment; those who have both, are fortified against the snares of Satan, and furnished for the service of God. We are most apt to wander from God, when we are easy in the world. We should leave our concerns to the disposal of God, seeing we know not what is good for us. Lord, thou art our bountiful Benefactor; incline our hearts to faith and obedience. The psalmist will go on in his duty with constancy and resolution. The proud are full of the world, and its wealth and pleasures; these make them senseless, secure, and stupid. God visits his people with affliction, that they may learn his statutes. Not only God's promises, but even his law, his percepts, though hard to ungodly men, are desirable, and profitable, because they lead us with safety and delight unto eternal life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The proud - The psalmist had before referred to the "proud" as those from whom he had suffered injury, or as having been exposed to their derision. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-51.htm">Psalm 119:51</a>. He here reverts to another form in which he had suffered from them.<p>Have forged a lie against me - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>. The word rendered "forged," means to patch together; and then it is applied to charges or accusations against anyone, perhaps from their being made up (as they often are) of shreds and patches - hints, small matters, things having no necessary connection in themselves, but brought together as if they pertained to the same transaction - words dropped here and there in conversation, which, being artfully woven together, seem to make out a plausible case against a man. Most slanders are formed and sustained in this way, for it is rare that an absolutely forged slander is uttered against a man, or that a charge is brought which cannot be made to have plausibility from such circumstances as those referred to above. Even the most pure and circumspect cannot always avoid this, for there is something in every man's life of which a malignant and cunning enemy may take advantage, and which he may weave into a story which some will believe, and which it may not be easy to confute. A malicious man may thus start a slander which may require years to correct, and which may even operate injuriously against a man all his life.<p>But I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart - Notwithstanding their accusations, and their attempts to turn me away from thee, or to represent me as false and hypocritical. Whatever they may do; whatever reports they may start to my disadvantage, it is my fixed purpose to obey entirely and always thy law.

To understand and to keep God's word is his portion, the object of his incessant praying and thanksgiving, the highest grace or favour that can come to him.

His turning to the word of God the poet describes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a> as a result of a careful trying of his actions.

The meaning of &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; is determined according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-110.htm">Psalm 119:110</a> : the pointing does not distinguish so sharply as one might have expected between &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, and &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;, snares, bonds (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>.); but the plural nowhere, according to the usage of the language as we now have it, signifies bands (companies), from the singular in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a> (Bttcher, 800).
