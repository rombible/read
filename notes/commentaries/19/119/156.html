Christ is the Advocate of his people, their Redeemer. Those who were quickened by his Spirit and grace, when they were dead in trespasses and sins, often need to have the work of grace revived in them, according to the word of promise. The wicked not only do not God's statutes, but they do not even seek them. They flatter themselves that they are going to heaven; but the longer they persist in sin, the further it is from them. God's mercies are tender; they are a fountain that can never be exhausted. The psalmist begs for God's reviving, quickening grace. A man, steady in the way of his duty, though he may have many enemies, needs to fear none. Those that hate sin truly, hate it as sin, as a transgression of the law of God, and a breaking of his word. Our obedience is only pleasing to God, and pleasant to ourselves, when it comes from a principle of love. All, in every age, who receive God's word in faith and love, find every saying in it faithful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord - They are many, or multiplied.

Instead of &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; the Ker (Targum, Syriac, Jerome) more appropriately reads &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-74.htm">Psalm 119:74</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-114.htm">Psalm 119:114</a>.

And the poet has long gained the knowledge from it that it does not aim at merely temporary recompense. The sophisms of the apostates cannot therefore lead him astray. &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; for &#1497;&#1505;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, like &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a>. </body></html>
