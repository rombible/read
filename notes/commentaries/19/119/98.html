All true wisdom is from God. A good man carries his Bible with him, if not in his hands, yet in his head and in his heart. By meditation on God's testimonies we understand more than our teachers, when we understand our own hearts. The written word is a more sure guide to heaven, than all the fathers, the teachers, and ancients of the church. We cannot, with any comfort or boldness, attend God in holy duties, while under guilt, or in any by-way. It was Divine grace in his heart, that enabled the psalmist to receive these instructions. The soul has its tastes as well as the body. Our relish for the word of God will be greatest, when that for the world and the flesh is least. The way of sin is a wrong way; and the more understanding we get by the precepts of God, the more rooted will be our hatred of sin; and the more ready we are in the Scriptures, the better furnished we are with answers to temptation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou, through thy commandments - By the teaching and power of thy law.<p>Hast made me wiser than mine enemies - I have a better understanding of thee, of thy law, of the duties of this life, and in regard to the life to come, than my enemies have - not because I am naturally better, or because I have higher endowments by nature, but because thou hast made me wiser than they are. The rendering of this first clause of the verse now most approved by interpreters is, "Thy commandments make me more wise than my enemies are," though this requires a singular verb to be construed with a plural noun (Professor Alexander). So DeWette renders it.<p>For they are ever with me - Margin, as in Hebrew, "it is ever with me." The reference is to the law or commandments of God. The meaning is, that that law was never out of his mind; that he was constantly thinking about it; and that it unfolded such wisdom to him as to make him superior to all his foes; to give him a better understanding of life, its design, its duties, and its obligations, than his enemies had. The best instructor in true wisdom is the revealed word of God - the Bible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>98-100. of knowledge, both of the matter of all useful, moral truth, and an experience of its application.<p>wiser than mine enemies&#8212;with all their carnal cunning (De 4:6, 8).<p>they are ever with me&#8212;The Hebrew is, rather singular, "it is ever with me"; the commandments forming ONE complete whole, Thy law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies, </span> because by that means I have thy wisdom to guide me, and thy power engaged to protect and save me; which is a more certain and effectual way to obtain my desires and ends than all the policy and craft of mine enemies is to hinder them, as I have found by experience.

David had his enemies, as every good man has: and these are often cunning and crafty ones, at least in wickedness; many of them are wise and prudent as to natural things, wiser in worldly things and political matters than the children of light, and often lay deep schemes and take crafty counsel against the saints; and yet they, by attending to the word and commands of God, and being under his direction and counsel, counterwork the designs of their enemies, and overturn their schemes and measures, which are brought to confusion; honesty being in the issue the best policy. However, the people of God are wiser than they in the best things; in the affair of salvation; in things relating to a future state, and their happiness there; which wisdom they attain unto through the Word of God, which is written for their learning; through the Scriptures, which are able to make men wise to salvation: these are the means, and no more; for it is God that is the efficient cause, or makes the means effectual, to make them wise, and wiser than others; it is owing to his divine teachings, to his Spirit and grace. The words may be rendered, "it hath made me wiser in thy commandments than mine enemies" (d); that is, the law; and so is another reason why it was so greatly loved by him: or, "thy commandments", that is, everyone of thy commandments, "have made me wiser", &amp;c. (e). Joseph Kimchi give, this as the sense, <p>"by mine enemies thou hast made me wise (f); thou hast learned me thy commandments, so that I see they cannot remove thy law from my mouth;'' <p>for they are ever with me; that is, the commandments of God, or his law, and the precepts of it; they were his privy counsellors, with whom on all occasions he consulted, and so became wiser than his enemies, and outwitted them: these were always near him, in his heart and in his mouth; he was ever thinking and speaking of them, and so did not forget the instructions they gave him; they were ever before his eyes, as the rule of his conduct. <p>(d) So Junius &amp; Tremellius.

This law is his possession. Cp. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm" title="Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.">Psalm 119:111</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 98.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou through thy command-meets but made me wiser than mine enemies</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6, 8</a>). The knowledge of God's Law gives a wisdom and an understanding infinitely above the cunning and craft of worldly men.

Eternal and imperishable in the constant verifying of itself is the vigorous and consolatory word of God, to which the poet will ever cling. It has heaven as its standing-place, and therefore it also has the qualities of heaven, and before all others, heaven-like stability. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>) uses similar language in reference to God's faithfulness, of which here <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-90.htm">Psalm 119:90</a> says that it endureth into all generations. The earth hath He creatively set up, and it standeth, viz., as a practical proof and as a scene of His infinite, unchangeable faithfulness. Heaven and earth are not the subjects of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a> (Hupfeld), for only the earth is previously mentioned; the reference to the heavens in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a> is of a very different character. Hitzig and others see the subject in &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;: with respect to Thy judgments, they stand fast unto this day; but the &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498; which follows requires another meaning to be assigned to &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;: either of taking up one's place ready for service, or, since &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; is a current phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-24.htm">Ezekiel 44:24</a>, of placing one's self ready to obey (Bttcher). The subject of &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, as the following &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; shows, is meant to be thought of in the most general sense (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-14.htm">Job 38:14</a>): all beings are God's servants (subjects), and have accordingly to be obedient and humble before His judicial decisions - &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, "even to this day," the poet adds, for these judicial decisions are those which are formulated beforehand in the Tra. Joy in this ever sure, all-conditioning word has upheld the poet in his affliction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>.

He knows from experience that all (earthly) perfection (&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;) has an end (inasmuch as, having reached its height, it changes into its opposite); God's commandment (singular as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-22.htm">Deuteronomy 11:22</a>), on the contrary, is exceeding broad (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-9.htm">Job 11:9</a>), unlimited in its duration and verification. </body></html>
