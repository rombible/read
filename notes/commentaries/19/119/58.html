The psalmist prayed with his whole heart, knowing how to value the blessing he prayed for: he desired the mercy promised, and depended on the promise for it. He turned from by-paths, and returned to God's testimonies. He delayed not. It behoves sinners to hasten to escape; and the believer will be equally in haste to glorify God. No care or grief should take away God's word out of our minds, or hinder the comfort it bestows. There is no situation on earth in which a believer has not cause to be thankful. Let us feel ashamed that others are more willing to keep from sleep to spend the time in sinful pleasures, than we are to praise God. And we should be more earnest in prayer, that our hearts may be filled with his mercy, grace, and peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I entreated thy favor - Margin, as in Hebrew, "face."

God's word is his hope and his trust amidst all derision; and when he burns with indignation at the apostates, God's word is his solace.

This is his comfort in his dejected condition, that God's promissory declaration has quickened him and proved its reviving power in his case. In &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;), ludificantur, it is implied that the &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; eht taht d are just &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, frivolous persons, libertines, free-thinkers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-52.htm">Psalm 119:52</a>, are the valid, verified decisions (judgments) of God revealed from the veriest olden times. In the remembrance of these, which determine the lot of a man according to the relation he holds towards them, the poet found comfort. It can be rendered: then I comforted myself; or according to a later usage of the Hithpa.: I was comforted. Concerning &#1494;&#1500;&#1506;&#1508;&#1492;, aestus, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, and on the subject-matter, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-21.htm">Psalm 119:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-104.htm">Psalm 119:104</a>. The poet calls his earthly life "the house of his pilgrimage;" for it is true the earth is man's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-16.htm">Psalm 115:16</a>), but he has no abiding resting-place there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>), his &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>) is elsewhere (vid., supra, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-19.htm">Psalm 119:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm">Psalm 39:13</a>). God's statutes are here his "songs," which give him spiritual refreshing, sweeten the hardships of the pilgrimage, and measure and hasten his steps. The Name of God has been in his mind hitherto, not merely by day, but also by night; and in consequence of this he has kept God's law (&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, as five times besides in this Psalm, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>, and to be distinguished from &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-44.htm">Psalm 119:44</a>). Just this, that he keeps (observat) God's precepts, has fallen to his lot. To others something else is allotted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), to him this one most needful thing. </body></html>
