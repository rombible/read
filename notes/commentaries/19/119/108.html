The commandment is a lamp kept burning with the oil of the Spirit, as a light to direct us in the choice of our way, and the steps we take in that way. The keeping of God's commands here meant, was that of a sinner under a dispensation of mercy, of a believer having part in the covenant of grace. The psalmist is often afflicted; but with longing desires to become more holy, offers up daily prayers for quickening grace. We cannot offer any thing to God, that he will accept but what he is pleased to teach us to do. To have our soul or life continually in our hands, implies constant danger of life; yet he did not forget God's promises nor his precepts. Numberless are the snares laid by the wicked; and happy is that servant of God, whom they have not caused to err from his Master's precepts. Heavenly treasures are a heritage for ever; all the saints accept them as such, therefore they can be content with little of this world. We must look for comfort only in the way of duty, and that duty must be done. A good man, by the grace of God, brings his heart to his work, then it is done well.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Accept, I beseech thee, the free-will offerings of my mouth - Or, the meaning of the word here rendered "free-will," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>. It conveys the idea that there is no constraint or compulsion; that the offering is a prompting of the heart. The offering might be that of flour, or grain, or fruits, or property of any kind, as devoted to God; or it might be, as here, an offering of the lips, expressed in prayer and praise. Either of them might be acceptable to God; their being accepted in either case would depend on the good pleasure of God, and hence, the psalmist prays that his offering might be thus acceptable.

Praise is an offering more pleasing to God than an ox or bullock that has horns and hoofs, because it glorifies him; and it is a freewill offering when it is of a man's own accord, comes from his heart; when he calls upon his soul, and all within him, to bless the Lord: and as every good man is desirous of having his sacrifices accepted with the Lord, so they are accepted by him when offered up through Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>; <p>and teach me thy judgments; for though he was wiser than his enemies, and had more understanding than his teachers, or than the ancients; yet needed to be instructed more and more, and was desirous of being taught of God.

The poet praises the practical wisdom which the word of God, on this very account so sweet to him, teaches. God's precious law, with which he unceasingly occupies himself, makes him superior in wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>), intelligence, and judgment to his enemies, his teachers, and the aged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-20.htm">Job 12:20</a>). There were therefore at that time teachers and elders (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), who (like the Hellenizing Sadducees) were not far from apostasy in their laxness, and hostilely persecuted the young and strenuous zealot for God's law. The construction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-98.htm">Psalm 119:98</a> is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-12.htm">Isaiah 59:12</a>, and frequently. &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; refers to the commandments in their unity: he has taken possession of them for ever (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a>).
