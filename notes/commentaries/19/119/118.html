Aquila, “Thou hast impaled.” Symmachus, “Thou hast convicted.” Literally the word seems to mean to <span class= "ital">weigh </span>or <span class= "ital">value, </span>but, from the habit of the buyer beating down the price by depreciating, comes to have a sense of this kind.

He seems to speak of those proud persecutors who trampled upon God’s people, and on whom he saw that sooner or later God would trample<span class="ital">; for their deceit is falsehood — </span>All their crafty and deceitful devices, by which they design to insnare and ruin good men, shall deceive their expectations, and bring that destruction upon themselves which they designed for others. <span class="ital">Thou puttest away all the wicked — </span>Thou removest them from thy presence, from the society of thy people, and from the land of the living; <span class="ital">like dross — </span>Which, though for a season it be mixed with gold or silver, is not only separated from it, as a useless and contemptible thing, but also is utterly consumed by fire; <span class="ital">therefore I love thy testimonies</span> — Because they are the best preservatives against wickedness, and against those dreadful punishments attending upon it. Of these he professes his fear, adding, in the next verse, <span class="ital">My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, </span>&c. — As if he had said, The observation of thy terrible judgments against ungodly men, and the consciousness which I have of my own manifold sins and great weakness, make me fear lest thou shouldest punish me also, as thou justly mightest, if thou shouldest be so strict as to mark what is amiss in me; or lest I should partake with them in their sins, and consequently in their plagues.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>119:113-120 Here is a dread of the risings of sin, and the first beginnings of it. The more we love the law of God, the more watchful we shall be, lest vain thoughts draw us from what we love. Would we make progress in keeping God's commands, we must be separate from evil-doers. The believer could not live without the grace of God; but, supported by his hand, his spiritual life shall be maintained. Our holy security is grounded on Divine supports. All departure from God's statutes is error, and will prove fatal. Their cunning is falsehood. There is a day coming which will put the wicked into everlasting fire, the fit place for the dross.

Rather, "Thou hast made light of," or "thou despisest." The Hebrew word means properly to suspend in a balance; to weigh. Then it means to lift up lightly or easily; and then, to make light of; to contemn; to regard anything as "light." The Septuagint and Latin Vulgate render it, "Thou dost despise." That is, God regards them as of no account; as a light substance of no value; as chaff which the wind carries away. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>.<p>For their deceit is falsehood - This seems to be a truism - for deceit must imply falsehood. In the original this is an emphatic way of declaring the whole thing to be false, as the Hebrew language often expresses emphasis by mere repetition - thus "pits, pits," meaning many pits. The psalmist first characterizes their conduct as deceitful - as that which cannot be relied on - as that which must fail in the end; he then speaks of this system on which they acted as altogether a "lie" - as that which is utterly "false;" thus giving, as it were, a double emphasis to the statement, and showing how utterly delusive and vain it must be. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>118-120.

That wander from the way of the Lord's commandments; that deviate from his precepts, go astray constantly and wilfully; a people that err in their hearts, and with all their hearts. These the Lord treads down, as mire in the streets, as grapes in a winepress; which shows his abhorrence of them, his indignation at them, and how easily they are subdued under him; <p>for their deceit is falsehood: or, "their hypocrisy is a lie" (m): the appearance they make is a false one; they appear outwardly righteous, but are inwardly wicked; have a form of godliness, but deny the power of it: or all their deceitful doctrines are lies in hypocrisy, though dressed up with all the art and cunning they are masters of; or all their subtle schemes to corrupt and subvert the true doctrines of the word are in vain and to no purpose. <p>(m) So Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> deceit <i>is</i> falsehood.</span><p>(d) The crafty practises of them who contemn your law will be brought to nothing.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">118</span>. <span class="ital">Thou hast trodden down</span>] Rather, hast set at nought (R.V.), or hast rejected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for their deceit</span> is <span class="ital">falsehood</span>] Not, their crafty schemes are <span class="ital">vain</span> (R.V. marg.), doomed to be frustrated: but, the principles with which they deceive themselves and mislead others are false and baseless; therefore God rejects them.

The word of God is his constant guide, to which he has entrusted himself for ever. The way here below is a way through darkness, and leads close past abysses: in this danger of falling and of going astray the word of God is a lamp to his feet, i.e., to his course, and a light to his path (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>); his lamp or torch and his sun. That which he has sworn, viz., to keep God's righteous requirements, he has also set up, i.e., brought to fulfilment, but not without being bowed down under heavy afflictions in confessing God; wherefore he prays (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-25.htm">Psalm 119:25</a>) that God would revive him in accordance with His word, which promises life to those who keep it. The confessions of prayer coming from the inmost impulse of his whole heart, in which he owns his indebtedness and gives himself up entirely to God's mercy, he calls the free-will offerings of his mouth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-108.htm">Psalm 119:108</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-15.htm">Psalm 19:15</a>). He bases the prayer for a gracious acceptance of these upon the fact of his being reduced to extremity. "To have one's soul in one's hand" is the same as to be in conscious peril of one's life, just as "to take one's soul into one's hand" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-21.htm">1 Samuel 28:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a>) is the same as to be ready to give one's life for it, to risk one's life.<p>(Note: Cf. B. Taanth 8a: "The prayer of a man is not answered &#1488;&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1503; &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1493;, i.e., if he is not ready to sacrifice his life.")<p>Although his life is threatened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-87.htm">Psalm 119:87</a>), yet he does not waver and depart from God's word; he has taken and obtained possession of God's testimonies for ever (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-98.htm">Psalm 119:98</a>); they are his "heritage," for which he willingly gives up everything else, for they (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; inexactly for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;) it is which bless and entrance him in his inmost soul.
