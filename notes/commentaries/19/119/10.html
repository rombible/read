The ruin of the young is either living by no rule at all, or choosing false rules: let them walk by Scripture rules. To doubt of our own wisdom and strength, and to depend upon God, proves the purpose of holiness is sincere. God's word is treasure worth laying up, and there is no laying it up safe but in our hearts, that we may oppose God's precepts to the dominion of sin, his promises to its allurements, and his threatenings to its violence. Let this be our plea with Him to teach us his statutes, that, being partakers of his holiness, we may also partake of his blessedness. And those whose hearts are fed with the bread of life, should with their lips feed many. In the way of God's commandments there is the unsearchable riches of Christ. But we do not meditate on God's precepts to good purpose, unless our good thoughts produce good works. I will not only think of thy statutes, but do them with delight. And it will be well to try the sincerity of our obedience by tracing the spring of it; the reality of our love by cheerfulness in appointed duties.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With my whole heart have I sought thee - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-2.htm">Psalm 119:2</a>. The psalmist in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-2.htm">Psalm 119:2</a> speaks of the "blessedness of those who seek the Lord with the whole heart;" in this verse he says that this blessedness was his. He could affirm that he had thus sought God. He had such a consciousness that this was the aim and purpose of his life that he could say so without hesitation. Every man who claims to be a religious man ought to be able to say this. Alas, how few can do it!<p>O let me not wander ... - Keep me in this steady purpose; this fixed design. This is the language of a heart where there is a consciousness of its weakness, and its liability to err, strong as may be its purpose to do right. Such an apprehension is one of the best means of security, for such an apprehension will lead a man to "pray," and while a man prays he is safe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/119.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-16.

The character of the good man, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-2.htm">Psalm 119:2</a>; the psalmist applies to himself; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>; and uses it as an argument to obtain the following request: <p>O let me not wander from thy commandments; the way of them. Good men are apt to go astray, as David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a>; their hearts, their affections, and their feet, wander from, the way of their duty: there are many things which lead them aside, and cause them to turn to the right hand or the left, at least solicit them to do so; as a corrupt nature, an evil heart, a body of sin and death, the snares of the world, and the temptations of Satan; and, what is worst of all, when God leaves them to themselves, withdraws the influences of his grace, and brings them into such circumstances as expose them to going astray, which the psalmist here deprecates; "suffer me not to wander", but uphold my goings in thy ways; preserve me by thy grace, and keep me by thy power; hold me by thy right hand, and guide and direct me. Or, "cause me not to wander" (q) &amp;c. a like petition to those in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>; with which last Kimchi compares these words. <p>(q)  "ne errare facias me", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">’Orach</span>, ‘path,’ a poetical synonym for <span class="ital">derek</span>; not in Deut., but common in Prov.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">attributes</span> applied to the Law should also be studied. Like its Author (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-137.htm" title="Righteous are you, O LORD, and upright are your judgments.">Psalm 119:137</a></span>, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>) it is perfectly righteous. The note of righteousness is constantly repeated; in all its aspects the Law answers to that perfect standard which God is to Himself for all His works and words. Its faithfulness and truth correspond to the faithfulness and truth of His nature; it is sharply contrasted with all that is false in belief and conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Other constantly recurring expressions should also be noted. The Psalmist’s repeated protestations that he has ‘observed’ or ‘kept’ the law, his resolutions to do so, and his prayers for strength to fulfil them, answer to the repeated injunctions of Deut. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-2.htm" title="O you sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? how long will you love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.">Psalm 4:2</a> &c.). ‘With a (my) whole heart,’ with entire devotion of thought and will, is a phrase characteristic alike of this Psalm and of the Book of Deut.[80] (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm" title="But if from there you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm" title="And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> &c.) where it is often coupled with ‘the whole soul,’ the organ of feeling and emotion. In Deut. the Israelites are repeatedly exhorted to <span class="ital">learn</span> the statutes and judgements (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-1.htm" title="And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and keep, and do them.">Deuteronomy 5:1</a>) and to teach them to their children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm" title="Specially the day that you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>); and repeatedly the Psalmist prays that he may be taught. The Psalmist’s reiterated prayers for ‘understanding’ recall the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm" title="Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>. ‘Life’ is held out in Deut. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-1.htm" title="Now therefore listen, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.">Deuteronomy 4:1</a> &c.) as the reward of obedience; and for ‘life’ the Psalmist continually pleads—‘quicken thou me’—‘let me live’ (Psa 25, 37, 40, 88, 107, 149, 154, 156, 159, 116, 144). The source of ‘life’ he finds in the law and promises of God (50, 93): and by ‘life’ he means not simply preservation from death, but liberation from all, whether within or without, that crushes and paralyses life, and hinders its proper use and enjoyment; for ‘life’ includes the ideas of light and joy and prosperity. It finds its fullest realisation in communion with God. The original promise of life to the nation is coupled with the promise of the possession of the land, but the latter now drops out of sight, and the conception of ‘life’ is approximating towards the higher meaning of the word in the N.T. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm" title="And he humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man live.">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>. Very noteworthy is the Psalmist’s enthusiastic <span class="ital">love</span> for the Law. The love which the Israelite was bidden to cherish for Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm" title="And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> &c.) is kindled by the manifold revelation of His Will in the Law. “O how I love thy law: it is my meditation all the day” (97). It is no irksome restraint of his liberty, but his delight, his joy, his treasure, his comfort, the subject of his meditations by day and by night, the source of trust and hope amid all the perplexities and troubles of life. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[80] Deut. prefers the form <span class="ital">lçbâb</span>, the Psalm, except in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-7.htm" title="I will praise you with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned your righteous judgments.">Psalm 119:7</a></span>, uses <span class="ital">lçb</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10</span>.
