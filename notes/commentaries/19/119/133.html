The Scriptures show us what we were, what we are, and what we shall be. They show us the mercy and the justice of the Lord, the joys of heaven, and the pains of hell. Thus they give to the simple, in a few days, understanding of those matters, which philosophers for ages sought in vain. The believer, wearied with the cares of life and his conflicts with sin, pants for the consolations conveyed to him by means of the sacred word. And every one may pray, Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. We must beg that the Holy Spirit would order our steps. The dominion of sin is to be dreaded and prayed against by every one. The oppression of men is often more than flesh and blood can bear; and He who knoweth our frame, will not refuse to remove it in answer to the prayers of his people. Whatever obscurity may appear as to the faith of the Old Testament believers, their confidence at the throne of grace can only be explained by their having obtained more distinct views of gospel privileges, through the sacrifices and services of their law, than is generally imagined. Go to the same place, plead the name and merits of Jesus, and you will not, you cannot plead in vain. Commonly, where there is a gracious heart, there is a weeping eye. Accept, O Lord, the tears our blessed Redeemer shed in the days of his flesh, for us who should weep for our brethren or ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Order my steps in thy word - My goings, or, my conduct and life - by thy word; according to thy requirements.

The prayer is, that no form of sin, that no wicked passion or propensity, might be allowed to rule over him. He who is willing that any one sin should rule in his heart, though he should be free from all other forms of sin, cannot be a pious man.

But the parallel first clause in this (Ps 119:33) favors English Version (Ps 19:13). His hope of deliverance from external oppression of man (Ps 119:34) is founded on his deliverance from the internal "dominion of iniquity," in answer to his prayer (Ps 119:33).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/119.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 133. <span class="bld">Order my steps; </span> by thy grace direct and govern all my motions and actions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In thy word; </span> in the way prescribed in thy word; or, <span class="ital">by thy word</span>.

Or, "by thy word" (s), or "according" to it. Which is the rule of practice and action, as well as of faith; and happy are they who walk according to the directions of it; but it is not in the power of man to order and direct his steps: this is done by the Lord; and such who acknowledge him in their ways, and apply to him for direction, are and shall be thus favoured by him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>; <p>and let not any iniquity have dominion over me; not only greater sins or presumptuous ones, very gross iniquities, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>; but lesser ones, even the least of them. It is a sad thing to be enslaved to any lust or sin, be it what it will: sin reigns over wicked men even unto death; and it oftentimes has great power over good men, puts them upon doing that which is evil, and hinders them from doing that which is good; it carries them captive, and threatens to have the ascendant over them, and rule in them, which they deprecate; and such a prayer may be the prayer of faith, since it is promised "sin shall not have the dominion over you", <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14</a>.

In the present time of apostasy and persecution he keeps all the more strictly to the direction of the divine word, and commends himself to the protection and teaching of God. In the consciousness of his godly behaviour (elsewhere always &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, here in one instance &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; &#1493;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;) the poet hopes that God will surely not (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;) leave him to the arbitrary disposal of his oppressors. This hope does not, however, raise him above the necessity and duty of constant prayer that Jahve would place Himself between him and his enemies. &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; seq. acc. signifies to stand in any one's place as furnishing a guarantee, and in general as a mediator, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; similar to &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm">Psalm 86:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a> : in my behalf, for my real advantage. The expression of longing after redemption in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-123.htm">Psalm 119:123</a> sounds like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>. "The word of Thy righteousness" is the promise which proceeds from God's "righteousness," and as surely as He is "righteous" cannot remain unfulfilled. The one chief petition of the poet, however, to which he comes back in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-124.htm">Psalm 119:124</a>., has reference to the ever deeper knowledge of the word of God; for this knowledge is in itself at once life and blessedness, and the present calls most urgently for it. For the great multitude (which is the subject to &#1492;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;) practically and fundamentally break God's law; it is therefore time to act for Jahve (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm">Genesis 30:30</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a>), and just in order to this there is need of well-grounded, reliable knowledge. Therefore the poet attaches himself with all his love to God's commandments; to him they are above gold and fine gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>), which he might perhaps gain by a disavowal of them. Therefore he is as strict as he possibly can be with God's word, inasmuch as he acknowledges and observes all precepts of all things (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1500;), i.e., all divine precepts, let them have reference to whatsoever they will, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, right (&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;, to declare both in avowal and deed to be right); and every false (lying) tendency, all pseudo-Judaism, he hates. It is true <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-126.htm">Psalm 119:126</a> may be also explained: it is time that Jahve should act, i.e., interpose judicially; but this thought is foreign to the context, and affords no equally close union for &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503;; moreover it ought then to have been accented &#1506;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;.
