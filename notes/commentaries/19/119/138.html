The promises are faithfully performed by Him that made them. Zeal against sin should constrain us to do what we can against it, at least to do more in religion ourselves. Our love to the word of God is evidence of our love to God, because it is designed to make us partake his holiness. Men's real excellency always makes them low in their own eyes. When we are small and despised, we have the more need to remember God's precepts, that we may have them to support us. The law of God is the truth, the standard of holiness, the rule of happiness; but the obedience of Christ alone justifies the believer. Sorrows are often the lot of saints in this vale of tears; they are in heaviness through manifold temptations. There are delights in the word of God, which the saints often most sweetly enjoy when in trouble and anguish. This is life eternal, to know God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent, Joh 17:3. May we live the life of faith and grace here, and be removed to the life of glory hereafter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/119.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded - Thy law, considered as a testimony as to what is right and best.<p>Are righteous and very faithful - Margin, as in Hebrew, "righteousness and faithfulness."

So the sense is, Thou hast strictly and severely, under the highest obligations and penalties, commanded in thy word that men should be just and true in all their actions. And this agrees very well with the next foregoing verse, wherein he affirmed that God is righteous, and doth righteous things; and then here he adds that he requires righteousness and truth from all men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/119.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous,.... The Scriptures are holy, just, and good; and what is contained in them are according to godliness; are for instruction in righteousness, and teach men to live soberly, righteously, and godly; <p>and very faithful; or "true" (u): all the sayings in them are true and faithful sayings; for they are the sayings of God that cannot lie; the promises in them are faithfully performed by him that made them; they are all yea and amen in Christ. The words may be rendered, "thou hast commanded righteousness in thy testimonies, and truth" or faith "exceedingly": so the Arabic version. God in the law requires of men a perfect righteousness, every way agreeable to its demands; and in his Gospel he reveals the complete righteousness of his Son, which he has commanded to be published in it, to be laid hold on and received by faith as a justifying righteousness, as it is to all that believe: this, with every other truth of the Gospel, is made manifest by the Scriptures according to the commandment of the everlasting God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>. <p>(u)  "et verissimae", Vatablus, "veritas valde, i.e. prorsus verissima", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/119.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thy testimonies <i>that</i> thou hast commanded <i>are</i> <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> righteous and very faithful.</span><p>(a) We cannot confess God to be righteous, unless we live uprightly and truly as he has commanded.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/119.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">138</span>.

The deeper his depression of spirit concerning those who despise the word of God, the more ardently does he yearn after the light and food of that word. The testimonies of God are &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, wonderful and strange (paradoxical) things, exalted above every-day life and the common understanding. In this connection of the thoughts &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501; is not intended of careful observance, but of attentive contemplation that is prolonged until a clear penetrating understanding of the matter is attained. The opening, disclosure (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, apertio, with Tsere in distinction from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, porta) of God's word giveth light, inasmuch as it makes the simple (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>) wise or sagacious; in connection with which it is assumed that it is God Himself who unfolds the mysteries of His word to those who are anxious to learn. Such an one, anxious to learn, is the poet: he pants with open mouth, viz., for the heavenly fare of such disclosures (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; like &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-11.htm">Psalm 81:11</a>). &#1497;&#1488;&#1489; is a hapaxlegomenon, just as &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489; is also exclusively peculiar to the Psalm before us; both are secondary forms of &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;. Love to God cannot indeed remain unresponded to. The experience of helping grace is a right belonging to those who love the God of revelation; love in return for love, salvation in return for the longing for salvation, is their prerogative. On the ground of this reciprocal relation the petitions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-133.htm">Psalm 119:133-135</a> are then put up, coming back at last to the one chief prayer "teach me." &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-133.htm">Psalm 119:133</a>, is not merely a "promise" in this instance, but the declared will of God in general. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; refers pre-eminently to all sin of disavowal (denying God), into which he might fall under outward and inward pressure (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;). For he has round about him those who do not keep God's law. On account of these apostates (&#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1488; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, equivalent to &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;) his eyes run down rivers of water (&#1497;&#1512;&#1491; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-48.htm">Lamentations 3:48</a>, with an accusative of the object). His mood is not that of unfeeling self-glorying, but of sorrow like that of Jeremiah, because of the contempt of Jahve, and the self-destruction of those who contemn Him. </body></html>
