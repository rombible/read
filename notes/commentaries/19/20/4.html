Neither the crown on the king's head, nor the grace in his heart, would make him free from trouble. Even the greatest of men must be much in prayer. Let none expect benefit by the prayers of the church, or their friends, who are capable of praying for themselves, yet neglect it. Pray that God would protect his person, and preserve his life. That God would enable him to go on in his undertakings for the public good. We may know that God accepts our spiritual sacrifices, if by his Spirit he kindles in our souls a holy fire of piety and love to God. Also, that the Lord would crown his enterprises with success. Our first step to victory in spiritual warfare is to trust only in the mercy and grace of God; all who trust in themselves will soon be cast down. Believers triumph in God, and his revelation of himself to them, by which they distinguish themselves from those that live without God in the world. Those who make God and his name their praise, may make God and his name their trust. This was the case when the pride and power of Jewish unbelief, and pagan idolatry, fell before the sermons and lives of the humble believers in Jesus. This is the case in every conflict with our spiritual enemies, when we engage them in the name, the spirit, and the power of Christ; and this will be the case at the last day, when the world, with the prince of it, shall be brought down and fall; but believers, risen-from the dead, through the resurrection of the Lord, shall stand, and sing his praises in heaven. In Christ's salvation let us rejoice; and set up our banners in the name of the Lord our God, assured that by the saving strength of his right hand we shall be conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grant thee according to thine own heart - According to thy wishes; according to the desires of thy heart.<p>And fulfil all thy counsel - All that thou hast designed or undertaken in the matter; that is, may he enable thee to execute thy purpose. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. thy counsel&#8212;or plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">According to thine own heart, </span> i.e. that good success which thy heart desires. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All thy counsels; </span> thy present design for God, and for his and thy people. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Grant thee according to thine own heart,....

To be desired are the revealed words of God, to him who possesses them as an outward possession; and to him who has received them inwardly they are sweet. The poet, who is himself conscious of being a servant of God, and of striving to act as such, makes use of these words for the end for which they are revealed: he is &#1504;&#1494;&#1492;&#1512;, one who suffers himself to be enlightened, instructed, and warned by them. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; belongs to &#1504;&#1494;&#1492;&#1512; (according to the usual arrangement of the words, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a>), just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a> it belongs to &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;. He knows that &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501; (with a subjective suffix in an objective sense, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-7.htm">Proverbs 25:7</a>, just as we may also say:) in their observance is, or is included, great reward. &#1506;&#1511;&#1489; is that which follows upon one's heels (&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;), or comes immediately after anything, and is used here of the result of conduct. Thus, then, inasmuch as the Law is not only a copy of the divine will, but also a mirror of self-knowledge, in which a man may behold and come to know himself, he prays for forgiveness in respect of the many sins of infirmity, - though for the most part unperceived by him, - to which, even the pardoned one succumbs. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492; (in the terminology of the Law, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;) comprehends the whole province of the peccatum involuntarium, both the peccatum ignoranitiae and the peccatum infirmitatis. The question delicta quis intelligit is equivalent to the negative clause: no one can discern his faults, on account of the heart of man being unfathomable and on account of the disguise, oftentimes so plausible, and the subtlety of sin. Hence, as an inference, follows the prayer: pronounce me free also &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, ab occultis (peccatis, which, however, cannot be supplied on grammatical grounds), equivalent to mee`alumiym (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>), i.e., all those sins, which even he, who is most earnestly striving after sanctification, does not discern, although he may desire to know them, by reason of the ever limited nature of his knowledge both of himself and of sin.<p>(Note: In the Arab proverb, "no sin which is persisted in is small, no sin great for which forgiveness is sought of God," Arab. s&#803;g&#305;&#770;rt, directly means a little and Arab. kb&#305;&#770;rt, a great sin, vid., Allgem. Literar. Zeitschr. 1844, No. 46, p. 363.)<p>&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, is a vox judicialis, to declare innocent, pronounce free from, to let go unpunished. The prayer for justification is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a> by the prayer for sanctification, and indeed for preservation against deliberate sins. From &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;, to seethe, boil over, Hiph. to sin wilfully, deliberately, insolently, - opp. of sin arising from infirmity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>, - is formed &#1494;&#1491; an insolent sinner, one who does not sin &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1504;&#1492;, but &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>, where David's brethren bring this reproach against him), or &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, and the neuter collective &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. &#1505;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-3.htm">Psalm 101:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-2.htm">Hosea 5:2</a>) peccata proaeretica or contra conscientiam, which cast one out of the state of grace or favour, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27-31</a>. For if &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; had been intended of arrogant and insolent possessors of power (Ewald), the prayer would have taken some other form than that of "keeping back" (&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-39.htm">1 Samuel 25:39</a> in the mouth of David). &#1494;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, presumptuous sins, when they are repeated, become dominant sins, which irresistibly enslave the man (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; with a non-personal subject, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-4.htm">Isaiah 3:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>); hence the last member of the climax (which advances from the peccatum involuntarium to the proaereticum, and from this to the regnans): let them not have dominion over me (&#1489;&#1497; with Dech in Baer; generally wrongly marked with Munach).<p>Then (&#1488;&#1494;), when Thou bestowest this twofold favour upon me, the favour of pardon and the grace of preservation, shall I be blameless (&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; 1 fut. Kal, instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, with &#1497; as a characteristic of e&#772;) and absolved (&#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; not Piel, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>, but Niph., to be made pure, absolved) from great transgression. &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; <p>(Note: The Gaja with &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is intended in this instance, where &#1502;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1512;&#1489; are to be read in close connection, to secure distinctness of pronunciation for the unaccented &#1506;, as e.g., is also the case in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>, &#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506; (ba&#772;k&#803;a&#8219;ja&#772;m).)<p>from &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (root &#1508;&#1513;), to spread out, go beyond the bounds, break through, trespass, is a collective name for deliberate and reigning, dominant sin, which breaks through man's relation of favour with God, and consequently casts him out of favour, - in one word, for apostasy. Finally, the psalmist supplicates a gracious acceptance of his prayer, in which both mouth and heart accord, supported by the faithfulness, stable as the rock (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;), and redeeming love (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497; redemptor, vindex, root &#1490;&#1500;, &#1495;&#1500;, to loose, redeem) of his God. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; is a standing expression of the sacrificial tra, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>. The &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, belongs to &#1500;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, stands in the second member in accordance with the "parallelism by postponement." Prayer is a sacrifice offered by the inner man. The heart meditates and fashions it; and the mouth presents it, by uttering that which is put into the form of words. </body></html>
