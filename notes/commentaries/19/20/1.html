Though he had prophets, and priests, and many good people among his subjects to pray for him, yet he did not think that excused him from praying for himself. None must expect benefit by the prayers of the church, or of their ministers or friends for them, who are capable of praying for themselves, and yet neglect it. The prayers of others for us must be desired, not to supersede, but to second our own for ourselves.” <span class="ital">The name of the God of Jacob — </span>That is, God himself, for <span class="ital">names </span>are often put for persons.

Neither the crown on the king's head, nor the grace in his heart, would make him free from trouble. Even the greatest of men must be much in prayer. Let none expect benefit by the prayers of the church, or their friends, who are capable of praying for themselves, yet neglect it. Pray that God would protect his person, and preserve his life. That God would enable him to go on in his undertakings for the public good. We may know that God accepts our spiritual sacrifices, if by his Spirit he kindles in our souls a holy fire of piety and love to God. Also, that the Lord would crown his enterprises with success. Our first step to victory in spiritual warfare is to trust only in the mercy and grace of God; all who trust in themselves will soon be cast down. Believers triumph in God, and his revelation of himself to them, by which they distinguish themselves from those that live without God in the world. Those who make God and his name their praise, may make God and his name their trust. This was the case when the pride and power of Jewish unbelief, and pagan idolatry, fell before the sermons and lives of the humble believers in Jesus. This is the case in every conflict with our spiritual enemies, when we engage them in the name, the spirit, and the power of Christ; and this will be the case at the last day, when the world, with the prince of it, shall be brought down and fall; but believers, risen-from the dead, through the resurrection of the Lord, shall stand, and sing his praises in heaven. In Christ's salvation let us rejoice; and set up our banners in the name of the Lord our God, assured that by the saving strength of his right hand we shall be conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble - According to the view expressed in the introduction to the psalm, this is the language of the people praying for their king, or expressing the hope that he would be delivered from trouble, and would be successful in what he had undertaken, in the prosecution of a war apparently of defense. The word" trouble" here used would seem to imply that he was beset with difficulties and dangers; perhaps, that he was surrounded by foes. It seems that he was going forth to war to deliver his country from trouble, having offered sacrifices and prayers <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> for the purpose of securing the divine favor on the expedition. The point or the moment of the psalm is when those sacrifices had been offered, and when he was about to embark on his enterprise. At that moment the people lift up the voice of sympathy and of encouragement, and pray that those sacrifices might be accepted, and that he might find the deliverance which he had desired.<p>The name of the God of Jacob - The word name is often put in the Scriptures for the person himself; and hence, this is equivalent to saying, "May the God of Jacob defend thee." See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-11.htm">Psalm 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-10.htm">Psalm 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>. Jacob was the one of the patriarchs from whom, after his other name, the Hebrew people derived their name Israel, and the word seems here to be used with reference to the people rather than to the ancestor. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>. The God of Jacob, or the God of Israel, would be synonymous terms, and either would denote that he was the Protector of the nation. As such he is invoked here; and the prayer is, that the Great Protector of the Hebrew people would now defend the king in the dangers which beset him, and in the enterprise which he had undertaken.<p>Defend thee - Margin, as in Hebrew, set thee on a high place. The word means the same as defend him, for the idea is that of being set on a high place, a tower, a mountain, a lofty rock, where his enemies could not reach or assail him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 20<p>Ps 20:1-9. David probably composed this Psalm to express the prayers of the pious for his success as at once the head of the Church and nation. Like other compositions of which David in such relations is the subject, its sentiments have a permanent value&#8212;the prosperity of Christ's kingdom being involved, as well as typified, in that of Israel and its king.<p>1. hear thee&#8212;graciously (Ps 4:1).<p>name of&#8212;or manifested perfections, as power, wisdom, &c.<p>defend thee&#8212;set thee on high from danger (Ps 9:9; 18:3).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/20.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>1 The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble, the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;<p>2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;<p>3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.<p>4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1</a><p>"The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble." All loyal subjects pray for their king, and most certainly citizens of Zion have good cause to pray for the Prince of Peace. In times of conflict loving subjects redouble their pleas, and surely in the sorrows of our Lord his church could not but be in earnest. All the Saviour's days were days of trouble, and he also made them days of prayer; the church joins her intercession with her Lord's, and pleads that he may be heard in his cries and tears. The agony in the garden was especially a gloomy hour, but he was heard in that he feared. He knew that his Father heard him always, yet in that troublous hour no reply came until thrice he had fallen on his face in the garden; then sufficient strength was given in answer to prayer, and he rose a victor from the conflict. On the cross also his prayer was not unheard, for in the twenty-second Psalm he tells us, "thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns." The church in this verse implies that her Lord would be himself much given to prayer; in this he is our example, teaching us that if we are to receive any advantage from the prayers of others, we must first pray for ourselves. What a mercy that we may pray in the day of trouble, and what a still more blessed privilege that no trouble can prevent the Lord from hearing us! Troubles roar like thunder, but the believer's voice will be heard above the storm. O Jesus, when thou pleadest for us in our hour of trouble, the Lord Jehovah will hear thee. This is a most refreshing confidence, and it may be indulged in without fear.<p>"The name of the God of Jacob defend thee;" or, as some read it, "set thee in a high place." By "the name" is meant the revealed character and Word of God; we are not to worship "the unknown God," but we should seek to know the covenant God of Jacob, who has been pleased to reveal his name and attributes to his people. There may be much in a royal name, or a learned name, or a venerale name, but it will be a theme for heavenly scholarship to discover all that is contained in the divine name. The glorious power of God defended and preserved the Lord Jesus through the battle of his life and death, and exalted him above all his enemies. His warfare is now accomplished in his own proper person, but in his mystical body, the church, he is still beset with dangers, and only the eternal arm of our God in covenant can defend the soldiers of the cross, and set them on high out of the reach of their foes. The day of trouble is not over, the pleading Saviour is not silent, and the name of the God of Israel is still the defence of the faithful. The name: "God of Jacob," is suggestive; Jacob had his day of trouble, he wrestled, was heard, was defended, and in due time was set on high, and his God is our God still, the same God to all his wrestling Jacobs. The whole verse is a very fitting benediction to be pronounced by a gracious heart over a child, a friend, or a minister, in prospect of trial; it includes both temporal and spiritual protection, and directs the mind to the great Source of all good. How delightful to believe that our heavenly Father has pronounced it upon our favoured heads!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-2.htm">Psalm 20:2</a><p>"Send thee help from the sanctuary." Out of heaven's sanctuary came the angel to strengthen our Lord, and from the precious remembrance of God's doings in his sanctuary our Lord refreshed himself when on the tree. There is no help like that which is of God's sending, and no deliverance like that which comes out of his sanctuary. The sanctuary to us is the person of our blessed Lord, who was typified by the temple, and is the true sanctuary which God has pitched, and not man: let us fly to the cross for shelter in all times of need, and help will be sent to us. Men of the world despise sanctuary help, but our hearts have learned to prize it beyond all material aid. They seek help out of the armoury, or the treasury, or the buttery, but we turn to the sanctuary. "And strengthen thee out of Zion." Out of the assemblies of the pleading saints who had for ages prayed for their Lord, help might well result to the despised Sufferer, for praying breath is never spent in vain. To the Lord's mystical body the richest good comes in answer to the pleadings of his saints assembled for holy worship as his Zion. Certain advertisers recommend a strengthening plaster, but nothing can give such strength to the loins of a saint as waiting upon God in the assemblies of his people. This verse is a benediction befitting a Sabbath morning, and may be the salutation either of a pastor to his people, or of a church to its minister. God in the sanctuary of his dear Son's person, and in the city of his chosen church is the proper object of his people's prayers, and under such a character may they confidently look to him for his promised aid.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a><p>"Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah." Before war, kings offered sacrifice, upon the acceptance of which they depended for success; our blessed Lord presented himself as a victim, and was a sweet savour unto the Most High, and then he met and routed the embattled legions of hell. Still does his burnt sacrifice perfume the courts of heaven, and through him the offerings of his people are received as his sacrifices and oblations. We ought in our spiritual conflicts to have an eye to the sacrifice of Jesus, and never venture to war until first the Lord has given us a token for good at the altar of the cross, where faith beholds her bleeding Lord. "Selah." It is well to pause at the cross before we march onward to battle, and with the Psalmist cry "Selah." We are too much in a hurry to make good haste. A little pausing might greatly help our speed. Stay, good man, there is a haste which hinders; rest awhile, meditate on the burnt sacrifice, and put thy heart right for the stern work which lieth before thee.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-4.htm">Psalm 20:4</a><p>"Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel." Christ's desire and counsel were both set upon the salvation of his people; the church of old desired for him good speed in his design, and the church in these latter days, with all her heart desires the complete fulfilment of his purpose. In Christ Jesus sanctified souls may appropriate this verse as a promise; they shall have their desire, and their plans to glorify their Master shall succeed. We may have our own will when our will is God's will. This was always the case with our Lord, and yet he said, "not as I will, but as thou wilt." What need for submission in our case; if it was necessary to him, how much more for us! <span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm contains a prayer to be used by the people, both now on the behalf of king David, when he was undertaking some great expedition, going forth, as is supposed, against the Ammonites and Syrians, <span class="bld">2 Samuel 10</span>, or some other potent enemies, and hereafter in like cases. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The church prayeth God to hear and defend the king, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm" title="The LORD hear you in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend you;">Psalm 20:1</a></span>; and for a blessing on all his designs, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/20-2.htm" title="Send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out of Zion;...">Psalm 20:2-6</a></span>; and showeth wherein the confidence of some is; but theirs is in God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/20-7.htm" title="Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God....">Psalm 20:7-9</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">In the day of trouble; </span> in this time of war and danger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Name of the God of Jacob, </span> i.e. God himself; for names are oft put for persons, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-53.htm" title="To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.">Numbers 26:53</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm" title="And in those days Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)">Acts 1:15</a> 4:12</span>; and <span class="ital">the name of God</span> for God, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-58.htm" title="If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;">Deu 28:58</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-5.htm" title="Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.">Nehemiah 9:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-8.htm" title="In God we boast all the day long, and praise your name for ever.

All the days of Christ were days of trouble; he was a brother born for adversity; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with griefs; he had his own sorrows, and he bore the griefs of others; he was persecuted by Herod in his infancy; he was tempted by Satan in the wilderness; he was harassed by the Scribes and Pharisees continually; he was grieved at the hardness, impenitence, and unbelief, of that perverse and faithless generation of men, and was sometimes made uneasy by his own disciples: at some particular seasons his soul or spirit is said to be troubled, as at the grave of Lazarus, and when in a view of his own death, and when he was about to acquaint his disciples that one of them should betray him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>; but more particularly it was a day of trouble with him, when he was in the garden, heavy, and sore amazed, and his sweat was, as it were, drops of blood falling on the ground, and his soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; but more especially this was his case when he hung upon the cross, and is what seems to be principally respected here; when he was in great torture of body through the rack of the cross; when he endured the cruel mockings of men, of the common people, of the chief priests, and even of the thieves that suffered with him; when he had Satan, and all his principalities and powers, let loose upon him, and he was grappling with them; when he bore all the sins of his people, endured the wrath of his Father, and was forsaken by him: now in this day of trouble, both when in the garden and on the cross, he prayed unto his Father, as he had been used to do in other cases, and at other times; and the church here prays, that God would hear and answer him, as he did: he always heard him; he heard him at the grave of Lazarus; he heard him in the garden, and filled his human soul with courage and intrepidity, of which there were immediate instances; he heard him on the cross, and helped him as man and Mediator, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>; <p>the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; that is, God himself, who is named the God of Jacob, whom Jacob called upon, and trusted in as his God, and who answered him in the day of his distress: Jacob was exercised with many troubles, but the Lord delivered him out of them all; and which may be the reason why the Lord is addressed under this character here; besides, Israel is one of the names of the Messiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>; on whose account the petition is put to which may be added, that Jacob may design people of God, the spiritual sons of Jacob, the church of the living God, whose God the Lord is; and the phrase may be here used by the church, to encourage her faith in prayer: the petition, on account of the Messiah, is, that God would "defend" him, or "set" him on "an high place" (n); or "exalt" him: he was brought very low in his state of humiliation; he was in the form of a servant; he was in a very low and mean condition throughout the whole of his life; through the suffering of death he was made lower than the angels, and he was laid in the lower parts of the earth: the church, in this petition, prays for his resurrection from the dead; for his ascension into the highest heavens; for his exaltation at the right hand of God; for the more visible setting him on his throne in his kingdom; in all which she has been answered. <p>(n) "elevet te", Pagninus, Montanus; "exaltet te", Vatablus, Museulus, Michaelis; "in edito collocet te", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Ainsworth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><<To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.>> The <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> name of the God of Jacob defend thee;</span><p>(a) By this kings are also admonished to call to God in their affairs.<p>(b) The virtue, power and grace of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">hear thee</span>] R.V., answer thee, and so in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-6.htm" title="Now know I that the LORD saves his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.">Psalm 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-9.htm" title="Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.">Psalm 20:9</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the day of trouble</span>] Or <span class="ital">distress</span>, when <span class="ital">adversaries</span> (a cognate word) press him hard.

The word of nature declares &#1488;&#1500; (God) to us, the word of Scripture &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (Jahve); the former God's power and glory, the latter also His counsel and will. Now follow twelve encomiums of the Law, of which every two are related as antecedent and consequent, rising and falling according to the caesural schema, after the manner of waves. One can discern how now the heart of the poet begins to beat with redoubled joy as he comes to speak of God's word, the revelation of His will. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; does not in itself mean the law, but a pointing out, instruction, doctrine or teaching, and more particularly such as is divine, and therefore positive; whence it is also used of prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>, and prophetically of the New Testament gospel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>.

The praises which the poet pronounces upon the Law, are accurate even from the standpoint of the New Testament. Even Paul says, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>, "The Law is holy and spiritual, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." The Law merits these praises in itself; and to him who is in a state of favour, it is indeed no longer a law bringing a curse with it, but a mirror of the God merciful in holiness, into which he can look without slavish fear, and is a rule for the direction of his free and willing obedience. And how totally different is the affection of the psalmists and prophets for the Law, - an affection based upon the essence and universal morality of the commandments, and upon a spiritual realisation of the letter, and the consolation of the promises, - from the pharisaical rabbinical service of the letter and the ceremonial in the period after the Exile!<p>The divine Law is called &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, "perfect," i.e., spotless and harmless, as being absolutely well-meaning, and altogether directed towards the well-being of man. And &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; restoring, bringing back, i.e., imparting newness of life, quickening the soul (cf. Pil. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>), to him, viz., who obeys the will of God graciously declared therein, and enters upon the divine way or rule of salvation. Then in the place of the word &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; we find &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, - as the tables of the Ten Commandments (&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;) are called, - from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; (&#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491;), which signifies not merely a corroborative, but also a warning and instructive testimony or attestation.  The testimony of Jahve is &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, made firm, sure, faithful, i.e., raised above all doubt in its declarations, and verifying itself in its threatenings and promises; and hence &#1502;&#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, making wise simplicity, or the simple, lit., openness, the open (root &#1508;&#1514; to spread out, open, Indo-Germ. prat, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;, pat, pad), i.e., easily led astray; to such an one it gives a solid basis and stability, &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>.  The Law divides into &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, precepts or declarations concerning man's obligation; these are &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, straight or upright, as a norma normata, because they proceed from the upright, absolutely good will of God, and as a norma normans they lead along a straight way in the right track. They are therefore &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;, their educative guidance, taking one as it were by the hand, frees one from all tottering, satisfies a moral want, and preserves a joyous consciousness of being in the right way towards the right goal. &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, Jahve's statute (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; statuere), is the tenour of His commandments. The statute is a lamp - it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a> -and the law a light. So here: it is &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, clear, like the light of the sun (Sol 6:10), and its light is imparted to other objects: &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, enlightening the eyes, which refers not merely to the enlightening of the understanding, but of one's whole condition; it makes the mind clear, and body as well as mind healthy and fresh, for the darkness of the eyes is sorrow, melancholy, and bewilderment. In this chain of names for the Law, &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492; is not the fear of God as an act performed, but as a precept, it is what God's revelation demands, effects, and maintains; so that it is the revealed way in which God is to be feared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12</a>) - in short, it is the religion of Jahve (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-33.htm">Proverbs 15:33</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a>). This is &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, clean, pure, as the word which is like to pure gold, by which it is taught, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/12-7.htm">Psalm 12:7</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a>; and therefore &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, enduring for ever in opposition to all false forms of reverencing God, which carry their own condemnation in themselves. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497; &#1492; are the jura of the Law as a corpus juris divini, everything that is right and constitutes right according to the decision of Jahve. These judgments are &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, truth, which endures and verifies itself; because, in distinction from most others and those outside Israel, they have an unchangeable moral foundation: &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;, i.e., they are &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, in accordance with right and appropriate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-8.htm">Deuteronomy 4:8</a>), altogether, because no reproach of inappositeness and sanctioned injustice or wrong clings to them. The eternal will of God has attained a relatively perfect form and development in the Law of Jahve according to the standard set up as the law of the nation. </body></html>
