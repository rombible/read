The root of this vine is Christ, the branches are believers. The church is like a vine, needing support, but spreading and fruitful. If a vine do not bring forth fruit, no tree is so worthless. And are not we planted as in a well-cultivated garden, with every means of being fruitful in works of righteousness? But the useless leaves of profession, and the empty boughs of notions and forms, abound far more than real piety. It was wasted and ruined. There was a good reason for this change in God's way toward them. And it is well or ill with us, according as we are under God's smiles or frowns. When we consider the state of the purest part of the visible church, we cannot wonder that it is visited with sharp corrections. They request that God would help the vine.

These were in Egypt awhile, where they were grievously oppressed and trampled upon; and yet the more they were afflicted, the more they grew and multiplied; and from hence the Lord brought them in due time, with a mighty hand and outstretched arm; <p>he caused them to go out; the word (o) used fitly expresses their journeyings from thence, and through the wilderness; they were a type of the church of Christ, and special people of God, who also are frequently compared to vines and vineyards; see Sol 2:13 the vine tree is fruitful, and bears fruit in clusters but its wood is very useless and unprofitable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a> and it is a tree very weak, and cannot rise and support itself, it must be propped up; so believers in Christ, though fruitful through the grace of God, yet are unprofitable to him, and very weak in themselves, and are upheld by the right hand of his righteousness, on whom they lean and stay themselves; and these, in their natural state, are in worse than Egyptian bondage, darkness, and idolatry, out of which they are brought, in the effectual calling, into Gospel liberty, marvellous light, and the true worship and service of God; and out of the antichristian Egypt will all the Lord's people be brought one day; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>. <p>thou hast cast out the Heathen; the Targum adds, out of the land of Israel, that is, Canaan; it designs the expulsion of the seven nations from thence, to make way for the Israelites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a> and was an emblem of the ejection of Satan out of the Gentile world, and out of the souls of men, through the ministry of the word; and of sin, and the lusts of it, when the King of glory enters in, so as that they shall not any more have dominion; though as the Canaanites were left in the land to be pricks and thorns in the eyes and sides of the Israelites, so indwelling sin remains in God's people to the distress of their souls, and the trial of their graces.

Under the figure of a vine, once carefully tended and spreading far and wide in luxuriant growth, but now exposed to the ravages of wild beasts, the Psalmist contrasts God’s former care for His people with their present plight.

He adopts the figure of a vine, perhaps suggested to him by the description of Joseph in the dying speech of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>), and carries out his metaphor, in nine consecutive verses, with great beauty and consistency. Isaiah's description of Israel as a vineyard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) is somewhat similar. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt</span>. The history of Israel <span class="accented">as a nation</span> begins with the Exodus. The nation was transplanted from Egypt into a soil better fitted for it by the loving hand of God, in order that it might have ample room to grow up and develop itself freely. God "brought it out of Egypt," not merely in the exercise of his ordinary providence over humanity, but by an active exertion of his Almighty power, and a long series of miraculous manifestations, without which the transfer could not have been effected. He then cast out the heathen, and planted it - drove out, that is, before Israel the seven nations of the Hivites, Hittites, Gergashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, and Jebusites, and, having driven them out, "planted" in his own people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/80.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first strophe contains nothing but petition. First of all the nation is called Israel as springing from Jacob; then, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a>, Joseph, which, where it is distinct from Jacob or Judah, is the name of the kingdom of the ten tribes (vid., Caspari on <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>), or at least of the northern tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a> shows that it is also these that are pre-eminently intended here. The fact that in the blessing of Joseph, Jacob calls God a Shepherd (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;), <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, perhaps has somewhat to do with the choice of the first two names. In the third, the sitting enthroned in the sanctuary here below and in the heaven above blend together; for the Old Testament is conscious of a mutual relationship between the earthly and the heavenly temple (&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;) until the one merges entirely in the other. The cher&#1515;bim, which God enthrones, i.e., upon which He sits enthroned, are the bearers of the chariot (&#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492;) of the Ruler of the world (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). With &#1492;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; (from &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;, Arab. yf&#8219;, eminere, emicare, as in the Asaph <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>) the poet prays that He would appear in His splendour of light, i.e., in His fiery bright, judging, and rescuing doxa, whether as directly visible, or even as only recognisable by its operation. Both the comparison, "after the manner of a flock" and the verb &#1504;&#1492;&#1490; are Asaphic, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1-12</a>. Just so also the names given to the nation. The designation of Israel after the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh attaches itself to the name Joseph; and the two take the brother after the flesh into their midst, of whom the beloved Rachel was the mother as well as of Joseph, the father of Ephraim and Manasseh. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a> also, these three are not separated, but have their camp on the west side of the Tabernacle. May God again put into activity - which is the meaning of &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; (excitare) in distinction from &#1495;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (expergefacere) - His &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, the need for the energetic intervention of which now makes itself felt, before these three tribes, i.e., by becoming their victorious leader. &#1500;&#1499;&#1492; is a summoning imperative.<p>(Note: Not a pronoun: to Thee it belongs to be for salvation for us, as the Talmud, Midrash, and Masora (vid., Norzi) take it; wherefore in J.

It is not a bringing back out of the Exile that is prayed for by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, for, according to the whole impression conveyed by the Psalm, the people are still on the soil of their fatherland; but in their present feebleness they are no longer like themselves, they stand in need of divine intervention in order again to attain a condition that is in harmony with the promises, in order to become themselves again. May God then cause His long hidden countenance to brighten and shine upon them, then shall they be helped as they desire (&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;). </body></html>
