The root of this vine is Christ, the branches are believers. The church is like a vine, needing support, but spreading and fruitful. If a vine do not bring forth fruit, no tree is so worthless. And are not we planted as in a well-cultivated garden, with every means of being fruitful in works of righteousness? But the useless leaves of profession, and the empty boughs of notions and forms, abound far more than real piety. It was wasted and ruined. There was a good reason for this change in God's way toward them. And it is well or ill with us, according as we are under God's smiles or frowns. When we consider the state of the purest part of the visible church, we cannot wonder that it is visited with sharp corrections. They request that God would help the vine. Lord, it is formed by thyself, and for thyself, therefore it may, with humble confidence, be committed to thyself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/80.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The boar out of the wood - Men come in and ravage the land, whose character may be compared with the wild boar. The word rendered boar means simply swine. The addition of the phrase "out of the wood" determines its meaning here, and shows that the reference is to wild or untamed swine; swine that roam the woods - an animal always extremely fierce and savage.<p>Doth waste it - The word used here occurs nowhere else. It means to cut down or cut off; to devour; to lay waste.<p>And the wild beast of the field - Of the unenclosed field; or, that roams at large - such as lions, panthers, tigers, wolves. The word here used - &#1494;&#1497;&#1494;  z&#305;&#770;yz - occurs besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-11.htm">Psalm 50:11</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-11.htm">Isaiah 66:11</a>.

As Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, who carried the ten tribes captive; the title of this psalm in the Septuagint version is, a psalm for the Assyrian. Vitringa, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a> interprets this of Antiochus Epiphanes, to whose times he thinks the psalm refers; but the Jews (r) of the fourth beast in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, which designs the Roman empire: the wild boar is alluded to, which lives in woods and forests (s), and wastes, fields, and vineyards: <p>and the wild beast of the field doth devour it; as Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who carried the two tribes captive, and who for a while lived among and lived as the beasts of the field; both these, in their turns, wasted and devoured the people of Israel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-17.htm">Jeremiah 50:17</a>. Jarchi interprets this of Esau or Edom, that is, Rome; and says the whole of the paragraph respects the Roman captivity; that is, their present one; but rather the words describe the persecutors of the Christian church in general, comparable to wild boars and wild beasts for their fierceness and cruelty; and perhaps, in particular, Rome Pagan may be pointed at by the one, and Rome Papal by the other; though the latter is signified by two beasts, one that rose out of the sea, and the other out of the earth; which have made dreadful havoc of the church of Christ, his vine, and have shed the blood of the saints in great abundance; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>, unless we should rather by the one understand the pope, and by the other the Turk, as the Jews interpret them of Esau and of Ishmael. <p>(r) Gloss. in T.

The "boar out of the wood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wild boar - is probably Tiglath-pileser (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>), or the Assyrian power generally. <span class="cmt_word">And the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</span> Other beasts, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> other enemies of Israel, join in and share in the plundering (see above, ver. 6, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/80.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the second strophe there issues forth bitter complaint concerning the form of wrath which the present assumes, and, thus confirmed, the petition rises anew. The transferring of the smoking (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;) of God's nostrils  equals  the hard breathing of anger (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-19.htm">Deuteronomy 29:19</a>), to God Himself is bold, but in keeping with the spirit of the Biblical view of the wrath of God (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>), so that there is no need to avoid the expression by calling in the aid of the Syriac word &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, to be strong, powerful (why art Thou hard, why dost Thou harden Thyself...). The perfect after &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; has the sense of a present with a retrospective glance, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, to be understood after the analogy of &#1495;&#1512;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; (to kindle  equals  to be angry against any one), for the prayer of the people is not an object of wrath, but only not a means of turning it aside. While the prayer is being presented, God veils Himself in the smoke of wrath, through which it is not able to penetrate. The lxx translators have read &#1489;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;, for they render &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (for which the common reading is &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;). Bread of tears is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>, bread consisting of tears; tears, running down in streams upon the lips of the praying and fasting one, are his meat and his drink. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; with an accusative signifies to give something to drink, and followed by Beth, to give to drink by means of something, but it is not to be translated: potitandum das eis cum lacrymis trientem (De Dieu, von Ortenberg, and Hitzig). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (Talmudic, a third part) is the accusative of more precise definition (Vatablus, Gesenius, Olshausen, and Hupfeld): by thirds (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;, Symmachus &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;); for a third of an ephah is certainly a very small measure for the dust of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>), but a large one for tears. The neighbours are the neighbouring nations, to whom Israel is become &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, an object, a butt of contention. In &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; is expressed the pleasure which the mocking gives them. </body></html>
