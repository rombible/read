But we can neither expect the comfort of his love, nor the protection of his arm, unless we partake of his converting grace. If he is really angry at the prayers of his people, it is because, although they pray, their ends are not right, or there is some secret sin indulged in them, or he will try their patience and perseverance in prayer. When God is displeased with his people, we must expect to see them in tears, and their enemies in triumph. There is no salvation but from God's favour; there is no conversion to God but by his own grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/80.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Turn us again - This phrase in our translation would seem to mean, "Turn us again from our sins," or, "Bring us back to our duty, and to thy love;" and this idea is commonly attached to the phrase probably by the readers of the Bible. But this, though in itself an appropriate prayer, is not the idea here. It is simply, Bring us back; cause us to return; restore us. The idea thus suggested would be either<p>(a) restore us to our former state of prosperity; that is, Cause these desolations to cease; or<p>(b) bring us back, as from captivity, to our own land; restore us to our country and our homes, from which we have been driven out.<p>Thus understood, it would be properly the language of those who were in captivity or exile, praying that they might be restored again to their own land.<p>And cause thy face to shine - Be favorable or propitious to us. Let the frown on thy countenance disappear. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>.<p>And we shall be saved - Saved from our dangers; saved from our troubles. It is also true that when God causes his face to shine upon us, we shall be saved from our sins; saved from ruin. It is only by his smile and favor that we can be saved in any sense, or from any danger. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/80.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.
