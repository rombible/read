But we can neither expect the comfort of his love, nor the protection of his arm, unless we partake of his converting grace. If he is really angry at the prayers of his people, it is because, although they pray, their ends are not right, or there is some secret sin indulged in them, or he will try their patience and perseverance in prayer. When God is displeased with his people, we must expect to see them in tears, and their enemies in triumph. There is no salvation but from God's favour; there is no conversion to God but by his own grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/80.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Turn us again, O God of hosts ... - This verse is the same as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a>, except that here the appeal is to the "God of hosts;" there, it is simply to "God." This indicates greater earnestness; a deeper sense of the need of the interposition of God, indicated by the reference to his attribute as the leader of hosts or armies, and therefore able to save them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/80.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. strife&#8212;object or cause of (Isa 9:11).

First of all the nation is called Israel as springing from Jacob; then, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/81-6.htm">Psalm 81:6</a>, Joseph, which, where it is distinct from Jacob or Judah, is the name of the kingdom of the ten tribes (vid., Caspari on <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>), or at least of the northern tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>.). <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a> shows that it is also these that are pre-eminently intended here. The fact that in the blessing of Joseph, Jacob calls God a Shepherd (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;), <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, perhaps has somewhat to do with the choice of the first two names. In the third, the sitting enthroned in the sanctuary here below and in the heaven above blend together; for the Old Testament is conscious of a mutual relationship between the earthly and the heavenly temple (&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;) until the one merges entirely in the other. The cher&#1515;bim, which God enthrones, i.e., upon which He sits enthroned, are the bearers of the chariot (&#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492;) of the Ruler of the world (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). With &#1492;&#1493;&#1508;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; (from &#1497;&#1508;&#1506;, Arab. yf&#8219;, eminere, emicare, as in the Asaph <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>) the poet prays that He would appear in His splendour of light, i.e., in His fiery bright, judging, and rescuing doxa, whether as directly visible, or even as only recognisable by its operation. Both the comparison, "after the manner of a flock" and the verb &#1504;&#1492;&#1490; are Asaphic, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1-12</a>. Just so also the names given to the nation. The designation of Israel after the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh attaches itself to the name Joseph; and the two take the brother after the flesh into their midst, of whom the beloved Rachel was the mother as well as of Joseph, the father of Ephraim and Manasseh. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a> also, these three are not separated, but have their camp on the west side of the Tabernacle. May God again put into activity - which is the meaning of &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; (excitare) in distinction from &#1495;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (expergefacere) - His &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, the need for the energetic intervention of which now makes itself felt, before these three tribes, i.e., by becoming their victorious leader. &#1500;&#1499;&#1492; is a summoning imperative.<p>(Note: Not a pronoun: to Thee it belongs to be for salvation for us, as the Talmud, Midrash, and Masora (vid., Norzi) take it; wherefore in J. Succa 54c it is straightway written &#1500;&#1498;. Such a &#1500;&#1499;&#1492;  equals  &#1500;&#1498; is called in the language of the Masora, and even in the Midrash (Exod. Rabba, fol. 121), &#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1493;&#1491;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514; (vid., Buxtorf, Tiberias, p. 245).)<p>Concerning &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1492; vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>; the construction with Lamed says as little against the accusative adverbial rendering of the ah set forth there as does the Beth of &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (in the wood) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-15.htm">1 Samuel 23:15</a>, vid., Bttcher's Neue Aehrenlese, Nos. 221, 384, 449. It is not a bringing back out of the Exile that is prayed for by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, for, according to the whole impression conveyed by the Psalm, the people are still on the soil of their fatherland; but in their present feebleness they are no longer like themselves, they stand in need of divine intervention in order again to attain a condition that is in harmony with the promises, in order to become themselves again. May God then cause His long hidden countenance to brighten and shine upon them, then shall they be helped as they desire (&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492;). </body></html>
