The root of this vine is Christ, the branches are believers. The church is like a vine, needing support, but spreading and fruitful. If a vine do not bring forth fruit, no tree is so worthless. And are not we planted as in a well-cultivated garden, with every means of being fruitful in works of righteousness? But the useless leaves of profession, and the empty boughs of notions and forms, abound far more than real piety. It was wasted and ruined. There was a good reason for this change in God's way toward them. And it is well or ill with us, according as we are under God's smiles or frowns. When we consider the state of the purest part of the visible church, we cannot wonder that it is visited with sharp corrections. They request that God would help the vine. Lord, it is formed by thyself, and for thyself, therefore it may, with humble confidence, be committed to thyself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/80.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She sent out her boughs unto the sea - To the Mediterranean Sea on the one side.<p>And her branches - Her sucklings.

The transferring of the smoking (&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;) of God's nostrils  equals  the hard breathing of anger (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-19.htm">Deuteronomy 29:19</a>), to God Himself is bold, but in keeping with the spirit of the Biblical view of the wrath of God (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>), so that there is no need to avoid the expression by calling in the aid of the Syriac word &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, to be strong, powerful (why art Thou hard, why dost Thou harden Thyself...). The perfect after &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; has the sense of a present with a retrospective glance, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>, cf. &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, to be understood after the analogy of &#1495;&#1512;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468; (to kindle  equals  to be angry against any one), for the prayer of the people is not an object of wrath, but only not a means of turning it aside. While the prayer is being presented, God veils Himself in the smoke of wrath, through which it is not able to penetrate. The lxx translators have read &#1489;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1514; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;, for they render &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (for which the common reading is &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;). Bread of tears is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>, bread consisting of tears; tears, running down in streams upon the lips of the praying and fasting one, are his meat and his drink. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; with an accusative signifies to give something to drink, and followed by Beth, to give to drink by means of something, but it is not to be translated: potitandum das eis cum lacrymis trientem (De Dieu, von Ortenberg, and Hitzig). &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (Talmudic, a third part) is the accusative of more precise definition (Vatablus, Gesenius, Olshausen, and Hupfeld): by thirds (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;, Symmachus &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;); for a third of an ephah is certainly a very small measure for the dust of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>), but a large one for tears. The neighbours are the neighbouring nations, to whom Israel is become &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, an object, a butt of contention.
