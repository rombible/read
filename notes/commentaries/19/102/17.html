When we consider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifold defects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not be received in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law. Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; and that great work is described by the temporal deliverance and restoration of Israel. Look down upon us, Lord Jesus; and bring us into the glorious liberty of thy children, that we may bless and praise thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/102.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He will regard the prayer - literally, "He looks upon," or "he 'turns himself' to their prayer." He does not any longer seem to turn away from them and disregard them. He shows by thus building up Zion that he does regard prayer; that he hears the supplications of his people. There is no higher proof that prayer is heard than that which is often furnished in a revival of pure religion. All such revivals, like that on the day of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a> ff), are usually preceded, as that was <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13-14</a>, by special prayer; in those revivals there are often most manifest and clear answers to prayer for the conversion of individuals; to prayer for a blessing on a preached gospel; to prayer for particular relatives and friends.<p>Of the destitute - literally, "of the poor." The word - &#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512;  &#8219;ar&#8219;a&#770;r - occurs only here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>, where it is rendered "heath:" "He shall be like the 'heath' in the desert." The word, according to its etymology, means "naked;" then, poor, stripped of everything, impoverished, wholly destitute. It would thus be eminently applicable to the poor exiles in Babylon; it is as applicable to sinners pleading with God, and to the people of God themselves, destitute of everything like self-righteousness, and feeling that they have nothing in themselves, but that they are wholly dependent on the mercy of God. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>.<p>And not despise their prayer - Not treat it with contempt; not pass it by unheard. This is stated as one of the reasons why the nations would be struck with awe - that God, the infinite God, would hear the prayers of those who were so poor, so powerless, so friendless. There is, in fact, nothing more suited to excite wonder than that God does hear the prayer of poor, lost, sinful man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/102.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Of the destitute of human help and support, protection and defence; as the church in the wilderness; of the "poor", as the Syriac and Arabic versions, both in spirit and in purse; of the "humble", as the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin: the word (c) signifies a low shrub or plant; it is rendered, the heath in the wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a> and designs the saints in their low and afflicted state, during the reign of antichrist, and while the witnesses prophesy in sackcloth; these are the elect that pray day and night, and give the Lord no rest till he establish and make Jerusalem a praise in the earth; and the prayers of these are regarded and looked to by the Lord; his eyes are upon and his ears are open to these praying ones; and all the glorious things which shall be done for the church of God will be in consequence of their prayers: <p>and not despise their prayer; not reject it with contempt and abhorrence; more is intended than is expressed: the meaning is, that he will receive it with pleasure, and return an answer to it; the prayer of these poor destitute ones is delightful to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8</a>. <p>(c) "eorum, qui sunt veluti myricae", Pagninus, Vatablus, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/102.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he hath regarded</span>...  <span class="accented">and hath not despised</span> (see the Revised Version). The word translated "destitute" is elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>) only used as the name of a shrub - probably the dwarf juniper, still so called by the Arabs. The dwarf juniper has "a gloomy stunted appearance" (Tristram), and well symbolizes the Israel of the Captivity period, dry and withered, like a wretched desert shrub. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/102.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ashes are his bread (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16</a>), inasmuch as he, a mourner, sits in ashes, and has thrown ashes all over himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-30.htm">Ezekiel 27:30</a>.

"That Thou hast lifted me up and cast me down" is to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a>. First of all God has taken away the firm ground from under his feet, then from aloft He has cast him to the ground - an emblem of the lot of Israel, which is removed from its fatherland and cast into exile, i.e., into a strange land. In that passage the days of his life are &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500; &#1504;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, like a lengthened shadow, which grows longer and longer until it is entirely lost in darkness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-23.htm">Psalm 109:23</a>.
