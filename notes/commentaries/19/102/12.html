For the word “remembrance,” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm" title="Sing to the LORD, O you saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.">Psalm 30:4</a>. It is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm" title="And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.">Exodus 3:15</a>, “This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial through all generations.” The generations come and go, and the memory of man perishes, but the name “Jehovah” endures still, the object of adoration and praise.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/102.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>102:12-22 We are dying creatures, but God is an everlasting God, the protector of his church; we may be confident that it will not be neglected. When we consider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifold defects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not be received in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law. Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; and that great work is described by the temporal deliverance and restoration of Israel. Look down upon us, Lord Jesus; and bring us into the glorious liberty of thy children, that we may bless and praise thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/102.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever - Though my condition has been changed, though I have been cast down from an exalted position, though kingdoms rise and fall, yet thou art unchanged. Thy purposes will abide. Thy promises will be fulfilled. Thy character is the same. As thou hast been the hearer of prayer in past times, so thou art now. As thou hast interposed in behalf of thy people in other ages, so thou wilt now. As thy people in affliction have been permitted to come to thee, so they may come to thee now. The psalmist here brings to his own mind, as an encouragement in trouble, as we may at all times, the fact that God is an unchanging God; that he always lives; that he is ever the same. We could have no ground of hope if God changed; if he formed purposes only to abandon them; if he made promises only to disregard them; if today he were a Being of mercy and goodness, and tomorrow would be merely a Being of justice and wrath. This argument is enlarged upon in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-28</a>.<p>And thy remembrance unto all generations - Thy memory; or, the remembrance of thee. My days are like a shadow. I shall pass away, and be forgotten. No one will recollect me; no one will feel any interest in remembering that I have ever lived (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">Psalm 31:12</a>). But while one knows that this must be so in regard to himself and to all other people - that he and they are alike to be forgotten - he may also feel that there is One who will never be forgotten. God will never pass away. He will be always the same. All the hopes of the church - of the world - are based on this. It is not on man - on any one individual - on any number of people - for they will all alike pass away and be forgotten; but one generation of people after another, to the end of time, may call on God, and find him an ever-living, an unchanged and unchangeable protector and friend. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/102.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Thus this clause exactly answers to the former; and both of them describe the eternity of God’s existence, whereby the psalmist relieves and supports himself under the consideration of his own and his people’s frailty and vanity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/102.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever,.... This address is made to Christ, as is clear from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>, compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>, who is a divine Person, endures for ever, is from everlasting to everlasting, unchangeably the same in his love, power, wisdom, faithfulness, &amp;c. and though he died as man, he will die no more; he is alive, and lives for evermore; and because he lives, his people shall live also; and he will come again to take them to himself: and, as Mediator, he is King for ever; always continues, as such, to rule over, protect, and defend his people; and is a Priest for ever, and ever lives to make intercession for them; and his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, have a constant virtue in them, to take away sin, and secure from it: the consideration of the perpetuity of Christ, in his person and offices, was a comfort to the psalmist under his troubles, and in a view of his own declining state: the Targum is, <p>"but thou, O Lord, thy habitation continues for ever in heaven:'' <p>and thy remembrance to all generations; the remembrance of his name Jehovah, or Jesus, or Immanuel, or any other, is sweet and precious to his saints in all ages; and so the remembrance of his works, of what he has done and suffered, especially the great work of redemption; for the remembrance of which the ordinance of the Lord's supper is appointed to be continued till his second coming; and his Gospel is an everlasting one, which will transmit the memory of him to men in every age, to the end of the world; and though all flesh is as grass, and every man dies, even the ministers of the word, yet that itself lives for ever. Aben Ezra reads "thy throne", as agreeing with <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-19.htm">Lamentations 5:19</a>, but Kimchi observes that this reading is owing to a bad copy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/102.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But thou, O LORD, shalt <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</span><p>(i) Though we are frail, yet your promise is sure, and the remembrance of it will confirm us forever.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/102.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. But thou, Jehovah, shalt sit enthroned for ever;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And thy memorial shall be for generation after generation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verse is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-19.htm" title="You, O LORD, remain for ever; your throne from generation to generation.">Lamentations 5:19</a>, with the substitution of <span class="ital">memorial</span> for <span class="ital">throne</span>. The thought in which the Psalmist takes refuge is not merely Jehovah’s eternity (‘shalt abide’), but Jehovah’s eternal sovereignty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm" title="But the LORD shall endure for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment.">Psalm 9:7</a>). The name which is His memorial to one generation after another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm" title="And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.">Exodus 3:15</a>) is the pledge and expression of that sovereign rule. “I will be that I will be,” ever revealing Myself as the Living God, working out My plan in the history of the world. Such as He revealed Himself to be in the Exodus, He must continue to be for all time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">12–22</span>. From the thought of his own frailty and transitoriness he turns to the eternal sovereignty of Jehovah, which is the sure pledge for Zion’s restoration.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The second part of the psalm here begins. Against the complaint is to be set the confident hope and consolation. <span class="cmt_word">But thou, O Lord, shalt endure forever.</span> God does not "wither" or decay - God and God's purposes "endure forever." It matters not that Israel is brought so low, and seems at the last gasp; God can raise up his people, and will do so in his own good time (vers. 13-17). <span class="cmt_word">And thy remembrance unto all generations;</span> or, <span class="accented">thy memorial</span> (Revised Version); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>. God's "remembrance," or "memorial," consists in the recollection, that his faithful ones have, of his historically manifested attributes. If this recollection is never to pass away, his faithful ones must remain also, to keep it up. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/102.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1511;&#1488;&#1514; (construct of &#1511;&#1488;&#1514; or &#1511;&#1488;&#1514; from &#1511;&#1488;&#1492;, vid., Isaiah, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11-12</a>), according to the lxx, is the pelican, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505; is the night-raven or the little horned-owl.<p>(Note: The lxx renders it: I am like a pelican of the desert, I am become as a night-raven upon a ruined place (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#837;).

The Graeco-Veneta also renders &#1511;&#1488;&#1514; with &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;, - the Peshito, however, with Syr. qa&#772;qa&#772;'.

They are both unclean creatures, which are fond of the loneliness of the desert and ruined places. To such a wilderness, that of the exile, is the poet unwillingly transported. He passes the nights without sleep (&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491;, to watch during the time for sleep), and is therefore like a bird sitting lonesome (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;, Syriac erroneously &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1491;) upon the roof whilst all in the house beneath are sleeping. The Athnach in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-8.htm">Psalm 102:8</a> separates that which is come to be from the ground of the "becoming" and the "becoming" itself.
