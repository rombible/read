When we consider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifold defects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not be received in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law. Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; and that great work is described by the temporal deliverance and restoration of Israel. Look down upon us, Lord Jesus; and bring us into the glorious liberty of thy children, that we may bless and praise thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/102.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To declare the name of the Lord in Zion ... - That his name might be declared in Zion, or that his praise might be set up in Jerusalem again.

This prophetic prospect (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1-5</a>) that the restoration of Jerusalem will take place simultaneously with the glorious parusia of Jahve re-echoes here in a lyric form. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-17.htm">Psalm 102:17</a>, states the ground of the reverence, just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-20.htm">Psalm 102:20</a> the ground of the praise. The people of the Exile are called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a> &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, to be naked: homeless, powerless, honourless, and in the eyes of men, prospectless. The lxx renders this word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a> &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, and its plural, formed by an internal change of vowel, &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-6.htm">Jeremiah 48:6</a> &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which are only particularizations of the primary notion of that which is stark naked, neglected, wild. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a> is an echo off <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a>. In the mirror of this and of other Psalms written in times of affliction the Israel of the Exile saw itself reflected. </body></html>
