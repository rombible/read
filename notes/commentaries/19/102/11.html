And just so, the psalmist intimates, the hopes which they had sometimes entertained of a restitution were quickly cut off and disappointed. <span class="ital">But thou shalt endure for ever </span>— But this is my comfort, although we die, and our hopes vanish, yet our God is unchangeable and everlasting, and therefore not to be conquered by his and our enemies, however numerous and powerful, but is constant in his counsels and purposes of mercy to his church, steadfast and faithful in the performance of all his promises; and therefore he both can and will deliver his people. <span class="ital">And thy remembrance unto all generations — </span>To the end of time, nay, to eternity: thou shalt be known and honoured; and “the remembrance of thy former works and mercies comforts our hearts, and encourages us to hope, nay, even to rejoice, in the midst of our sorrow and tribulation.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/102.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>102:1-11 The whole word of God is of use to direct us in prayer; but here, is often elsewhere, the Holy Ghost has put words into our mouths. Here is a prayer put into the hands of the afflicted; let them present it to God. Even good men may be almost overwhelmed with afflictions. It is our duty and interest to pray; and it is comfort to an afflicted spirit to unburden itself, by a humble representation of its griefs. We must say, Blessed be the name of the Lord, who both gives and takes away. The psalmist looked upon himself as a dying man; My days are like a shadow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/102.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Man is like to vanity;<p>His days are as a shadowy that passeth away.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>My days are like a shadow that declineth - The shadow made by the gnomon on a sun-dial, which marks the hours as they pass. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-10.htm">2 Kings 20:10</a>. The idea is that the shadow made by the descending sun was about to disappear altogether. It had become less distinct and clear, and it would soon vanish. It would seem from this, that the dial was so made that the shadow indicating the hour ascended when the sun ascended, and declined when the sun went down.

Or, "that is stretched out" (s), which, though it may appear long, is soon at an end; as it does appear longer when the sun sets (t), and departs from the earth: he reckons his life not by months and years, but by days; and these he compares to a "shadow", which has no substance in it; his age being as nothing before the Lord, and has much darkness and obscurity in it; his days being days of darkness, affliction, and trouble, and quickly gone, as man's life is; there is no abiding; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>. Pindar (u) calls man the dream of a shadow: <p>and I am withered like grass; which in the morning is flourishing, is cut down at noon, and withered at evening: this is the case of all flesh, however beautiful and goodly it may look; it is weak, frail, and mortal; cannot stand before the force of afflictions, which quickly consume strength and beauty, and much less before the scythe of death; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>. <p>(s) "inclinata", Pagninus, Montanus, Piscator, Musculus, Cocceius; "extensa", Michaelis.

The psalmist, like his nation, is old before his time; the shades of evening have come upon him, when he should have been in his midday brightness. And I am withered like grass (comp. ver. 4). The "I" here is emphatic (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>) - not only is the psalmist's heart withered, but he himself is altogether scorched and dried up. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/102.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From this point onward the Psalm becomes original.

The reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1511;&#1491; (in the Karaite Ben-Jerucham) enriches the lexicon in the same sense with a word which has scarcely had any existence. &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1491; (Arabic mauk&#803;id) signifies here, as in other instances, a hearth. &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>, Niphal: my bones are heated through with a fever-heat, as a hearth with the smouldering fire that is on it. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>) is used exactly as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>. The heart is said to dry up when the life's blood, of which it is the reservoir, fails. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1495; is followed by &#1502;&#1503; of dislike. On the cleaving of the bones to the flesh from being baked, i.e., to the skin (Arabic bas&#780;ar, in accordance with the radical signification, the surface of the body  equals  the skin, from &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, to brush along, rub, scrape, scratch on the surface), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>. &#1500; (&#1488;&#1500;) with &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511; is used just like &#1489;&#1468;.

Continuous straining of the voice, especially in connection with persevering prayer arising from inward conflict, does really make the body waste away. </body></html>
