When we consider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifold defects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not be received in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law. Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; and that great work is described by the temporal deliverance and restoration of Israel. Look down upon us, Lord Jesus; and bring us into the glorious liberty of thy children, that we may bless and praise thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/102.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt arise - Thou wilt come forth - as if God had been inattentive or inactive.<p>And have mercy upon Zion - That is, Upon Jerusalem - represented as in a state of desolation.

It refers to some purpose or appointment in regard to anything that is to be done, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-5.htm">2 Samuel 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-21.htm">Genesis 17:21</a>; or to a fixed period, as when certain things are to be done, certain festivals to be held regularly at a certain season of the year, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-5.htm">Hosea 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-9.htm">Hosea 12:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-2.htm">Leviticus 23:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-37.htm">Leviticus 23:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-44.htm">Leviticus 23:44</a>. Here it means that there was some period fixed in the Divine Mind when this was to occur, or a definite time when it had been predicted or promised that it would occur. The language is such as would be applicable to the captivity in Babylon, concerning which there was a promise that it should continue but seventy years. If the psalm refers to that, then the meaning is that there were indications in the course of events that that period was about to arrive. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>. What those indications were in this case, the psalmist immediately states, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-14.htm">Psalm 102:14</a>. It may be remarked here, that there are usually some previous intimations or indications of what God is about to do. "Coming events cast their shadows before." Even the divine purposes are accomplished usually in connection with human agency, and in the regular course of events; and it is frequently possible to anticipate that God is about to appear for the fulfillment of his promises. So it was in the coming of the Saviour. So it was in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. So it is when God is about to revive religion in a church. So it is, and will be, in regard to the conversion of the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/102.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14.
