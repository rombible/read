We must own God's hand in it; and must reconcile this to his love, for often those that have used their strength well, have it weakened; and those who, as we think, can very ill be spared, have their days shortened. It is very comfortable, in reference to all the changes and dangers of the church, to remember that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. And in reference to the death of our bodies, and the removal of friends, to remember that God is an everlasting God. Do not let us overlook the assurance this psalm contains of a happy end to all the believer's trials. Though all things are changing, dying, perishing, like a vesture folding up and hastening to decay, yet Jesus lives, and thus all is secure, for he hath said, Because I live ye shall live also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/102.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of old - See this passage fully explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10-12</a>. In the beginning; at the first. The phrase used here means literally "to the face;" then, "before" in the order of time. It means here, long ago; of olden time; at the beginning. The meaning is, that the years of God had stretched through all the generations of people, and all the changes which had occurred upon the earth; that at the very beginning he existed, and that he would continue to exist to the very close, unchangeably the same. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/102.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-28. The writer, speaking for the Church, finds encouragement in the midst of all his distresses. God's eternal existence is a pledge of faithfulness to His promises.<p>in the way&#8212;of providence.<p>weakened&#8212;literally, "afflicted," and made fearful of a premature end, a figure of the apprehensions of the Church, lest God might not perform His promise, drawn from those of a person in view of the dangers of early death (compare Ps 89:47). Paul (Heb 1:10) quotes Ps 102:26-28 as addressed to Christ in His divine nature. The scope of the Psalm, as already seen, so far from opposing, favors this view, especially by the sentiments of Ps 102:12-15 (compare Isa 60:1). The association of the Messiah with a day of future glory to the Church was very intimate in the minds of Old Testament writers; and with correct views of His nature it is very consistent that He should be addressed as the Lord and Head of His Church, who would bring about that glorious future on which they ever dwelt with fond delightful anticipations.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/102.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The eternity of God looks both backward and forward, it is both without beginning and without end.

The lower part of the creation, the Lord's footstool, called the earth beneath: this has its foundation; though what it is cannot be well said, it cannot be searched out; it is sometimes said to be founded upon the waters, and yet so as not to be removed for ever, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-37.htm">Jeremiah 31:37</a>, this shows the wisdom of God, as a wise master builder, and the stability of the earth; and is a proof of the deity of Christ, to whom these words belong: this is said to be done "of old", or "at" or "in the beginning", as Jarchi and the Targum; and so in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>, where they are applied to the Messiah, the Son of God; and this, as it proves the eternity of Christ, who must be in the beginning, and before all things, so it confutes the notion of the eternity of the earth, received by some philosophers: besides, the words may be rendered, "before" (g) "thou foundest the earth"; and so refers to the preceding, "thy years", &amp;c. were before the earth was; that is, from eternity, and so fully express the eternal existence of Christ: <p>and the heavens are the work of thy hands; these are the airy and starry heavens, and the heaven of heavens; which are creatures, and not to be worshipped, made by Christ himself, and are expressive of his power, wisdom, and glory. <p>(g) "antea", Pagninus, Montanus, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/102.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the heavens are the work of thy hands</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-11.htm">Psalm 89:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/102.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet goes on advancing motives to Jahve for the fulfilment of his desire, by holding up to Him what will take place when He shall have restored Zion. The evangel of God's redemptive deed will be written down for succeeding generations, and a new, created people, i.e., a people coming into existence, the church of the future, shall praise God the Redeemer for it. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-14.htm">Psalm 48:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>. &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488; like &#1506;&#1501; &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1491; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>, perhaps with reference to deutero-Isaianic passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>. On <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-20.htm">Psalm 102:20</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-21.htm">Psalm 102:21</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>) the deutero-Isaianic colouring is very evident. And <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-21.htm">Psalm 102:21</a> rests still more verbally upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-11.htm">Psalm 79:11</a>. The people of the Exile are as it were in prison and chains (&#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;), and are advancing towards their destruction (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;), if God does not interpose. Those who have returned home are the subject to &#1500;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;. &#1489;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-23.htm">Psalm 102:23</a> introduces that which takes place simultaneously: with the release of Israel from servitude is united the conversion of the world. &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509; occurs in the same connection as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4</a>. After having thus revelled in the glory of the time of redemption the poet comes back to himself and gives form to his prayer on his own behalf. </body></html>
