When we consider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifold defects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not be received in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law. Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; and that great work is described by the temporal deliverance and restoration of Israel. Look down upon us, Lord Jesus; and bring us into the glorious liberty of thy children, that we may bless and praise thy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/102.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the people are gathered together - When they shall be brought from their dispersion in distant lands; when they shall assemble again in the city of their fathers, and when public worship shall be celebrated there as in former ages.<p>And the kingdoms, to serve the Lord - The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate render this, "kings." The reference must be to the time when those of other lands - kings and their people - would be converted to the true religion; when the Gentiles as well as the Jews, then one undistinguished people, would be brought to the knowledge of the true God, and would unite in his worship. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>. All of all lands, will yet praise the Lord "as if" they were one great congregation, assembled in one place. Thus, though separate, they will with united feeling recount the mercy and goodness of God to his people in past times. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/102.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Israel does not return alone: its restoration will be the signal for that gathering of the nations to worship Jehovah in Zion, which ancient prophecy had foretold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a> ff. = <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1</a> ff.), and which recent prophecy had uncompromisingly reaffirmed in the teeth of appearances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a> ff.). Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm" title="All the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before you.">Psalm 22:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But did not the event, it may be asked, fall far short of the anticipations of prophet and Psalmist? They looked for a triumphant return of Israel and a visible manifestation of Jehovahâ€™s glory, to be followed immediately by the submission of the nations. As a matter of fact the return was an insignificant event, and no startling results immediately followed it. The answer is twofold. The spiritual significance of the Return for the history of the world could not be exaggerated; and prophecy constantly combines in one view the nearer and the remoter future, depicting the eventual result, without indicating the steps by which it is to be reached.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/102.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the people</span> (rather, <span class="accented">the peoples</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6, 7, 18</a>, etc). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/102.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; we are told what will take place when that which is expected in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-14.htm">Psalm 102:14</a> comes to pass, and at the same time the fulfilment of that which is longed for is thereby urged home upon God: Jahve's own honour depends upon it, since the restoration of Jerusalem will become the means of the conversion of the world - a fundamental thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> (cf. more particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>), which is also called to mind in the expression of this strophe. This prophetic prospect (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1-5</a>) that the restoration of Jerusalem will take place simultaneously with the glorious parusia of Jahve re-echoes here in a lyric form. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-17.htm">Psalm 102:17</a>, states the ground of the reverence, just as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-20.htm">Psalm 102:20</a> the ground of the praise.

In the mirror of this and of other Psalms written in times of affliction the Israel of the Exile saw itself reflected. </body></html>
