Here is a prayer put into the hands of the afflicted; let them present it to God. Even good men may be almost overwhelmed with afflictions. It is our duty and interest to pray; and it is comfort to an afflicted spirit to unburden itself, by a humble representation of its griefs. We must say, Blessed be the name of the Lord, who both gives and takes away.

The reading &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1511;&#1491; (in the Karaite Ben-Jerucham) enriches the lexicon in the same sense with a word which has scarcely had any existence. &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1491; (Arabic mauk&#803;id) signifies here, as in other instances, a hearth. &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>, Niphal: my bones are heated through with a fever-heat, as a hearth with the smouldering fire that is on it. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. &#1497;&#1490;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>) is used exactly as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>.
