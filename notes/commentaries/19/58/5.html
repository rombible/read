We should thank the Lord for merciful restraints; we should be more earnest in seeking renewing grace, more watchful over ourselves, and more patient under the effects of fallen nature in others. The corruption of their nature was the root of bitterness. We may see in children the wickedness of the world beginning. They go astray from God and their duty as soon as possibly they can. And how soon will little children tell lies! It is our duty to take pains to teach them, and above all, earnestly to pray for converting grace to make our children new creatures. Though the poison be within, much of it may be kept from breaking forth to injure others. When the Saviour's words are duly regarded, the serpent becomes harmless. But those who refuse to hear heavenly wisdom, must perish miserably, for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers - The word rendered "charmers" - &#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;  lachash - means properly "whisperers, mutterers," and it refers here to those who made use of spells or incantations - sorcerers or magicians. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>. These incantations were accompanied usually with a low, muttering sound, or with a gentle whisper, as if for the purpose of calming and controlling the object of the incantation. Such charmers of serpents (or pretended charmers) abounded among the ancients, and still abound in India. The art is carried in India to great perfection; and there are multitudes of persons who obtain a livelihood by this pretended or real power over venomous serpents. Their living is obtained either by "exhibiting" their power over serpents which they carry with them in their peregrinations, or by "drawing" them by their incantations from the walls of gardens, houses, and hedges, where they had taken up their abode. Multitudes of facts, referred to by those who have resided in India, seem to confirm the opinion that this power is real.<p>Charming never so wisely - Margin, "Be the charmer never so cunning." The word rendered here "charming" - &#1495;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;  chober - means properly to bind; to bind together. The "literal" meaning of the original Hebrew is, "binding spells that are wise," or, that are "cunning;" in other words, making use of the most cunning or skillful of their incantations and charms. The meaning is, that the utmost skill of enchantment will be unsuccessful. They are beyond the reach of any such arts. So with the people referred to by David. They were malignant and venomous; and nothing would disarm them of their malignity, and destroy their venom. What is here affirmed of these men is true in a certain sense of all people. The depravity of the human heart is such that nothing that man can employ will subdue it. No eloquence, no persuasion, no commands, no remonstrances, no influence that man can exert, will subdue it.<p>It cannot be charmed down; it cannot be removed by any skill or power of man, however great. The following remarks from Dr. Thomson, who has spent twenty years in Palestine (land and the Book, vol. i. pp. 221-223), will illustrate this passage: "I have seen many serpent-charmers who do really exercise some extraordinary power over these reptiles. They carry enormous snakes, generally black, about them, allow them to crawl all over their persons and into their bosoms; always, however, with certain precautions, either necessary, or pretended to be so. They repeatedly breathe strongly into the face of the serpent, and occasionally blow spittle, or some medicated composition upon them. It is needless to describe the mountebank tricks which they perform. That which I am least able to account for is the power of detecting the presence of serpents in a house, and of enticing or 'charming' them out of it. The thing is far too common to be made a matter of scepticism. The following account, by Mr. Lane, is a fair statement of this matter: 'The charmer professes to discover, without ocular perception (but perhaps he does so by a unique smell), whether there be any serpents in the house, and if there be, to attract them to him, as the fowler, by the fascination of his voice, allures the bird into his net.<p>As the serpent seeks the darkest place in which to hide himself, the charmer has, in most eases, to exercise his skill in an obscure chamber, where he might easily take a serpent from his bosom, bring it to the people without the door, and affirm that he had found it in the apartment, for no one would venture to enter with him, after having been assured of the presence of one of these reptiles within. But he is often required to perform in the full light of day, surrounded by spectators; and incredulous persons have searched him beforehand, and even stripped him naked, yet his success has been complete. He assumes an air of mystery, strikes the walls with a short palm-stick, whistles, makes a clucking noise with his tongue, and spits upon the ground, and generally says - I adjure you, by God, if ye be above or if ye be below, that ye come forth; I adjure you by the most great name, if ye be obedient, come forth, and if ye be disobedient, die! die! die!' The serpent is generally dislodged by his stick from a fissure in the wall or from the ceiling of the room.<p>I have heard it asserted that a serpent-charmer, before he enters a house in which he is to try his skill, always employs a servant of that house to introduce one or more serpents; but I have known instances in which this could not be the case, and am inclined to believe that the dervishes above mentioned are generally acquainted with some physical means of discovering the presence of serpents without seeing them, and of attracting them from their lurking-places. What these 'physical means' may be is yet a secret, as also the 'means' by which persons can handle live scorpions, and can put them into their bosom without fear or injury. I have seen this done again and again, even by small boys. This has always excited my curiosity and astonishment, for scorpions are the most malignant and irascible of all insects. The Hindoos, and after them the Egyptians, are the most famous snake-charmers, scorpion-eaters, etc., etc., although gipsies, Arabs, and others are occasionally found, who gain a vagabond livelihood by strolling round the country, and confounding the ignorant with these feats." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. stoppeth her&#8212;literally, "his."<p>ear&#8212;that is, the wicked man (the singular used collectively), who thus becomes like the deaf adder which has no ear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/58.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This similitude doth neither justify the practice of charming, which, in the very word here used, is condemned, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-11.htm" title="Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.">Deu 18:11</a></span>, no more than those which are drawn from the unjust steward, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-1.htm" title="And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.">Luke 16:1</a></span>, &c.; <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-2.htm" title="Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:">Luke 18:2</a></span>, &c., and from <span class="ital">a thief</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-15.htm" title="Behold, I come as a thief.

Or "that use enchantments", to enchant serpents, by muttering certain words, or by magical songs; by which means it is said that they have been drawn out of their holes, or caused to fly, or have become stupefied, and have lost their poison, and even burst asunder; as Bochart (b) relates from Pliny, Aelianus, Lucan, Isidore, Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and others: but an "asp" is unmoved by enchantments, and they are of no avail against its bites and poison (c). Nor do these words suppose that the psalmist approved of enchantments, or affirms the virtue of them to be real, but rather suggests the contrary; he only takes his similitude from the seeming deafness and disregard of serpents to enchantments, to set forth the obstinacy of wicked men: and their resolution to continue in their wicked ways; like the serpent that disregards men: <p>charming never so wisely; being "wise, skilful" (d), or made wise in enchanting enchantments; one very learned and expert in the art; or in "associating associations, skilful" (e): who makes a consort of magical words to obtain his point, as some think; or because by his enchantments he associates and gathers many serpents together, and tames them; or because he does this by society and fellowship with the devil; methods no ways approved of by the psalmist, only alluded to. It may perhaps better be rendered, "which will not hearken to the voice of the eloquent, putting things together ever so wisely": the word is used for an eloquent orator, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a>. Such Gospel ministers are, who are mighty in the Scriptures. The voice of the Gospel is a charming voice; it publishes good news and glad tidings; it is a voice of love, grace, and mercy, of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation by Christ; and is wisely charmed when it gives no uncertain sound, is all of a piece, and is faithfully preached, as it was by the apostles of Christ; who, as wise men, laid him as the foundation of eternal life and salvation; and especially as it was preached by Christ himself, who spake as never man did: and yet, such were the hardness and obstinacy of the wicked Jews, that they stopped their ears to his ministry, nor would they suffer others to attend upon it; and so it is now: which shows the insufficiency of the best means of themselves, and the necessity of powerful and efficacious grace, to work upon the hearts of men. <p>(b) Hierozoic. par. 2. l. 2. c. 6. col. 390.

The perfect in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a> is the perfect of certainty; the other perfects state what preceded and is now changed into the destruction of the crafty ones themselves. If the clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1507; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is rendered: my soul was bowed down (cf. &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm">Psalm 109:22</a>), it forms no appropriate corollary to the crafty laying of snares. Hence kpp must be taken as transitive: he had bowed down my soul; the change of number in the mention of the enemies is very common in the Psalms relating to these trials, whether it be that the poet has one enemy &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; before his mind or comprehends them all in one. Even the lxx renders &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, it is true, as though it were &#1493;&#1499;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;, but can scarcely have read it thus. This line is still remarkable; one would expect for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a> a thought parallel with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>, and perhaps the poet wrote &#1499;&#1508;&#1507; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, his (the net-layer's) own soul bends (viz., in order to fall into the net). Then &#1499;&#1508;&#1507; like &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; would be praet. confidentiae. In this certainty, to express which the music here becomes triumphantly forte, David's heart is confident, cheerful (Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;), and a powerful inward impulse urges him to song and harp. Although &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; may signify ready, equipped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>), yet this meaning is to be rejected here in view of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a> : it is not appropriate to the emphatic repetition of the word. His evening mood which found expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>, was hope of victory; the morning mood into which David here transports himself, is certainty of victory. He calls upon his soul to awake (&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-13.htm">Psalm 30:13</a>), he calls upon harp and cithern to awake (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1493;&#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; with one article that avails for both words, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; with the accent on the ultima on account of the coming together of two aspirates), from which he has not parted even though a fugitive; with the music of stringed instruments and with song he will awake the not yet risen dawn, the sun still slumbering in its chamber: &#1488;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, expergefaciam (not expergiscar), as e.g., in Sol 2:7, and as Ovid (Metam. xi. 597) says of the cock, evocat auroram.<p>(Note: With reference to the above passage in the Psalms, the Talmud, B. Berachoth 3b, says, "A cithern used to hang above David's bed; and when midnight came, the north wind blew among the strings, so that they sounded of themselves; and forthwith he arose and busied himself with the Tra until the pillar of the dawn (&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;) ascended." Rashi observes, "The dawn awakes the other kings; but I, said David, will awake the dawn (&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;).")<p>His song of praise, however, shall not resound in a narrow space where it is scarcely heard; he will step forth as the evangelist of his deliverance and of his Deliverer in the world of nations (&#1489;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; and the parallel word, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-4.htm">Psalm 108:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/149-7.htm">Psalm 149:7</a>, is to be written &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; with Lamed raphatum and Metheg before it); his vocation extends beyond Israel, and the events of his life are to be for the benefit of mankind. Here we perceive the self-consciousness of a comprehensive mission, which accompanied David from the beginning to the end of his royal career (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>). What is expressed in v. 11 is both motive and theme of the discourse among the peoples, viz., God's mercy and truth which soar high as the heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>). That they extend even to the heavens is only an earthly conception of their infinity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>). In the refrain, v. 12, which only differs in one letter from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>, the Psalm comes back to the language of prayer. Heaven and earth have a mutually involved history, and the blessed, glorious end of this history is the sunrise of the divine doxa over both, here prayed for. </body></html>
