We may, in faith, pray against the designs of the enemies of the church. He foretells their ruin. And who knows the power of God's anger? The victories of the Just One, in his own person and that of his servants, over the enemies of man's salvation, produce a joy which springs not from revenge, but from a view of the Divine mercy, justice, and truth, shown in the redemption of the elect, the punishment of the ungodly, and the fulfilment of the promises. Whoever duly considers these things, will diligently seek the reward of righteousness, and adore the Providence which orders all thing aright in heaven and in earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away - Or rather, As the snail which melteth as it goes; that is, which leaves a slimy trail as it moves along, and thus melts away the more as it advances, until at length it dies.

As a snail when it comes out of its shell liquefies, drops its moisture, and with it makes a "path", from whence it has its name  in the Hebrew language; and so the Targum here, <p>"as the snail moistens its way;'' <p>which moistness it gradually exhausts, and melts away, and dies: so the psalmist prays that everyone of his enemies might die in like manner. Some think reference is had to the snail's putting out its horns to no purpose when in danger, and apply it to the vain threatenings of the wicked; a strange difference this, between a roaring young lion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>, and a melting snail. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, render it, "as wax which melteth": see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>; <p>like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>. The Targum is, <p>"as an abortive and a mole, which are blind and see not the sun.'' <p>So Jarchi renders it a "mole", agreeably to the Talmud (g). Or, "let them not see the sun" (h); let them die, and never see the sun in the firmament any more; Christ, the sun of righteousness; nor enjoy the favour of God, and the light of his countenance; nor have the light of life, or eternal glory and happiness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-19.htm">Psalm 49:19</a>. <p>(g) T.
