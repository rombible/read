We should thank the Lord for merciful restraints; we should be more earnest in seeking renewing grace, more watchful over ourselves, and more patient under the effects of fallen nature in others. The corruption of their nature was the root of bitterness. We may see in children the wickedness of the world beginning. They go astray from God and their duty as soon as possibly they can. And how soon will little children tell lies! It is our duty to take pains to teach them, and above all, earnestly to pray for converting grace to make our children new creatures. Though the poison be within, much of it may be kept from breaking forth to injure others. When the Saviour's words are duly regarded, the serpent becomes harmless. But those who refuse to hear heavenly wisdom, must perish miserably, for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/58.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, in heart ye work wickedness - Whatever might be the outward appearances, whatever pretences they might make to just judgment, yet in fact their hearts were set on wickedness, and they were conscious of doing wrong.<p>Ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth - It is difficult to attach any meaning to this language; the translators evidently felt that they could not express the meaning of the original; and they, therefore, gave what seems to be a literal translation of the Hebrew. The Septuagint renders it, "In heart you work iniquity in the land; your hands weave together iniquity." The Latin Vulgate: "In heart you work iniquity; in the land your hands prepare injustice." Luther: "Yea, willingly do you work iniquity in the land, and go straight through to work evil with your hands." Professor Alexander: "In the land, the violence of your hands ye weigh." Perhaps the true translation of the whole verse would be, "Yea, in heart ye work iniquity in the land; ye weigh (weigh out) the violence of your hands;" that is, the deeds of violence or wickedness which your hands commit. The idea of "weighing" them, or "weighing them out," is derived from the administration of justice. In all lands people are accustomed to speak of "weighing out" justice; to symbolize its administration by scales and balances; and to express the doing of it as holding an even balance. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-6.htm">Job 31:6</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-27.htm">Daniel 5:27</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-5.htm">Revelation 6:5</a>, note. Thus interpreted, this verse refers, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-1.htm">Psalm 58:1</a>, to the act of pronouncing judgment; and the idea is that instead of pronouncing a just judgment - of holding an equal balance - they determined in favor of violence - of acts of oppression and wrong to be committed by their own hands. That which they weighed out, or dispensed, was not a just sentence, but violence, wrong, injustice, crime. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/58.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

So far were they from speaking righteousness, and judging uprightly. The heart of man is wickedness itself; it is desperately wicked, and is the shop in which all wickedness is wrought; for sinful acts are committed there as well as by the tongue and hand, as follows. This phrase also denotes their sinning; not with precipitancy, and through surprise; but with premeditation and deliberation; and their doing it heartily, with good will, and with allowance, and their continuance and constant persisting in it; <p>ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth; they were guilty of acts of violence and oppression, which, of all men, judges should not be guilty of; whose business it is to plead the cause of the injured and oppressed, to right their wrongs, and to protect and defend them: these they pretended to weigh in the balance of justice and equity, and committed them under a show of righteousness; they decreed unrighteous decrees, and framed mischief by a law; and this they did openly, and everywhere, throughout the whole land. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/58.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> your hands in the earth.</span><p>(b) You are not ashamed to execute that cruelty publicly, which you have imagined in your hearts.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/58.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Yea</span>] Or, Nay, for the particle implies a negative answer, and an additional accusation.

The perfect in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a> is the perfect of certainty; the other perfects state what preceded and is now changed into the destruction of the crafty ones themselves. If the clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1507; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is rendered: my soul was bowed down (cf. &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm">Psalm 109:22</a>), it forms no appropriate corollary to the crafty laying of snares. Hence kpp must be taken as transitive: he had bowed down my soul; the change of number in the mention of the enemies is very common in the Psalms relating to these trials, whether it be that the poet has one enemy &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; before his mind or comprehends them all in one. Even the lxx renders &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, it is true, as though it were &#1493;&#1499;&#1508;&#1508;&#1493;, but can scarcely have read it thus. This line is still remarkable; one would expect for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a> a thought parallel with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm">Psalm 57:7</a>, and perhaps the poet wrote &#1499;&#1508;&#1507; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, his (the net-layer's) own soul bends (viz., in order to fall into the net). Then &#1499;&#1508;&#1507; like &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; would be praet. confidentiae. In this certainty, to express which the music here becomes triumphantly forte, David's heart is confident, cheerful (Symmachus &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;), and a powerful inward impulse urges him to song and harp. Although &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; may signify ready, equipped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>), yet this meaning is to be rejected here in view of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a> : it is not appropriate to the emphatic repetition of the word. His evening mood which found expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>, was hope of victory; the morning mood into which David here transports himself, is certainty of victory. He calls upon his soul to awake (&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-13.htm">Psalm 30:13</a>), he calls upon harp and cithern to awake (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1493;&#1499;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; with one article that avails for both words, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; with the accent on the ultima on account of the coming together of two aspirates), from which he has not parted even though a fugitive; with the music of stringed instruments and with song he will awake the not yet risen dawn, the sun still slumbering in its chamber: &#1488;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, expergefaciam (not expergiscar), as e.g., in Sol 2:7, and as Ovid (Metam. xi. 597) says of the cock, evocat auroram.<p>(Note: With reference to the above passage in the Psalms, the Talmud, B. Berachoth 3b, says, "A cithern used to hang above David's bed; and when midnight came, the north wind blew among the strings, so that they sounded of themselves; and forthwith he arose and busied himself with the Tra until the pillar of the dawn (&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;) ascended." Rashi observes, "The dawn awakes the other kings; but I, said David, will awake the dawn (&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;).")<p>His song of praise, however, shall not resound in a narrow space where it is scarcely heard; he will step forth as the evangelist of his deliverance and of his Deliverer in the world of nations (&#1489;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; and the parallel word, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-4.htm">Psalm 108:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/149-7.htm">Psalm 149:7</a>, is to be written &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; with Lamed raphatum and Metheg before it); his vocation extends beyond Israel, and the events of his life are to be for the benefit of mankind. Here we perceive the self-consciousness of a comprehensive mission, which accompanied David from the beginning to the end of his royal career (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>). What is expressed in v. 11 is both motive and theme of the discourse among the peoples, viz., God's mercy and truth which soar high as the heavens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>). That they extend even to the heavens is only an earthly conception of their infinity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>). In the refrain, v. 12, which only differs in one letter from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>, the Psalm comes back to the language of prayer. Heaven and earth have a mutually involved history, and the blessed, glorious end of this history is the sunrise of the divine doxa over both, here prayed for. </body></html>
