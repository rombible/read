The first of these compares him to water, which, spilt on a sandy soil, sinks into it and melts away. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm" title="For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.">2Samuel 14:14</a>.) Perhaps a phenomenon, often described by travellers, was in the poet’s mind, the disappearance of a stream which, after accompanying the track for some time, suddenly sinks into the sand. The words <span class= "ital">which run continually, </span>even if the Hebrew can bear this meaning, only weaken the figure. The verb is in the reflexive conjugation, and has “to” or “for themselves” added, and seems to be exactly equivalent to our, <span class= "ital">they walk themselves off. </span>This certainly should be joined to the clause following. Here, too, we must suppose that the sign of comparison, <span class= "ital">khemô, </span>was dropped out by the copyist in consequence of the <span class= "ital">lāmô</span> just written, and afterwards being inserted in the margin, got misplaced. We must bring it back, and read:<p>They are utterly gone, as when<p>One shoots his arrows.<p>This figure thus becomes also clear and striking. The arrow once shot is irrevocably gone, probably lost, fit emblem of the fate of the wicked. For the ellipse in <span class= "ital">bend </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">tread, </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-12.htm" title="If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready.">Psalm 7:12</a>), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm" title="Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:">Psalm 64:3</a>, where also the action properly belonging to the <span class= "ital">bow </span>is transferred to the <span class= "ital">arrow.</span><p>The words, “Let them be as cut in pieces,” must be carried on to the following verse, which contains two fresh images: <span class= "ital">So they are cut off </span>(LXX., “are weak “) <span class= "ital">as shablûl melts; </span>(<span class= "ital">as</span>)<span class= "ital"> the abortion of a woman passes away without seeing the sun. </span>The word <span class= "ital">shablûl, </span>by its derivation (<span class= "ital">bālal = to pour out</span>) may mean any <span class= "ital">liquid </span>or <span class= "ital">moist </span>substance. Hence some understand <span class= "ital">a watercourse, </span>others (LXX. and Vulg.) <span class= "ital">wax. </span>The first would weaken the passage by introducing a bald repetition of a previous image. The second is quite intelligible. But the Talmud says <span class= "ital">shablûl </span>is a <span class= "ital">slug </span>or <span class= "ital">shelless snail, </span>and there may be a reference in the passage to the popular notion derived from the slimy track of the creature, that the slug dissolves as it moves, and eventually melts away. Dr. Tristram, however (<span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. Bib., </span>p. 295), finds scientific support for the image in the myriads of snail shells found in the Holy Land, still adhering, by the calcareous exudation round the orifice, to the surface of the rock, while the animal itself is utterly shrivelled and wasted. The last image presents no difficulty either in language or form, except that the form of the noun <span class= "ital">woman </span>is unusual.<p><span class= "bld">That they may not.</span>—That this refers to the abortion which <span class= "ital">passed away without seeing the sun, </span>is certain. The grammatical difficulty of want of concord may be got over by taking <span class= "ital">abortion </span>as a collective noun.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/psalms/58.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-7.htm" title="Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bends his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.">Psalm 58:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let them melt away as waters, </span>&c. — As waters arising from melted snow, or great showers, or some other extraordinary cause, which at first run with great force and noise, and throw down all that stands in their way, but are suddenly gone, and run away, and vanish, and return no more. <span class="ital">When he — </span>Saul, or any, or every one of mine enemies, as appears from the foregoing or following words; <span class="ital">bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows — </span>Taking his aim at the upright in heart; <span class="ital">let them — </span>That is, his arrows, <span class="ital">be cut in pieces — </span>Let them be like arrows broken, while a man is shooting them.

We may, in faith, pray against the designs of the enemies of the church. He foretells their ruin. And who knows the power of God's anger? The victories of the Just One, in his own person and that of his servants, over the enemies of man's salvation, produce a joy which springs not from revenge, but from a view of the Divine mercy, justice, and truth, shown in the redemption of the elect, the punishment of the ungodly, and the fulfilment of the promises.
