It is an excellent plan to fill up all our spare minutes with pious meditations, and prayers and praises. No time would then be a burden, nor should we murder our hours by trifling conversation and vain amusements, or by carnal indulgences. We need desire no more to make us happy, than to be blessed of the Lord. We ought to beg spiritual blessings, not only for ourselves, but for others; not only, The Lord bless me, but, The Lord bless thee; thus testifying our belief that there is enough for others as well as for us, and showing our good will to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/134.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lift up your hands in the sanctuary - Margin, In holiness.

In Zion, His chosen and beloved dwelling-place, Jahve blesses everything that belongs to her temporal need (&#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; for &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>, note); so that her poor do not suffer want, for divine love loves the poor most especially. His second blessing refers to the priests, for by means of these He will keep up His intercourse with His people. He makes the priesthood of Zion a real institution of salvation: He clothes her priests with salvation, so that they do not merely bring it about instrumentally, but personally possess it, and their whole outward appearance is one which proclaims salvation. And to all her saints He gives cause and matter for high and lasting joy, by making Himself known also to the church, in which He has taken up His abode, in deeds of mercy (loving-kindness or grace). There (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>) in Zion is indeed the kingship of promise, which cannot fail of fulfilment. He will cause a horn to shoot forth, He will prepare a lamp, for the house of David, which David here represents as being its ancestor and the anointed one of God reigning at that time; and all who hostilely rise up against David in his seed, He will cover with shame as with a garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-22.htm">Job 8:22</a>), and the crown consecrated by promise, which the seed of David wears, shall blossom like an unfading wreath. The horn is an emblem of defensive might and victorious dominion, and the lamp (&#1504;&#1512;,    <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>, cf. &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a>, lxx &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) an emblem of brilliant dignity and joyfulness. In view of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>, of the predictions concerning the Branch (zemach) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>), and of the fifteenth Beracha of the Shemone-Esre (the daily Jewish prayer consisting of eighteen benedictions): "make the branch (zemach) of David Thy servant to shoot forth speedily, and let his horn rise high by virtue of Thy salvation," - it is hardly to be doubted that the poet attached a Messianic meaning to this promise. With reference to our Psalm, Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, changes that supplicatory beracha of his nation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68-70</a>) into a praiseful one, joyfully anticipating the fulfilment that is at hand in Jesus. </body></html>
