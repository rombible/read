It is an excellent plan to fill up all our spare minutes with pious meditations, and prayers and praises. No time would then be a burden, nor should we murder our hours by trifling conversation and vain amusements, or by carnal indulgences. We need desire no more to make us happy, than to be blessed of the Lord. We ought to beg spiritual blessings, not only for ourselves, but for others; not only, The Lord bless me, but, The Lord bless thee; thus testifying our belief that there is enough for others as well as for us, and showing our good will to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/134.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord that made heaven and earth - The great Creator of all things. This is probably the language of those who were thus employed in the service of the Lord at night; their response to the address in the first two verses.<p>Bless thee out of Zion - That is, bless those who thus approached the sanctuary, and called on those within to praise the Lord. This is the answer. Let the blessing of God rest on you. It is language showing that they appreciated the kind and encouraging salutation, and that they reciprocated the feelings and the good wishes of those who came to worship. In the name of the Lord whom they served, therefore, and appealing to him, they pronounced a blessing on those who thus approached the sanctuary. People do not come near the house of God - the place of public worship - with kind and sympathizing feelings without a blessing from the sanctuary, without a response that welcomes them, and that meets all their aspirations. There is always in Zion - in the church - a voice, by day and night, which pronounces a blessing on those who wish it well, who seek its good, and who desire to partake of the favor of God.<p>Out of Zion - That is, may God speak to you out of Zion; may he confer on you such blessings as properly go out of Zion; or such as Zion (or his church) can furnish. Go not away unblessed; go not without a token of divine favor - for God will bless you. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/134.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

These are not the words of the priests blessing the people in this form, as some; but rather, as others, the wish of the servants of the Lord, that he would bless him that exhorted them to this service; whether one of the priests, or the captain of the temple, or the psalmist: though, according to Kimchi, and which seems agreeable, they are the words of the psalmist, promising a blessing from the Lord to those that blessed him; as an encouragement to them, to everyone of them, to be constant and diligent in this service. For so it may be rendered, "the Lord shall bless thee" (f); all blessings come from the Lord, whether spiritual or temporal; and are to be asked of him, and expected from him: and the blessings here promised or asked for are blessings out of Zion, the church, where God blesses his people with his word and ordinances, with his presence, and with communion with himself. Wherefore it is good to be there waiting on him and worshipping him, praying to him and praising of him; and he that made heaven and earth is able to bless both with heavenly and earthly things: and this description of the Lord is no doubt given to encourage faith in him; for, what is it he cannot do? <p>(f) "benedicet tibi", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Cocceius, Gejerus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/134.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD that <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.</span><p>(c) And therefore has all power, bless you with his fatherly love declared in Zion.

In Zion, His chosen and beloved dwelling-place, Jahve blesses everything that belongs to her temporal need (&#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; for &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, vid., on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>, note); so that her poor do not suffer want, for divine love loves the poor most especially. His second blessing refers to the priests, for by means of these He will keep up His intercourse with His people. He makes the priesthood of Zion a real institution of salvation: He clothes her priests with salvation, so that they do not merely bring it about instrumentally, but personally possess it, and their whole outward appearance is one which proclaims salvation. And to all her saints He gives cause and matter for high and lasting joy, by making Himself known also to the church, in which He has taken up His abode, in deeds of mercy (loving-kindness or grace). There (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>) in Zion is indeed the kingship of promise, which cannot fail of fulfilment. He will cause a horn to shoot forth, He will prepare a lamp, for the house of David, which David here represents as being its ancestor and the anointed one of God reigning at that time; and all who hostilely rise up against David in his seed, He will cover with shame as with a garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-22.htm">Job 8:22</a>), and the crown consecrated by promise, which the seed of David wears, shall blossom like an unfading wreath. The horn is an emblem of defensive might and victorious dominion, and the lamp (&#1504;&#1512;,    <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>, cf. &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a>, lxx &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) an emblem of brilliant dignity and joyfulness. In view of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>, of the predictions concerning the Branch (zemach) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>), and of the fifteenth Beracha of the Shemone-Esre (the daily Jewish prayer consisting of eighteen benedictions): "make the branch (zemach) of David Thy servant to shoot forth speedily, and let his horn rise high by virtue of Thy salvation," - it is hardly to be doubted that the poet attached a Messianic meaning to this promise. With reference to our Psalm, Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, changes that supplicatory beracha of his nation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68-70</a>) into a praiseful one, joyfully anticipating the fulfilment that is at hand in Jesus. </body></html>
