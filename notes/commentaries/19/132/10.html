In the original (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm" title="O LORD God, turn not away the face of your anointed: remember the mercies of David your servant.">2Chronicles 6:42</a>) it is of course Solomon who prays for himself; here (see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>) we must naturally think of one of the Asmonean princes. The expression “to turn away the face,” of a suppliant, instead of “turning from him,” is borrowed from court etiquette. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-16.htm" title="And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.">1Kings 2:16</a>, margin.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>132:1-10 David bound himself to find a place for the Lord, for the ark, the token of God's presence. When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/132.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thy servant David's sake - Because of the promise made to him; because of the zeal which he has shown in securing a place for the ark. Let it not be in vain that he has shown such a regard to the honor of God; let not the promises made to him fail. Such a prayer is proper now. There is nothing wrong in our beseeching God to carry out and accomplish the purposes cherished by his church for promoting the honor of his name; or for a child to pray that the purposes of a pious parent in regard to himself may not fail. It is an expression of nature - a desire that the labor and sacrifices of those who have gone before us should not be lost. This is the language of the author of the psalm, and of those for whom the psalm was composed. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-1.htm">Psalm 132:1</a>. In view of all that David has done, do thou now show favor and mercy.<p>Turn not away the face of thine anointed - As if in displeasure, or in forgetfulness. The word anointed would refer to one who was set apart as a king, a priest, or a prophet. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. The word would be applicable to David himself, as the anointed king; in a higher sense it is applicable to the Messiah, the Christ. The reference here is probably to David himself, as if a failure to carry out his purposes in regard to the sanctuary, or to fulfill the promises made to him, would be a turning away the face from him; would be a mark of the divine displeasure against him. The prayer is, that God would carry out those purposes as if his face was continually turned with benignity and favor toward David. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/132.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-12.

Not for any virtues, or excellencies or merits, of David, literally understood; rather for the sake of the covenant and promises made with him: but for the sake of the antitypical David, the Messiah, the son of David according to the flesh, and the servant of the Lord as Mediator; for whose sake, and in whose name, prayers and supplications are made and presented; <p>turn not away the face of thine anointed; not David; rather Solomon, as the Targum expresses it; so Jarchi: but any of the Lord's anointed, every Christian, or believer in Christ, is an anointed one; and has received the unction from the Holy One, the oil of true grace. And the request is, that God would not turn such away from him, and cause them to depart from his throne of grace, ashamed and disappointed; but hear and answer their petitions, for his Son's sake. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>; it is added, "remember the mercies of David thy servant"; the kind and good things promised to him, and perform them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/132.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For thy <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</span><p>(g) As you first made promise to David, so continue it to his posterity that whatever they ask for their people, it may be granted.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/132.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. This verse is still part of the people’s prayer, though its language is coloured by the feeling of the Psalmist’s own age, and expresses the perplexity of a time in which Jehovah seemed to have disowned His anointed. The people pray for a blessing on each successive king for David’s sake. <span class="ital">Thine anointed</span> is not David only, but David and his successors, Jehovah’s anointed king for the time being. For him the people pray that Jehovah will not ‘turn away his face,’ i.e. repulse his requests or banish him from His favour and presence. For the phrase cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-16.htm" title="And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.">1 Kings 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-24.htm" title="How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?">2 Kings 18:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-9.htm" title="Behold, O God our shield, and look on the face of your anointed.">Psalm 84:9</a>. The thought corresponds to the promise so prominent in 2 Samuel 7, that David’s house should be established ‘before Jehovah’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, read ‘before <span class="ital">me’ </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/7-26.htm" title="And let your name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of your servant David be established before you....">2 Samuel 7:26; 2Sa 7:29</a>).

It is the post-Davidic church which here reminds Jahve of the hereinafter mentioned promises (of the "mercies of David," <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>) with which He has responded to David's &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. By this verbal substantive of the Pual is meant all the care and trouble which David had in order to procure a worthy abode for the sanctuary of Jahve. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489; signifies to trouble or harass one's self about anything, afflictari (as frequently in the Book of Ecclesiastes); the Pual here denotes the self-imposed trouble, or even that imposed by outward circumsntaces, such as the tedious wars, of long, unsuccessful, and yet never relaxed endeavours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>). For he had vowed unto God that he would give himself absolutely no rest until he had obtained a fixed abode for Jahve. What he said to Nathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>) is an indication of this vowed resolve, which was now in a time of triumphant peace, as it seemed, ready for being carried out, after the first step towards it had already been taken in the removal of the Ark of the covenant to Zion (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>); for <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> is appended to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a> out of its chronological order and only on account of the internal connection. After the bringing home of the Ark, which had been long yearned for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-2.htm">Psalm 101:2</a>), and did not take place without difficulties and terrors, was accomplished, a series of years again passed over, during which David always carried about with him the thought of erecting God a Temple-building. And when he had received the tidings through Nathan that he should not build God a house, but that it should be done by his son and successor, he nevertheless did as much towards the carrying out of the desire of his heart as was possible in connection with this declaration of the will of Jahve. He consecrated the site of the future Temple, he procured the necessary means and materials for the building of it, he made all the necessary arrangements for the future Temple-service, he inspirited the people for the gigantic work of building that was before them, and handed over to his son the model for it, as it is all related to us in detail by the chronicler. The divine name "the mighty One of Jacob" is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>. The Philistines with their Dagon had been made to feel this mighty Rock of Jacob when they took the sacred Ark along with them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-12</a>). With &#1488;&#1501; David solemnly declares what he is resolved not to do. The meaning of the hyperbolically expressed vow in the form of an oath is that for so long he will not rejoice at his own dwelling-house, nor give himself up to sleep that is free from anxiety; in fine, for so long he will not rest. The genitives after &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; are appositional genitives; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a> delights in similar combinations of synonyms. &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (Latin strata mea) is a poetical plural, as also is &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. With &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (which is always said of the eyelids, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>, not of the eyes) alternates &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; (according to another reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;) for &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;. The a&#772;th is the same as in &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>, cf. 60:13, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>, and frequently. This Aramaizing rejection of the syllable before the tone is, however, without example elsewhere. The lxx adds to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; &#1500;&#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;), but this is a disagreeable overloading of the verse. </body></html>
