When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/132.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Until I find out a place for the Lord - A place for the ark of God; a place where it may constantly and safely remain. The symbol of the divine presence rested on the mercy-seat, the cover of the ark, and hence, this was represented as the seat or the house of God.<p>An habitation for the mighty God of Jacob - Hebrew, "For the mighty One of Jacob." The reference is to a permanent dwelling-place for the ark. It had been moved from place to place. There was no house appropriated to it, or reared expressly for it, and David resolved to provide such a house - at first, a tent or tabernacle on Mount Zion - and then, a more spacious and magnificent structure, the temple. The latter he was not permitted to build, though the purpose was in his heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/132.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. habitation&#8212;literally, "dwellings," generally used to denote the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Until I find out a place for the Lord; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The "place" which David desired to "find" was a permanent resting-place for the ark of God, which he had already "brought up from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with gladness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>), but which he had only established in a temporary abode of the nature of a tent, or tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>). God approved David's zeal, but did not allow him to accomplish his design (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An habitation for the mighty God of Jacob</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Mighty One of Jacob</span> (comp. ver. 2 and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/131.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This little song is inscribed &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; because it is like an echo of the answer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-21.htm">2 Samuel 6:21</a>.) with which David repelled the mocking observation of Michal when he danced before the Ark in a linen ephod, and therefore not in kingly attire, but in the common raiment of the priests: I esteem myself still less than I now show it, and I appear base in mine own eyes. In general David is the model of the state of mind which the poet expresses here. He did not push himself forward, but suffered himself to be drawn forth out of seclusion. He did not take possession of the throne violently, but after Samuel has anointed him he willingly and patiently traverses the long, thorny, circuitous way of deep abasement, until he receives from God's hand that which God's promise had assured to him. The persecution by Saul lasted about ten years, and his kingship in Hebron, at first only incipient, seven years and a half. He left it entirely to God to remove Saul and Ishbosheth. He let Shimei curse. He left Jerusalem before Absalom. Submission to God's guidance, resignation to His dispensations, contentment with that which was allotted to him, are the distinguishing traits of his noble character, which the poet of this Psalm indirectly holds up to himself and to his contemporaries as a mirror, viz., to the Israel of the period after the Exile, which, in connection with small beginnings under difficult circumstances, had been taught humbly contented and calm waiting.<p>With &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; the poet repudiates pride as being the state of his soul; with &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; (lo-ramu&#772;' as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a>, and before Ajin, e.g., also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, in accordance with which the erroneous placing of the accent in Baer's text is to be corrected), pride of countenance and bearing; and with &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, pride of endeavour and mode of action. Pride has its seat in the heart, in the eyes especially it finds its expression, and great things are its sphere in which it diligently exercises itself. The opposite of "great things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>) is not that which is little, mean, but that which is small; and the opposite of "things too wonderful for me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>) is not that which is trivial, but that which is attainable.<p>&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488; does not open a conditional protasis, for where is the indication of the apodosis to be found? Nor does it signify "but," a meaning it also has not in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-38.htm">Genesis 24:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-6.htm">Ezekiel 3:6</a>. In these passages too, as in the passage before us, it is asseverating, being derived from the usual formula of an oath: verily I have, etc. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; signifies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-25.htm">Isaiah 28:25</a>) to level the surface of a field by ploughing it up, and has an ethical sense here, like &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; with its opposites &#1506;&#1511;&#1489; and &#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;. The Poel &#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; is to be understood according to &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a>. He has levelled or made smooth his soul, so that humility is its entire and uniform state; he has calmed it so that it is silent and at rest, and lets God speak and work in it and for it: it is like an even surface, and like the calm surface of a lake. Ewald and Hupfeld's rendering: "as a weaned child on its mother, so my soul, being weaned, lies on me," is refuted by the consideration that it ought at least to be &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, but more correctly &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;; but it is also besides opposed by the article which is swallowed up in &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;, according to which it is to be rendered: like one weaned beside its mother (here &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500; on account of the determinative collateral definition), like the weaned one (here &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500; because without any collateral definition: cf. with Hitzig, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>, and the like; moreover, also, because referring back to the first &#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>), is my soul beside me (Hitzig, Hengstenberg, and most expositors). As a weaned child - viz. not one that is only just begun to be weaned, but an actually weaned child (&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;, cognate &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; eta, to bring to an end, more particularly to bring suckling to an end, to wean) - lies upon its mother without crying impatiently and craving for its mother's breast, but contented with the fact that it has its mother - like such a weaned child is his soul upon him, i.e., in relation to his Ego (which is conceived of in &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; as having the soul upon itself, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-18.htm">Jeremiah 8:18</a>; Psychology, S. 151f., tr. p. 180): his soul, which is by nature restless and craving, is stilled; it does not long after earthly enjoyment and earthly good that God should give these to it, but it is satisfied in the fellowship of God, it finds full satisfaction in Him, it is satisfied (satiated) in Him.<p>By the closing strain, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/131-3.htm">Psalm 131:3</a>, the individual language of the Psalm comes to have a reference to the congregation at large. Israel is to renounce all self-boasting and all self-activity, and to wait in lowliness and quietness upon its God from now and for evermore. For He resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. </body></html>
