This allusion is rendered more probable by the use of the word rendered “flourish” (properly, <span class= "ital">shine</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>a cognate to which was the technical name given to this golden plate. (See the reference in Exodus 39, above.) It is also possibly alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm" title="You have made void the covenant of your servant: you have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.">Psalm 89:39</a>, the only other place in the psalms where the word occurs, though as the word is used of the royal crown in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm" title="So I stood on him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.">2Samuel 1:10</a>, &c, the allusion is not certain. But if the Maccabæan hypothesis is correct, the use of the word, instead of the more usual word for “crown,” is interesting. “One relic of the ancient insignia has been preserved, which was probably prized as the most precious of all. It was the golden plate affixed to the turban, inscribed ‘Holiness to Jehovah,’ which was believed to have come down from the time of Aaron, and which, treasured through all the vicissitudes of the Jewish state, was carried to Rome by Titus, and seen there by the great Jewish Rabbi, in the time of Hadrian” (Stanley, J. <span class= "ital">C. </span>3:353).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>132:11-18 The Lord never turns from us when we plead the covenant with his anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. How vast is the love of God to man, that he should speak thus concerning his church! It is his desire to dwell with us; yet how little do we desire to dwell with him! He abode in Zion till the sins of Israel caused him to give them up to the spoilers. Forsake us not, O God, and deliver us not in like manner, sinful though we are. God's people have a special blessing on common enjoyments, and that blessing puts peculiar sweetness into them. Zion's poor have reason to be content with a little of this world, because they have better things prepared for them. God will abundantly bless the nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the bread of life. He gives more than we ask, and when he gives salvation, he will give abundant joy. God would bring to nothing every design formed to destroy the house of David, until King Messiah should arise out of it, to sit upon the throne of his Father. In him all the promises centre. His enemies, who will not have him to reign over them, shall at the last day be clothed with shame and confusion for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/132.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His enemies will I clothe with shame - They shall be so confounded that shame shall seem to cover them as a garment. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-29.htm">Psalm 109:29</a>. That is, David would be triumphant.<p>But upon himself shall his crown flourish - His crown shall be as a fresh, blooming garland. The Hebrew word used here may mean either to glitter, or to flower, to fiourish or bloom. As applied to a crown, it may mean either that it would sparkle or glitter, as set with precious stones - or (under the idea of a garland) it may mean that it would appear to bloom or blossom. In either case it denotes success, joy, triumph - and is a promise of prosperity to David as a king. This was a part of the promise referred to by the psalmist, and a ground of the plea in the psalm. God had made these precious promises to David and his posterity; and now, in a time of sorrow and disaster, when the glory of the crown seemed about to pass away, the psalmist, in the name of the people, and in language to be used by the people, prays that those ancient promises might be remembered and fulfilled. So, in a time of general religious declension, we may plead the promises, so rich and so abundant, which God has made to his church, as a reason for his gracious interposition, for his coming to revive his work. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/132.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. make the horn &#8230; to bud&#8212;enlarge his power.<p>a lamp&#8212;the figure of prosperity (Ps 18:10, 28; 89:17).

(1) The word for ‘crown’ (<span class="ital">nçzer</span>) used here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm" title="You have made void the covenant of your servant: you have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.">Psalm 89:39</a>, means (<span class="ital">a</span>) ‘consecration,’ (<span class="ital">b</span>) ‘a crown’ or ‘diadem,’ as the mark of consecration to an office. It is used not only of a king’s crown, but of the high-priest’s diadem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm" title="And you shall put the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban.">Exodus 29:6</a>). (2) The verb <span class="ital">yâtsîts</span>, ‘flourish,’ or rather ‘sparkle,’ ‘glitter,’ is cognate to the word <span class="ital">tsîts</span>, which denotes the glittering plate of gold bearing the inscription “Holiness to Jehovah” which the High-priest wore on his turban, and which is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-30.htm" title="And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he comes into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.">Exodus 29:30</a>, “the plate of the holy diadem.” This phraseology seems intended to suggest that David’s representative will have high-priestly as well as royal dignity. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-21.htm" title="And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the middle of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach to me? said the LORD.">Jeremiah 30:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/6-11.htm" title="Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;...">Zechariah 6:11-13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/132.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His enemies will I clothe with shame</span>. David's "enemies" are those who oppress his "Seed," and will not have him to reign over them. All such will be "confounded and put to shame" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a>), "clothed with shame and dishonor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-26.htm">Psalm 35:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But upon himself shall his crown flourish.</span> The true and the final Davidic representative is Christ, who "remaineth a King forever" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-10.htm">Psalm 29:10</a>).

The first member of the verse closes with &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;, which has the distinctive Pazer, which is preceded by Legarmeh as a sub-distinctive; then follows at the head of the second member &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; with Zinnor, then &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; with Olewejored and its conjunctive Galgal, which regularly precedes after the sub-distinctive Zinnor. The suffix of &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; refers to that which was affirmed by oath, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>. Lineal descendants of David will Jahve place on the throne (&#1500;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; like &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>) to him, i.e., so that they shall follow his as possessors of the throne. David's children shall for ever (which has been finally fulfilled in Christ) sit &#1500;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; to him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-5.htm">Jeremiah 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a>). Thus has Jahve promised, and expects in return from the sons of David the observance of His Law. Instead of &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497; &#1494;&#1493;&#1468; it is pointed &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497; &#1494;&#1493;. In Hahn's edition &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497; has Mercha in the penult. (cf. the retreat of the tone in &#1494;&#1492; &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-17.htm">Daniel 10:17</a>), and in Baer's edition the still better attested reading Mahpach instead of the counter-tone Metheg, and Mercha on the ultima. It is not plural with a singular suffix (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59</a>, Ges. 91, 3), but, as &#1494;&#1493;  equals  &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; indicates, the singular for &#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, like &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8</a>; and signifies the revelation of God as an attestation of His will. &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1501; has Mercha mahpach., &#1494;&#1493; Rebia parvum, and &#1506;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497; Mercha; and according to the interpunction it would have to be rendered: "and My self-attestation there" (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>), but zow is relative: My self-attestation (revelation), which I teach them. The divine words extend to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-12.htm">Psalm 132:12</a>. The hypotheses with &#1488;&#1501;, as the fulfilment in history shows, were conditions of the continuity of the Davidic succession; not, however - because human unfaithfulness does not annul the faithfulness of God - of the endlessness of the Davidic throne. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13</a> the poet states the ground of such promissory mercy. It is based on the universal mercy of the election of Jerusalem. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; has He mappic. like &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>, or the stroke of Raphe (Ew. 247, d), although the suffix is not absolutely necessary. In the following strophe the purport of the election of Jerusalem is also unfolded in Jahve's own words. </body></html>
