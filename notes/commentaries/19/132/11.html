He abode in Zion till the sins of Israel caused him to give them up to the spoilers. Forsake us not, O God, and deliver us not in like manner, sinful though we are. God's people have a special blessing on common enjoyments, and that blessing puts peculiar sweetness into them. Zion's poor have reason to be content with a little of this world, because they have better things prepared for them. God will abundantly bless the nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the bread of life. He gives more than we ask, and when he gives salvation, he will give abundant joy. God would bring to nothing every design formed to destroy the house of David, until King Messiah should arise out of it, to sit upon the throne of his Father. In him all the promises centre.

"The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David." We cannot urge anything with God which is equal to his own word and oath. Jehovah swears that our faith may have strong confidence in it: he cannot forswear himself. He swears in truth, for he means every word that he utters; men may be perjured, but none will be so profane as to imagine this of the God of truth. By Nathan this covenant of Jehovah was conveyed to David, and there was no delusion in it. "He will not turn from it." Jehovah is not a changeable being. He never turns from his purpose, much less from his promise solemnly ratified by oath. He turneth never lie is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent. What a rock they stand upon who have an immutable oath of God for their foundation! We know that this covenant was really made with Christ, the spiritual seed of David, for Peter quotes it at Pentecost, saying, "Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ." Christ therefore sits on a sure throne for ever and ever, seeing that he has kept the covenant, and through him the blessing comes upon Zion, whose poor are blessed in him. "Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne." Jesus sprang from the race of David, as the evangelists are careful to record; he was "of the house and lineage of David": at this day he is the King of the Jews, and the Lord has also given him the heathen for his inheritance. He must reign, and of his kingdom there shall be no end. God himself has set him on the throne and no rebellion of men or devils can shake his dominion. The honour of Jehovah is concerned in his reign, and therefore it is never in danger; for the Lord will not suffer his oath to be dishonoured.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-12.htm">Psalm 132:12</a><p>"If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them." There is a condition to the covenant so far as it concerned kings of David's line before the coming of the true Seed; but he has fulfilled that condition, and made the covenant indefeasible henceforth and for ever as to himself and the spiritual seed in him. Considered as it related to temporal things it was no small blessing for David's dynasty to be secured the throne upon good behaviour. These monarchs held their crowns from God upon the terms of loyalty to their superior Sovereign, the Lord who had elevated them to their high position. They were to be faithful to the covenant by obedience to the divine law, and by belief of divine truth. They were to accept Jehovah as their Lord and their Teacher, regarding him in both relations as in covenant with him. What a condescension on God's part to be their teacher! How gladly ought they to render intelligent obedience! What a proper, righteous, and needful stipulation for God to make that they should be true to him when the reward was the promise, "Their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore." If they will sit at his feet God will make them sit on a throne; if they will keep the covenant they shall keep the crown from generation to generation.<p>The kingdom of Judah might have stood to this day had its kings been faithful to the Lord. No internal revolt or external attack could have overthrown the royal house of David: it fell by its own sin, and by nothing else. The Lord was continually provoked, but he was amazingly long-suffering, for long after seceding Israel had gone into captivity, Judah still remained. Miracles of mercy were shown to her. Divine patience exceeded all limits, for the Lord's regard for David was exceeding great. The princes of David's house seemed set on ruining themselves, and nothing could save them; justice waited long, but it was bound at last to unsheathe the sword and strike. Still, if in the letter man's breach of promise caused the covenant to fail, yet in spirit and essence the Lord has been true to it, for Jesus reigns, and holds the throne for ever. David's seed is still royal, for he was the progenitor according to the flesh of him who is King of kings and Lord of lords.<p>This verse shows us the need of family piety. Parents must see to it that their children know the fear of the Lord, and they must beg the Lord himself to teach them his truth. We have no hereditary right to the divine favour: the Lord keeps up his friendship to families from generation to generation, for he is loth to leave the descendants of his servants, and never does so except under grievous and long-continued provocation. As believers we are all in a measure under some such covenant as that of David, certain of us can look backward for four generations of saintly ancestors, and we are now glad to look forward to see our children, and our children's children, walking in the truth. Yet we know that grace does not run in the blood, and we are filled with holy fear lest in any of our seed there should be an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.<p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Sworn in truth; </span> not falsely or deceitfully, as men sometimes do, but sincerely and faithfully, what he will inviolably observe and fulfil, as the next clause expounds this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the fruit of thy body; </span> some of thy posterity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/132.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David,.... By Nathan the prophet; when he assured him that his house, kingdom, and throne, should be established for ever, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>; and though there is no mention made of the oath of God, no doubt there was one; or however his word was his oath, as Kimchi observes: besides, the Apostle Peter is express for it that there was one, which was added to his word for the confirmation of it; who is said to swear by himself, because there is no greater; and sometimes by one or other of his perfections, as by his holiness elsewhere; so here in or by his truth, his faithfulness, being the God of truth that cannot lie. Or it may be rendered, "the Lord hath sworn truth unto David" (x); that which is truth: and we may be assured he could not possibly assert or swear anything else; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3</a>; <p>he will not turn from it; change his mind, repent of his oath; make it void, or not fulfil it; for he is unchangeable in his perfections, purposes, and promises; whatever he says and swears to he will certainly perform; <p>of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne; a king upon thy throne, as the Targum: meaning not Solomon; though it is true that the Lord chose him, above all the sons of David, to be his successor in the kingdom, and did place him upon his throne before his death; but a greater than Solomon is here, even the Messiah; as is clear from the testimony of the Apostle Peter, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>, by which it appears not only that this promise and oath relate to the Messiah; but that David knew they did, and so understood them; and which have been fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth: who, as he was notoriously the fruit of David's body according to the flesh, or his human nature; or was of his seed, being born of the Virgin Mary, who lineally descended from him; so he was set upon the throne of David, as it was foretold both by the prophet Isaiah, and by the angel to the virgin, he should, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>; not in a literal sense; for though he was no doubt right heir to the throne of David so understood, yet his kingdom was not of this world; but he was set as King over God's holy hill of Zion, the church; and reigned over the house of Jacob, the whole Israel of God; the mystical and spiritual Israel, consisting of Jews and Gentiles: his throne, or the seat of his kingdom, is the church; his sceptre the Gospel; his crown the glory true believers in him give him; his laws, by which he rules, are its his word, and written in the hearts of his subjects; and his kingdom shall continue for ever. <p>(x) "juravit veritatem", V.

This passage is based mainly on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>, but contains likewise expressions which seem taken from other psalms, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-16.htm">Psalm 68:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-14.htm">Psalm 147:14</a>.

It is the post-Davidic church which here reminds Jahve of the hereinafter mentioned promises (of the "mercies of David," <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>) with which He has responded to David's &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. By this verbal substantive of the Pual is meant all the care and trouble which David had in order to procure a worthy abode for the sanctuary of Jahve. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489; signifies to trouble or harass one's self about anything, afflictari (as frequently in the Book of Ecclesiastes); the Pual here denotes the self-imposed trouble, or even that imposed by outward circumsntaces, such as the tedious wars, of long, unsuccessful, and yet never relaxed endeavours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>). For he had vowed unto God that he would give himself absolutely no rest until he had obtained a fixed abode for Jahve. What he said to Nathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>) is an indication of this vowed resolve, which was now in a time of triumphant peace, as it seemed, ready for being carried out, after the first step towards it had already been taken in the removal of the Ark of the covenant to Zion (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>); for <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> is appended to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a> out of its chronological order and only on account of the internal connection. After the bringing home of the Ark, which had been long yearned for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-2.htm">Psalm 101:2</a>), and did not take place without difficulties and terrors, was accomplished, a series of years again passed over, during which David always carried about with him the thought of erecting God a Temple-building. And when he had received the tidings through Nathan that he should not build God a house, but that it should be done by his son and successor, he nevertheless did as much towards the carrying out of the desire of his heart as was possible in connection with this declaration of the will of Jahve. He consecrated the site of the future Temple, he procured the necessary means and materials for the building of it, he made all the necessary arrangements for the future Temple-service, he inspirited the people for the gigantic work of building that was before them, and handed over to his son the model for it, as it is all related to us in detail by the chronicler. The divine name "the mighty One of Jacob" is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>. The Philistines with their Dagon had been made to feel this mighty Rock of Jacob when they took the sacred Ark along with them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-12</a>). With &#1488;&#1501; David solemnly declares what he is resolved not to do. The meaning of the hyperbolically expressed vow in the form of an oath is that for so long he will not rejoice at his own dwelling-house, nor give himself up to sleep that is free from anxiety; in fine, for so long he will not rest. The genitives after &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; are appositional genitives; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a> delights in similar combinations of synonyms. &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; (Latin strata mea) is a poetical plural, as also is &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;. With &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (which is always said of the eyelids, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>, not of the eyes) alternates &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514; (according to another reading &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;) for &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;.

This Aramaizing rejection of the syllable before the tone is, however, without example elsewhere.
