When work is to be done for the Lord, it is good to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/132.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How he sware unto the Lord - The solemn oath which he took that he would make this the first object; that he would give himself no rest until this was done; that he would sacrifice his personal ease and comfort in order that he might thus honor God. This oath or purpose is not recorded in the history. The fair interpretation of this would be either<p>(1) that these words properly expressed what was in the mind of David at the time - that is, his acts implied that this purpose was in his heart; or<p>(2) that this vow was actually made by David, though not elsewhere recorded. Such a vow might have been made, and the remembrance of it kept up by tradition, or it might have been suggested to the author of the psalm by direct inspiration.<p>And vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>. The God whom Jacob worshipped, and who had manifested himself so signally to him as a God of might or power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/132.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 132<p>Ps 132:1-18. The writer, perhaps Solomon (compare Ps 132:8, 9), after relating David's pious zeal for God's service, pleads for the fulfilment of the promise (2Sa 7:16), which, providing for a perpetuation of David's kingdom, involved that of God's right worship and the establishment of the greater and spiritual kingdom of David's greater Son. Of Him and His kingdom both the temple and its worship, and the kings and kingdom of Judah, were types. The congruity of such a topic with the tenor of this series of Psalms is obvious.<p>1-5. This vow is not elsewhere recorded. It expresses, in strong language, David's intense desire to see the establishment of God's worship as well as of His kingdom.<p>remember David&#8212;literally, "remember for David," that is, all his troubles and anxieties on the matter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/132.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He made a solemn vow, and confirmed it with an oath; which he undoubtedly did, although no mention be made of it <span class="bld">2 Samuel 7</span>.

He hopes in Jahve (acc. obj. as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-21.htm">Psalm 25:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>), his soul hopes; hoping in and waiting upon God is the mood of his inmost and of his whole being. He waits upon God's word, the word of His salvation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-81.htm">Psalm 119:81</a>), which, if it penetrates into the soul and cleaves there, calms all unrest, and by the appropriated consolation of forgiveness transforms and enlightens for it everything in it and outside of it. His soul is &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, i.e., stedfastly and continually directed towards Him; as Chr. A. Crusius when on his death-bed, with hands and eyes uplifted to heaven, joyfully exclaimed: "My soul is full of the mercy of Jesus Christ. My whole soul is towards God." The meaning of &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; becomes at once clear in itself from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/143-6.htm">Psalm 143:6</a>, and is defined moreover, without supplying &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; (Hitzig), according to the following &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;. Towards the Lord he is expectantly turned, like those who in the night-time wait for the morning. The repetition of the expression "those who watch for the morning" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11</a>) gives the impression of protracted, painful waiting. The wrath, in the sphere of which the poet now finds himself, is a nightly darkness, out of which he wishes to be removed into the sunny realm of love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>); not he alone, however, but at the same time all Israel, whose need is the same, and for whom therefore believing waiting is likewise the way to salvation. With Jahve, and with Him exclusively, with Him, however, also in all its fulness, is &#1492;&#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (contrary to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/62-13.htm">Psalm 62:13</a>, without any pausal change in accordance with the varying of the segolates), the mercy, which removes the guilt of sin and its consequences, and puts freedom, peace, and joy into the heart. And plenteous (&#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, an adverbial infin. absol., used here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a>, as an adjective) is with Him redemption; i.e., He possesses in the richest measure the willingness, the power, and the wisdom, which are needed to procure redemption, which rises up as a wall of partition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>) between destruction and those imperilled. To Him, therefore, must the individual, if he will obtain mercy, to Him must His people, look up hopingly; and this hope directed to Him shall not be put to shame: He, in the fulness of the might of His free grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>), will redeem Israel from all its iniquities, by forgiving them and removing their unhappy inward and outward consequences. With this promise (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-22.htm">Psalm 25:22</a>) the poet comforts himself. He means complete and final redemption, above all, in the genuinely New Testament manner, spiritual redemption. </body></html>
