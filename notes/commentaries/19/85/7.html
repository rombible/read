The favour of God is the fountain of happiness to nations, as well as to particular persons. When God forgives sin, he covers it; and when he covers the sin of his people, he covers it all. See what the pardon of sin is. In compassion to us, when Christ our Intercessor has stood before thee, thou hast turned away thine anger. When we are reconciled to God, then, and not till then, we may expect the comfort of his being reconciled to us. He shows mercy to those to whom he grants salvation; for salvation is of mere mercy. The Lord's people may expect sharp and tedious afflictions when they commit sin; but when they return to him with humble prayer, he will make them again to rejoice in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/85.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shew us thy mercy, O Lord - That is, Manifest thy mercy in returning to us; in forgiving our sins; in taking from us the tokens of thy displeasure.<p>And grant us thy salvation - Salvation or deliverance from our present trouble and calamities. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/85.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. draw out&#8212;or, "prolong" (Ps 36:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/85.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Show us thy mercy, </span> i.e. grant it to us, as the next words explain it, and as showing signifies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm" title="There be many that say, Who will show us any good?
