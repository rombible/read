The favour of God is the fountain of happiness to nations, as well as to particular persons. When God forgives sin, he covers it; and when he covers the sin of his people, he covers it all. See what the pardon of sin is. In compassion to us, when Christ our Intercessor has stood before thee, thou hast turned away thine anger. When we are reconciled to God, then, and not till then, we may expect the comfort of his being reconciled to us. He shows mercy to those to whom he grants salvation; for salvation is of mere mercy. The Lord's people may expect sharp and tedious afflictions when they commit sin; but when they return to him with humble prayer, he will make them again to rejoice in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/85.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lord, thou hast been favorable unto thy land - Margin, "well pleased with." The idea is that he had been kind or propitious to the nation; to wit, on some former occasion. So Luther, (vormals) "formerly." The reference is to some previous period in their history, when he had exercised his power in their behalf.<p>Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob - That is, at the time referred to. It is not necessary to suppose that the allusion is to the period immediately preceding the time when the psalm was composed, but it may have been any period in their history. Nor is it necessary to suppose that the people had been removed from their land at the time, for all that would be necessary to suppose in interpreting the language would be that the land had been invaded, even though the inhabitants still remained in it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/85.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>PSALM 85<p>Ps 85:1-13.

The self-existent, all-sufficient Jehovah is addressed: by that name he revealed himself to Moses when his people were in bondage, by that name he is here pleaded with. It is wise to dwell upon that view of the divine character which arouses the sweetest memories of his love. Sweeter still is that dear name of "Our Father," with which Christians have learned to commence their prayers. The Psalmist speaks of Canaan as the Lord's land, for he chose it for his people, conveyed it to them by covenant, conquered it by his power, and dwelt in it in mercy; it was meet therefore that he should smile upon a land so peculiarly his own. It is most wise to plead the Lord's union of interest with ourselves, to lash our little boat as it were close to his great barque, and experience a sacred community in the tossings of the storm. It is our land that is devastated, but O Jehovah, it is also thy land. The Psalmist dwells upon the Lord's favour to the chosen land, which he had shewed in a thousand ways. God's past doings are prophetic of what he will do: hence the encouraging argument - "Thou hast been favourable unto thy land," therefore deal graciously with it again. Many a time had foes been baffled, pestilence stayed, famine averted, and deliverance vouchsafed, because of the Lord's favour; that same favourable regard is therefore again invoked. With an immutable God this is powerful reasoning; it is because he changes not that we are not consumed, and know We never shall be if he has once been favourable to us. From this example of prayer let us learn how to order our cause before God.<p>It is clear that Israel was not in exile, or the prayer before us would not have referred to the land but to the nation.<p>"Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob." When down-trodden and oppressed through their sins, the Ever-merciful One had looked upon them, changed their sad condition, chased away the invaders, and given to his people rest: this he had done not once, nor twice, but times without number. Many a time have we also been brought into Soul-captivity by our backslidings, but we have not been left therein; the God who brought Jacob back from Padan-aram to his father's house, has restored us to the enjoyment of holy fellowship; - will he not do the like again? Let us appeal to him with Jacob-like wrestlings, beseeching him to be favourable, or sovereignly gracious to us notwithstanding all our provocations of his love. Let declining churches remember their former history, and with holy confidence plead with the Lord to turn their captivity yet again.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-2.htm">Psalm 85:2</a><p>"Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people." Often and often had he done this, pausing to pardon even when his sword was bared to punish. Who is a pardoning God like thee, O Jehovah? Who is so slow to anger, so ready to forgive? Every believer in Jesus enjoys the blessing of pardoned sin, and he should regard this priceless boon as the pledge of all other needed mercies, He should plead it with God - "Lord hast thou pardoned me, and wilt thou let me perish for lack of grace, or fall into thine enemies' hands for want of help. Thou wilt not thus leave thy work unfinished." "Thou hast covered all their sin," All of it, every spot, and wrinkle, the veil of love has covered all. Sin has been divinely put out of sight. Hiding it beneath the propitiatory; covering it with the sea of the atonement, blotting it out, making it to cease to be, the Lord has put it so completely away that even his omniscient eye sees it no more. What a miracle is this! To cover up the sun would be easy work compared with the covering up of sin. Not without a covering atonement is sin removed, but by means of the great sacrifice of our Lord Jesus, it is most effectually put away by one act, for ever. What a covering does his blood afford!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-3.htm">Psalm 85:3</a><p>"Thou hast taken away all thy wrath." Having removed the sin, the anger is removed also. How often did the long-suffering of God take away from Israel the punishments which had been justly laid upon them! How often also has the Lord's chastising hand been removed from Us when our waywardness called for heavier strokes! "Thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger," Even when judgments had been most severe, the Lord had in mercy stayed his hand. In mid volley he had restrained his thunder. When ready to destroy, he had averted his face from his purpose of judgment and allowed mercy to interpose. The book of Judges is full of illustrations of this, and the Psalmist does well to quote them while he intercedes. Is not our experience equally studded with instances in which judgment has been stayed and tenderness has ruled? What a difference between the fierce anger which is feared and deprecated here, and the speaking of peace which is foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-8.htm">Psalm 85:8</a>. There are many changes in Christian experience, and therefore we must not despair when we are undergoing the drearier portion of the spiritual life, for soon, very soon, it may be transformed into gladness.<p>"The Lord can clear the darkest skies,<p>Can give us day for night,<p>continued...<span class="bld">THE ARGUMENT</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Psalm is thought to have been made after the people’s return from the Babylonish captivity, wherein he partly gives God thanks for that glorious deliverance, and partly implores God’s mercy in completing that work, and rescuing his people from the relics of their bondage, and from the vexation which they had by their neighbours after they were returned to Canaan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The psalmist, out of the experience of former mercies, prayeth for the continuance of them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/85-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been favorable to your land: you have brought back the captivity of Jacob....">Psalm 85:1-7</a></span>; resolveth to wait on the Lord: and hear what he will speak, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-8.htm" title="I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace to his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.">Psalm 85:8</a></span>.

The land of Canaan, which the Lord chose for the people of Israel, and put them into the possession of it; and where he himself chose to dwell, and had a sanctuary built for him; and therefore though the whole earth is his, yet this was his land and inheritance in a peculiar manner, as it is called, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>, the inhabitants of it are meant, to whom the Lord was favourable, or whom he graciously accepted, and was well pleased with and delighted in, as appears by his choosing them above all people to be his people; by bringing them out of Egyptian bondage, by leading them through the Red sea and wilderness, by feeding and protecting them there; and by bringing them into the land of Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey, and settling them in it; and by many temporal blessings, and also spiritual ones, as his word and ordinances; but especially by sending his own Son, the Messiah and Saviour, unto them; and which perhaps is what is here principally intended: <p>thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob; or, "the captives" (m) of Jacob; in a temporal sense, both out of Egypt, and out of Babylon; and in a spiritual sense from sin, Satan, and the law; the special people of God often go by the name of Jacob, and these are captives to the above mentioned; and redemption by Christ is a deliverance of them from their captivity, or a bringing of it back, for he has led captivity captive; and in consequence of this they are put into a state of freedom, liberty is proclaimed to these captives, and they are delivered, and all as the fruit and effect of divine favour. <p>(m) "captivam turbam", Junius &amp; Tremellius; i. e.

Many hindrances must be cleared away if the poet is to get back to Zion, his true home; but his longing carries the surety within itself of its fulfilment: blessed, yea in himself blessed, is the man, who has his strength (&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; only here plene) in God, so that, consequently, the strength of Him to whom all things are possible is mighty in his weakness. What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-6.htm">Psalm 84:6</a> is less adapted to be the object of the being called blessed than the result of that blessed relationship to God. What follows shows that the "high-roads" are not to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>., or any other passage, as an ethical, notional figure (Venema, Hengstenberg, Hitzig, and others), but according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21</a>), with Aben-Ezra, Vatablus, and the majority of expositors, of the roads leading towards Zion; not, however, as referring to the return from the Exile, but to the going up to a festival: the pilgrim-high-roads with their separate halting-places (stations) were constantly present to the mind of such persons. And though they may be driven never so far away from them, they will nevertheless reach the goal of their longing. The most gloomy present becomes bright to them: passing through even a terrible wilderness, they turn it (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;) into a place of springs, their joyous hope and the infinite beauty of the goal, which is worth any amount of toil and trouble, afford them enlivening comfort, refreshing strengthening in the midst of the arid steppe. &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488; does not signify the "Valley of weeping," as Hupfeld at last renders it (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), although Burckhardt found a [Arab.] wa&#770;d&#305;&#770; 'l-bk' (Valley of weeping) in the neighbourhood of Sinai. In Hebrew "weeping" is &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;, Rnan, in the fourth chapter of his Vie de Jsus, understands the expression to mean the last station of those who journey from northern Palestine on this side of the Jordan towards Jerusalem, viz., Ain el-Haram&#305;&#770;je, in a narrow and gloomy valley where a black stream of water flows out of the rocks in which graves are dug, so that consequently &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; &#1492;&#1499;&#1499;&#1488; signifies Valley of tears or of trickling waters. But such trickling out of the rock is also called &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm">Job 28:11</a>, and not &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;. This latter is the singular to &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-24.htm">2 Samuel 5:24</a> (cf. &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>), the name of a tree, and, according to the old Jewish lexicographers, of the mulberry-tree (Talmudic &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, Arab. tu&#770;t); but according to the designation, of a tree from which some kind of fluid flows, and such a tree is the Arab. baka'un, resembling the balsam-tree, which is very common in the arid valley of Mecca, and therefore might also have given its name to some arid valley of the Holy Land (vid., Winer's Realwrterbuch, s.v. Bacha), and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-22.htm">2 Samuel 5:22-25</a>, to one belonging, as it would appear, to the line of valley which leads from the coasts of the Philistines to Jerusalem. What is spoken of in passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>, as being wrought by the omnipotence of God, who brings His people home to Zion, appears here as the result of the power of faith in those who, keeping the same end of their journeyings in view, pass through the unfruitful sterile valley. That other side, however, also does not remain unexpressed. Not only does their faith bring forth water out of the sand and rock of the desert, but God also on His part lovingly anticipates their love, and rewardingly anticipates their faithfulness: a gentle rain, like that which refreshes the sown fields in the autumn, descends from above and enwraps it (viz., the Valley of Baca) in a fulness of blessing (&#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, Hiphil with two accusatives, of which one is to be supplied: cf. on the figure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-14.htm">Psalm 65:14</a>). The arid steppe becomes resplendent with a flowery festive garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>.), not to outward appearance, but to them spiritually, in a manner none the less true and real. And whereas under ordinary circumstances the strength of the traveller diminishes in proportion as he has traversed more and more of his toilsome road, with them it is the very reverse; they go from strength to strength (cf. on the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a>), i.e., they receive strength for strength (cf. on the subject-matter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>), and that an ever increasing strength, the nearer they come to the desired goal, which also they cannot fail to reach. The pilgrim-band (this is the subject to &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;), going on from strength to (&#1488;&#1500;) strength, at last reaches, attains to (&#1488;&#1500; instead of the &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; used in other instances) Elohim in Zion. Having reached this final goal, the pilgrim-band pours forth its heart in the language of prayer such as we have in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/84-9.htm">Psalm 84:9</a>, and the music here strikes up and blends its sympathetic tones with this converse of the church with its God.<p>The poet, however, who in spirit accompanies them on their pilgrimage, is now all the more painfully conscious of being at the present time far removed from this goal, and in the next strophe prays for relief. He calls God &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>), for without His protection David's cause is lost. May He then behold (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, used just as absolutely as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">2 Chronicles 24:22</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-50.htm">Lamentations 3:50</a>), and look upon the face of His anointed, which looks up to Him out of the depth of its reproach. The position of the words shows that &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be regarded as the object to &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-10.htm">Psalm 47:10</a>) and in opposition to the accentuation, for why should it not then have been &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;? The confirmation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>) puts the fact that we have before us a Psalm belonging to the time of David's persecution by Absalom beyond all doubt. Manifestly, when his king prevails, the poet will at the same time (cf. David's language, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>) be restored to the sanctuary. A single day of his life in the courts of God is accounted by him as better than a thousand other days (&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507; with Olewejored and preceded by Rebia parvum). He would rather lie down on the threshold (concerning the significance of this &#1492;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1508;&#1507; in the mouth of a Korahite, vid., supra, p. 311) in the house of his God than dwell within in the tents of ungodliness (not "palaces," as one might have expected, if the house of God had at that time been a palace). For how worthless is the pleasure and concealment to be had there, when compared with the salvation and protection which Jahve Elohim affords to His saints! This is the only instance in which God is directly called a sun (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;) in the sacred writings (cf. Sir. 42:16). He is called a shield as protecting those who flee to Him and rendering them inaccessible to their foes, and a sun as the Being who dwells in an unapproachable light, which, going forth from Him in love towards men, is particularized as &#1495;&#1503; and &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, as the gentle and overpowering light of the grace and glory (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; and &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;) of the Father of Lights. The highest good is self-communicative (communicativum sui). The God of salvation does not refuse any good thing to those who walk &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6</a>; cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>). Upon all receptive ones, i.e., all those who are desirous and capable of receiving His blessings, He freely bestows them out of the abundance of His good things. Strophe and anti-strophe are doubled in this second half of the song. The epode closely resembles that which follows the first half. And this closing ashre&#770; is not followed by any Sela. The music is hushed. The song dies away with an iambic cadence into a waiting expectant stillness. </body></html>
