The favour of God is the fountain of happiness to nations, as well as to particular persons. When God forgives sin, he covers it; and when he covers the sin of his people, he covers it all. See what the pardon of sin is. In compassion to us, when Christ our Intercessor has stood before thee, thou hast turned away thine anger. When we are reconciled to God, then, and not till then, we may expect the comfort of his being reconciled to us. He shows mercy to those to whom he grants salvation; for salvation is of mere mercy. The Lord's people may expect sharp and tedious afflictions when they commit sin; but when they return to him with humble prayer, he will make them again to rejoice in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/85.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? - Thine anger is so long continued that it seems as if it would never cease.<p>Wilt thou draw out thine anger - Wilt thou protract or prolong it? The idea is that of a determined purpose, in retaining his anger, as if his wrath would cease of necessity unless there were such a direct exercise of will.<p>To all generations - literally, "from generation to generation." That is, - so that not merely the generation which has sinned, and which has brought down these tokens of displeasure, shall suffer, but the next, and the next, and the next, forever. The plea is that the judgment might terminate, and not reach coming generations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/85.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. draw out&#8212;or, "prolong" (Ps 36:10).<a name="tod" id="tod"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/tod/psalms/85.htm">The Treasury of David</a></div>5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?<p>6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?<p>7 Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-5.htm">Psalm 85:5</a><p>"Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?" See how the Psalmist makes bold to plead. We are in time as yet and not in eternity, and does not time come to an end, and therefore thy wrath! Wilt thou be angry always as if it were eternity? Is there no boundary to thine indignation? Will thy wrath never have done? And if for ever angry, yet wilt thou be angry "with us," thy favoured people, the seed of Abraham, thy friend? That our enemies should be always wroth is natural but wilt thou, our God, be always incensed against us? Every word is an argument. Men in distress never waste words. "Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?" Shall sons suffer for their fathers' faults, and punishment become an entailed inheritance? O merciful God, hast thou a mind to spin out thine anger, and make it as long as the ages? Cease thou, as thou hast ceased aforetime, and let grace reign as it has done in days of yore. When we are under spiritual desertion we may beg in the like manner that the days of tribulation may be shortened, lest our spirit should utterly fail beneath the trial.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-6.htm">Psalm 85:6</a><p>"Will thou not revive us again?" Hope here grows almost confident. She feels sure that the Lord will return in all his power to save. We are dead or dying, faint and feeble, God alone can revive us, he has in other times refreshed his people, he is still the same, he will repeat his love. Will he not? Why should he not? We appeal to him - "Wilt thou not?" "That thy people may rejoice in thee." Thou lovest to see thy children happy with that best of happiness which centres in thyself, therefore revive us, for revival will bring us the utmost joy. The words before us teach us that gratitude has an eye to the giver, even beyond the gift - "thy people may rejoice in thee." Those who were revived would rejoice not only in the new life but in the Lord who was the author of it. Joy in the Lord is the ripest fruit of grace, all revivals and renewals lead up to it. By our possession of it we may estimate our spiritual condition, it is a sure gauge of inward prosperity. A genuine revival without joy in the Lord is as impossible as spring without flowers, or daydawn without light. If, either in our own souls or in the hearts of others, we see declension, it becomes us to be much in the use of this prayer, and if on the other hand we are enjoying visitations of the Spirit and bedewings of grace, let us abound in holy joy and make it our constant delight to joy in God.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-7.htm">Psalm 85:7</a><p>"Shew us thy mercy, O Lord." Reveal it to our poor half-blinded eyes. We cannot see it or believe it by reason of our long woes, but thou canst make it plain to us. Others have beheld it, Lord shew it to us. We have seen thine anger, Lord let us see thy mercy. Thy prophets have told us of it, but, O Lord, do thou thyself display it in this our hour of need. "And grant us thy salvation." This includes deliverance from the sin as well as the chastisement, it reaches from the depth of their misery to the height of divine love. God's salvation is perfect in kind, comprehensive in extent, and eminent in degree; grant us this, O Lord, and we have all. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/85.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/85.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?.... God is angry with the wicked every day, their life being a continued series of sin, without repentance for it, or confession of it; and he will be so for ever, of which they will have a constant sense and feeling; and is the worm that never dies, and the fire that is inextinguishable; but he does not retain his anger for ever with his own people; though he is displeased with them, and chastises them for their sins, his anger endures but for a moment; he is pacified towards them and turns away his anger from them, by discovering his pardoning love, and withdrawing his afflicting hand: <p>wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? out of his heart, where it is supposed to be conceived; and out of his treasury, where it is thought to be laid up: this has been drawn out to a great length of time upon the Jewish nation; it has been upon them for almost twenty centuries, or ages, and still remains, and will until the fulness of the Gentiles is brought in; but it will not be drawn out to "all" ages or generations; for they shall return to the Lord, and seek him; and he will come to them, and turn away iniquity from them, and so all Israel shall be saved. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/85.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wilt thou be angry with us <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?</span><p>(d) As in times past they had felt God's mercies, so now being oppressed by the long continuance of evil, they pray to God that according to his nature he would be merciful to them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/85.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

Many hindrances must be cleared away if the poet is to get back to Zion, his true home; but his longing carries the surety within itself of its fulfilment: blessed, yea in himself blessed, is the man, who has his strength (&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; only here plene) in God, so that, consequently, the strength of Him to whom all things are possible is mighty in his weakness. What is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-6.htm">Psalm 84:6</a> is less adapted to be the object of the being called blessed than the result of that blessed relationship to God. What follows shows that the "high-roads" are not to be understood according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>., or any other passage, as an ethical, notional figure (Venema, Hengstenberg, Hitzig, and others), but according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21</a>), with Aben-Ezra, Vatablus, and the majority of expositors, of the roads leading towards Zion; not, however, as referring to the return from the Exile, but to the going up to a festival: the pilgrim-high-roads with their separate halting-places (stations) were constantly present to the mind of such persons. And though they may be driven never so far away from them, they will nevertheless reach the goal of their longing. The most gloomy present becomes bright to them: passing through even a terrible wilderness, they turn it (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;) into a place of springs, their joyous hope and the infinite beauty of the goal, which is worth any amount of toil and trouble, afford them enlivening comfort, refreshing strengthening in the midst of the arid steppe. &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488; does not signify the "Valley of weeping," as Hupfeld at last renders it (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), although Burckhardt found a [Arab.] wa&#770;d&#305;&#770; 'l-bk' (Valley of weeping) in the neighbourhood of Sinai. In Hebrew "weeping" is &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;, Rnan, in the fourth chapter of his Vie de Jsus, understands the expression to mean the last station of those who journey from northern Palestine on this side of the Jordan towards Jerusalem, viz., Ain el-Haram&#305;&#770;je, in a narrow and gloomy valley where a black stream of water flows out of the rocks in which graves are dug, so that consequently &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; &#1492;&#1499;&#1499;&#1488; signifies Valley of tears or of trickling waters. But such trickling out of the rock is also called &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm">Job 28:11</a>, and not &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;. This latter is the singular to &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-24.htm">2 Samuel 5:24</a> (cf. &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>), the name of a tree, and, according to the old Jewish lexicographers, of the mulberry-tree (Talmudic &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, Arab. tu&#770;t); but according to the designation, of a tree from which some kind of fluid flows, and such a tree is the Arab. baka'un, resembling the balsam-tree, which is very common in the arid valley of Mecca, and therefore might also have given its name to some arid valley of the Holy Land (vid., Winer's Realwrterbuch, s.v. Bacha), and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-22.htm">2 Samuel 5:22-25</a>, to one belonging, as it would appear, to the line of valley which leads from the coasts of the Philistines to Jerusalem. What is spoken of in passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>, as being wrought by the omnipotence of God, who brings His people home to Zion, appears here as the result of the power of faith in those who, keeping the same end of their journeyings in view, pass through the unfruitful sterile valley. That other side, however, also does not remain unexpressed. Not only does their faith bring forth water out of the sand and rock of the desert, but God also on His part lovingly anticipates their love, and rewardingly anticipates their faithfulness: a gentle rain, like that which refreshes the sown fields in the autumn, descends from above and enwraps it (viz., the Valley of Baca) in a fulness of blessing (&#1497;&#1506;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, Hiphil with two accusatives, of which one is to be supplied: cf. on the figure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-14.htm">Psalm 65:14</a>). The arid steppe becomes resplendent with a flowery festive garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>.), not to outward appearance, but to them spiritually, in a manner none the less true and real. And whereas under ordinary circumstances the strength of the traveller diminishes in proportion as he has traversed more and more of his toilsome road, with them it is the very reverse; they go from strength to strength (cf. on the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a>), i.e., they receive strength for strength (cf. on the subject-matter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>), and that an ever increasing strength, the nearer they come to the desired goal, which also they cannot fail to reach. The pilgrim-band (this is the subject to &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;), going on from strength to (&#1488;&#1500;) strength, at last reaches, attains to (&#1488;&#1500; instead of the &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; used in other instances) Elohim in Zion. Having reached this final goal, the pilgrim-band pours forth its heart in the language of prayer such as we have in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/84-9.htm">Psalm 84:9</a>, and the music here strikes up and blends its sympathetic tones with this converse of the church with its God.<p>The poet, however, who in spirit accompanies them on their pilgrimage, is now all the more painfully conscious of being at the present time far removed from this goal, and in the next strophe prays for relief. He calls God &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>), for without His protection David's cause is lost. May He then behold (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, used just as absolutely as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">2 Chronicles 24:22</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-50.htm">Lamentations 3:50</a>), and look upon the face of His anointed, which looks up to Him out of the depth of its reproach. The position of the words shows that &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be regarded as the object to &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-10.htm">Psalm 47:10</a>) and in opposition to the accentuation, for why should it not then have been &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;? The confirmation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>) puts the fact that we have before us a Psalm belonging to the time of David's persecution by Absalom beyond all doubt. Manifestly, when his king prevails, the poet will at the same time (cf. David's language, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>) be restored to the sanctuary. A single day of his life in the courts of God is accounted by him as better than a thousand other days (&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507; with Olewejored and preceded by Rebia parvum). He would rather lie down on the threshold (concerning the significance of this &#1492;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1508;&#1507; in the mouth of a Korahite, vid., supra, p. 311) in the house of his God than dwell within in the tents of ungodliness (not "palaces," as one might have expected, if the house of God had at that time been a palace). For how worthless is the pleasure and concealment to be had there, when compared with the salvation and protection which Jahve Elohim affords to His saints! This is the only instance in which God is directly called a sun (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;) in the sacred writings (cf. Sir. 42:16). He is called a shield as protecting those who flee to Him and rendering them inaccessible to their foes, and a sun as the Being who dwells in an unapproachable light, which, going forth from Him in love towards men, is particularized as &#1495;&#1503; and &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, as the gentle and overpowering light of the grace and glory (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; and &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;) of the Father of Lights. The highest good is self-communicative (communicativum sui). The God of salvation does not refuse any good thing to those who walk &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6</a>; cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>). Upon all receptive ones, i.e., all those who are desirous and capable of receiving His blessings, He freely bestows them out of the abundance of His good things. Strophe and anti-strophe are doubled in this second half of the song. The epode closely resembles that which follows the first half. And this closing ashre&#770; is not followed by any Sela. The music is hushed. The song dies away with an iambic cadence into a waiting expectant stillness. </body></html>
