See, in what his hand has accomplished, how secure we are if we put our trust in him.<p>What desolations he hath made in the earth - Or, in the land. The word "desolations" might refer to any "ruin" or "overthrow," which he had brought upon the land of Israel, or on the nations abroad - the destruction of cities, towns, or armies, as proof of his power, and of his ability to save those who put their trust in him. But if this be supposed to refer to the invasion of the land of Israel by Sennacherib, it may point to what occurred to his armies when the angel of the Lord went forth and smote them in their camp <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>, and to the consequent deliverance of Jerusalem from danger. Without impropriety, perhaps, this may be regarded as all appeal to the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go forth and see for themselves how complete was the deliverance; how utter the ruin of their foes; how abundant the proof that God was able to protect his people in times of danger. It adds great beauty to this psalm to suppose that it "was" composed on that occasion, or in view of that invasion, for every part of the psalm may receive a beautiful, and an ample illustration from what occurred at that memorable period. Nothing "could" furnish a clearer proof of the power of God to save, and of the propriety of putting confidence in him in times of national danger, than a survey of the camp of the Assyrians, where an hundred and eighty-five thousand men had been smitten down in one night by the angel of God.

Selah.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-8.htm">Psalm 46:8</a><p>"Come, behold the works of the Lord." The joyful citizens of Jerusalem are invited to go forth and view the remains of their enemies, that they may mark the prowess of Jehovah and the spoil which his right hand hath won for his people. It were well if we also carefully noted the providential dealings of our covenant God, and were quick to perceive his hand in the battles of his church. Whenever we read history it should be with this verse sounding in our ears. We should read the newspaper in the same spirit, to see how the Head of the Church rules the nations for his people's good, as Joseph governed Egypt for the sake of Israel. "What desolations he hath made in the earth." The destroyers he destroys, the desolators he desolates. How forcible is the verse at this date! The ruined cities of Assyria, Babylon, Petra, Bashan, Canaan, are our instructors, and in tables of stone record the doings of the Lord. In every place where his cause and crown have been disregarded ruin has surely followed; sin has been a blight on nations, and left their palaces to lie in heaps. In the days of the writer of this Psalm, there had probably occurred some memorable interposition of God against his Israel's foes; and as he saw their overthrow, he called on his fellow citizens to come forth and attentively consider the terrible things in righteousness which had been wrought on their behalf. Dismantled castles and ruined abbeys in our own land stand as memorials of the Lord's victories over oppression and superstition. May there soon be more of such desolations.<p>"Ye gloomy piles, ye tombs of living men,<p>Ye sepulchres of womanhood, or worse;<p>Ye refuges of lies, soon may ye fall,<p>And 'mid your ruins may the owl, and bat,<p>And dragon find congenial resting place."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a><p>"He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth." His voice quiets the tumult of war, and calls for the silence of peace. However remote and barbarous the tribe, he awes the people into rest. He crushes the great powers till they cannot provoke strife again; he give his people profound repose. "He breaketh the bow," the sender of swift-winged death he renders useless. "And cutteth the spear in sunder" - the lance of the might man he shivers. "He burneth the chariot in the fire" - the proud war-chariot with its death-dealing scythes he commits to the flames. All sorts of weapons he piles heaps on heaps, and utterly destroys them. So was it in Judea in the days of yore, so shall it be in all lands in eras yet to come. Blessed deed of the Prince of Peace! when shall it be literally performed? Already the spiritual foes of his people are despoiled of their power to destroy; but when shall the universal victory of peace be celebrated, and instruments of wholesale murder be consigned to ignominious destruction? How glorious will the ultimate victory of Jesus be in the day of his appearing, when every enemy shall lick the dust!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a><p>continued...<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Among those people of the earth who were neighbouring and vexatious to God’s people, and therefore were cut off by David, and their lands and cities in great part wasted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Come, behold the works of the Lord,.... Of nature and grace, especially those of Providence; both in a way of judgment, as in this verse; and of mercy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>. These words are an address of the psalmist to his friends, as Apollinarius supplies it; or of the church to the fearful among them, who were dismayed at the commotions and disturbances that were in the world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2</a>; and who are encouraged to trust in the Lord, from the consideration of his works, particularly his providential dispensations; <p>what desolations he hath made in the earth; in the land of Judea, at the time of the destruction of the city and temple of Jerusalem, foretold by Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>; by Daniel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>; and by our Lord Jesus Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>; and which desolations being the fulfilling of prophecy, may serve to strengthen the faith of God's people, that whatsoever he has said shall come to pass; and that seeing he made such desolations among the Jews, for their rejection of the Messiah, what may not be expected will be made in the antichristian states, for their opposition to him? and, besides, are a confirmation of the truth of his being come; since after his coming these desolations, according to Daniel, were to be made; nor was the sceptre to depart from Judah till he came, nor the second temple to be destroyed before he was in it. Moreover, these desolations may refer to those that have been made in the Roman empire, upon the blowing of the trumpets; the first "four" of which brought in the Goths, Huns, and Vandals, into the western part of it, which made sad ravages and devastations in it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>; and the "fifth" and "sixth" brought in the Saracens and Turks into the eastern part of it, which seized and demolished it, and made dreadful havoc among men; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>. Likewise the desolations that will be made in the antichristian states may be here intended; when the seven vials of God's wrath will be poured out upon them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1</a> when the kings of the earth will hate the whore, and make her desolate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a>; and all her plagues shall come upon her in one day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>. And a view of these desolations, even in prophecy, may serve to cheer the hearts of God's people under the present reign of antichrist, and under all the rage, fury, and oppression of antichristian powers, since they will all in a little time become desolate. This will be the Lord's doing, and it will be wondrous in our eyes. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/psalms/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Come, behold the works of the LORD, <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> what desolations he hath made in the earth.</span><p>(h) That is, how often he has destroyed his enemies, and delivered his people.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/psalms/46.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Come, behold</span>] The invitation is addressed to all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-13.htm" title="Hear, you that are far off, what I have done; and, you that are near, acknowledge my might.">Isaiah 33:13</a>), but especially to the nations, who are bidden (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-10.htm" title="Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.">Psalm 46:10</a></span>) to take warning from the sight.

The deliverance of Israel from its peril is effected by "desolations" or "devastations," which God accomplishes among the nations. The announcement is very vague and general, so that it would apply to almost any occasion when the people of God were delivered from a pressing peril. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 46:2-4) The congregation begins with a general declaration of that which God is to them. This declaration is the result of their experience. Luther, after the lxx and Vulg., renders it, "in the great distresses which have come upon us." As though &#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; could stand for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, and that this again could mean anything else but "at present existing," to which &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; is not at all appropriate. God Himself is called &#1504;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; as being one who allows Himself to be found in times of distress (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-4.htm">2 Chronicles 15:4</a>, and frequently) exceedingly; i.e., to those who then seek Him He reveals Himself and verifies His word beyond all measure. Because God is such a God to them, the congregation or church does not fear though a still greater distress than that which they have just withstood, should break in upon them: if the earth should change, i.e., effect, enter upon, undergo or suffer a change (an inwardly transitive Hiphil, Ges. &#1431;53, 2); and if the mountains should sink down into the heart (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; exactly as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>) of the sea (ocean), i.e., even if these should sink back again into the waters out of which they appeared on the third day of the creation, so that consequently the old chaos should return. The church supposes the most extreme case, viz., the falling in of the universe which has been creatively set in order. We are no more to regard the language as being allegorical here (as Hengstenberg interprets it, the mountains being  equals  the kingdoms of the world), than we would the language of Horace: si fractus illabatur orbis (Carm. iii. 3, 7). Since &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is not a numerical but amplificative plural, the singular suffixes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a> may the more readily refer back to it. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, pride, self-exaltation, used of the sea as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a> &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a> &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; are used. The futures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a> do not continue the infinitive construction: if the waters thereof roar, foam, etc.; but they are, as their position and repetition indicate, intended to have a concessive sense. And this favours the supposition of Hupfeld and Ewald that the refrain, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-8.htm">Psalm 46:8</a>, 12, which ought to form the apodosis of this concessive clause (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-30.htm">Isaiah 40:30</a>.) has accidentally fallen out here. In the text as it lies before us <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a> attaches itself to &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1504;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;: (we do not fear), let its waters (i.e., the waters of the ocean) rage and foam continually; and, inasmuch as the sea rises high, towering beyond its shores, let the mountains threaten to topple in. The music, which here becomes forte, strengthens the believing confidence of the congregation, despite this wild excitement of the elements. </body></html>
