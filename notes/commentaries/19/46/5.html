We may apply it to spiritual enemies, and the encouragement we have that, through Christ, we shall be conquerors over them. He is a Help, a present Help, a Help found, one whom we have found to be so; a Help at hand, one that is always near; we cannot desire a better, nor shall we ever find the like in any creature. Let those be troubled at the troubling of the waters, who build their confidence on a floating foundation; but let not those be alarmed who are led to the Rock, and there find firm footing. Here is joy to the church, even in sorrowful times. The river alludes to the graces and consolations of the Holy Spirit, which flow through every part of the church, and through God's sacred ordinances, gladdening the heart of every believer. It is promised that the church shall not be moved. If God be in our hearts, by his word dwelling richly in us, we shall be established, we shall be helped; let us trust and not be afraid.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/psalms/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God is in the midst of her - God is in the midst of the "city" referred to above - the "city of God." That is,<p>(a) he dwelt there by the visible symbol of his presence, the Shekinah;<p>(b) he was there "actually" as a help and a protector.<p>It was his chosen abode, and as long as such a Being dwelt in the city, they had nothing to fear.<p>God shall help her - That is, in her danger, he will interpose to save her. This is language such as would be used in reference to a place that was besieged, and would well apply to the state of things when Jerusalem was besieged by the armies of Assyria under Sennacherib. The language expresses the confidence of the people in the time of the impending danger.<p>And that right early - Margin, "when the morning appeareth." Literally, "in the faces of the morning," as the word is commonly used; or, more literally, in the "turning" of the morning - for the verb from which the word is derived means properly "to turn," and then "to turn to or from any one." The noun is applied to the face or countenance, because the person is "turned" to us when we see his countenance. The poetic idea here seems to refer to the day as having turned away "from" us at night, and then as turning about "toward" us in the morning, after having gone, as it were, to the greatest distance from us. "Possibly" there may be an allusion here to what occurred in the camp of the Assyrians, when the discovery that the angel of the Lord had smitten them was made early in the morning, or when men arose in the morning: "The angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose in the morning" (that is, when men arose in the morning), "behold, they were all dead corpses," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/psalms/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. right early&#8212;literally, "at the turn of morning," or change from night to day, a critical time (Ps 30:5; compare Isa 37:36).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/psalms/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Heb. as soon as the morning appeareth, i.e. speedily, after a short night of affliction; compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm" title="For his anger endures but a moment; in his favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.">Psalm 30:5</a></span>; and seasonably, when the danger is greatest, and the enemies prepare to make the assault; which is commonly done in the morning. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/psalms/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>God is in the midst of her,....

The deliverance of Israel from Sennacherib came, it is to be remembered, when it was discovered "early in the morning" that in the camp of the Assyrians were 185,000 "dead corpses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.: 45:17-18) All this has its first and most natural meaning in relation to contemporary history but without being at variance with the reference of the Psalm to the King Messiah, as used by the church. Just as the kings of Judah and of Israel allowed their sons to share in their dominion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-15.htm">1 Kings 20:15</a>), so out of the loving relationship of the daughter of Zion and of the virgins of her train to the King Messiah there spring up children, to whom the regal glory of the house of David which culminates in Him is transferred, - a royal race among which He divides the dominion of the earth (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1-9</a>); for He makes His own people "kings and priests, and they shall reign on the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>). Those children are to be understood here which, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1-7</a>, are born to Him as the dew out of the womb of the morning's dawn - the every-youthful nation, by which He conquers and rules the world. When, therefore, the poet says that he will remember the name of the king throughout all generations, this is based upon the twofold assumption, that he regards himself as a member of an imperishable church (Sir. 37:25), and that he regards the king as a person worthy to be praised by the church of every age. Elsewhere Jahve's praise is called a praise that lives through all generations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-13.htm">Psalm 102:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-13.htm">Psalm 135:13</a>); here the king is the object of the everlasting praise of the church, and, beginning with the church, of the nations also. First of all Israel, whom the psalmist represents, is called upon to declare with praise the name of the Messiah from generation to generation. But it does not rest with Israel alone. The nations are thereby roused up to do the same thing. The end of the covenant history is that Israel and the nations together praise this love-worthy, heroic, and divine King: "His name shall endure for ever; as long as the sun shall His name bud, and all nations shall be blessed in Him (and) shall praise Him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>). </body></html>
