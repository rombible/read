And indeed he seems to have been the first eminent prophet that was raised up, after Moses, to be a public instructer and governor of God’s people. Others there had been before him; but not with so high an authority and public approbation. And therefore St. Peter says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-24.htm" title="Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.">Acts 3:24</a>, <span class="ital">All the prophets from Samuel spake of these days; </span>intimating, that he was the first eminent prophet whom the Lord raised up after Moses. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:19-21 All increase in wisdom and grace, is owing to the presence of God with us. God will graciously repeat his visits to those who receive them aright. Early piety will be the greatest honour of young people. Those who honour God he will honour. Let young people consider the piety of Samuel, and from him they will learn to remember their Creator in the days of their youth. Young children are capable of religion. Samuel is a proof that their waiting upon the Lord will be pleasing to him. He is a pattern of all those amiable tempers, which are the brightest ornament of youth, and a sure source of happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From Dan ... - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-18. he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me&#8212;It is evident that his sleeping chamber was close to that of the aged high priest and that he was accustomed to be called during the night. The three successive calls addressed to the boy convinced Eli of the divine character of the speaker, and he therefore exhorted the child to give a reverential attention to the message. The burden of [the Lord's message] was an extraordinary premonition of the judgments that impended over Eli's house; and the aged priest, having drawn the painful secret from the child, exclaimed, "It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good." Such is the spirit of meek and unmurmuring submission in which we ought to receive the dispensations of God, however severe and afflictive. But, in order to form a right estimate of Eli's language and conduct on this occasion, we must consider the overwhelming accumulation of judgments denounced against his person, his sons, his descendants&#8212;his altar, and nation. With such a threatening prospect before him, his piety and meekness were wonderful. In his personal character he seems to have been a good man, but his sons' conduct was flagrantly bad; and though his misfortunes claim our sympathy, it is impossible to approve or defend the weak and unfaithful course which, in the retributive justice of God, brought these adversities upon him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From Dan even to Beer-sheba; </span> through the whole land, from the northern bound, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dan, </span> to the southern, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Beer-sheba; </span> which was the whole length and largest extent of the land.
