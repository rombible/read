Eli, perceiving that it was the voice of God that Samuel heard, instructed him what to say. Though it was a disgrace to Eli, for God's call to be directed to Samuel, yet he told him how to meet it. Thus the elder should do their utmost to assist and improve the younger that are rising up. Let us never fail to teach those who are coming after us, even such as will soon be preferred before us, Joh 1:30. Good words should be put into children's mouths betimes, by which they may be prepared to learn Divine things, and be trained up to regard them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A personal presence, not a mere voice, or impression upon Samuel's mind, is here distinctly indicated. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-18. he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me&#8212;It is evident that his sleeping chamber was close to that of the aged high priest and that he was accustomed to be called during the night. The three successive calls addressed to the boy convinced Eli of the divine character of the speaker, and he therefore exhorted the child to give a reverential attention to the message. The burden of [the Lord's message] was an extraordinary premonition of the judgments that impended over Eli's house; and the aged priest, having drawn the painful secret from the child, exclaimed, "It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good." Such is the spirit of meek and unmurmuring submission in which we ought to receive the dispensations of God, however severe and afflictive. But, in order to form a right estimate of Eli's language and conduct on this occasion, we must consider the overwhelming accumulation of judgments denounced against his person, his sons, his descendants&#8212;his altar, and nation. With such a threatening prospect before him, his piety and meekness were wonderful. In his personal character he seems to have been a good man, but his sons' conduct was flagrantly bad; and though his misfortunes claim our sympathy, it is impossible to approve or defend the weak and unfaithful course which, in the retributive justice of God, brought these adversities upon him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord came</span>; before, he spake to him at a distance, even from the holy oracle between the cherubims; but now, to prevent all further mistakes, the voice came near to him, as if the person speaking had been present with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And stood</span>; before, the voice passed by him, now the speaker fixeth his abode with him for a time, till he had uttered his whole mind to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As at other times</span>; as he had done before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Samuel, Samuel</span>; his name is here doubled, to engage him to the more speedy and diligent attention. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord came, and stood,.... At the place where Samuel lay; either there was, as Kimchi, a form before his eyes in the vision of prophecy, some visible corporeal shape assumed; or a bright splendour an illustrious appearance of the glory of God; or it may be rather the voice, which before seemed to be at some distance whereabout Eli lay; it now seemed nearer, and was as the voice of one just by him, that sounded in his ears: <p>and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel: repeating his name, in order the more to excite his attention: <p>then Samuel answered, speak, for thy servant heareth; he leaves out the word Lord, which Eli bid him use; for he might be afraid as yet to make mention of the name of the Lord in the vision of prophecy, as Kimchi speaks; or lest it should be the voice of another, as Jarchi; as yet he might not be quite certain whether it was the voice of the Lord, or the voice of a man; for that he should have any mistrust of its being the voice of a demon or spectre, there is no reason to believe. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.

THE MESSAGE TO ELI (vers. 11-18). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The word of the Lord was then issued for the first time to Samuel. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2-4</a> form one period. The clause, "it came to pass at that time" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>), is continued in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>, "that the Lord called," etc. The intervening clauses from &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; to &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; are circumstantial clauses, intended to throw light upon the situation. The clause, "Eli was laid down in his place," etc., may be connected logically with "at that time" by the insertion of "when" (as in the English version: Tr.). The dimness of Eli's eyes is mentioned, to explain Samuel's behaviour, as afterwards described. Under these circumstances, for example, when Samuel heard his own name called out in sleep, he might easily suppose that Eli was calling him to render some assistance. The "lamp of God" is the light of the candlestick in the tabernacle, the seven lamps of which were put up and lighted every evening, and burned through the night till all the oil was consumed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-8.htm">Exodus 30:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>, and the explanation given at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>). The statement that this light was not yet extinguished, is equivalent to "before the morning dawn." "And Samuel was lying (sleeping) in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was." &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; does not mean the holy place, as distinguished from the "most holy," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>,<p>(Note: The Masoretes have taken &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; in this sense, and therefore have placed the Athnach under &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; rednu, to separate &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; from &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, and thus to guard against the conclusion, which might be drawn from this view of &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; that Samuel slept in the holy place.)<p>but the whole tabernacle, the tent with its court, as the palace of the God-king, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>. Samuel neither slept in the holy place by the side of the candlestick and table of shew-bread, nor in the most holy place in front of the ark of the covenant, but in the court, where cells were built for the priests and Levites to live in when serving at the sanctuary (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a>). "The ark of God, i.e., the ark of the covenant, is mentioned as the throne of the divine presence, from which the call to Samuel proceeded.</body></html>
