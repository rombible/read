It was an opportunity given to David to exercise faith and patience. He had a promise of the kingdom, but no command to slay the king. He reasons strongly, both with himself and with his men, against doing Saul any hurt. Sin is a thing which it becomes us to startle at, and to resist temptations thereto. He not only would not do this bad thing himself, but he would not suffer those about him to do it. Thus he rendered good for evil, to him from whom he received evil for good; and was herein an example to all who are called Christians, not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David's heart smote him - He thought the action inconsistent with the respect which he owed to the king. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-7. the men of David said &#8230; Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand&#8212;God had never made any promise of delivering Saul into David's hand; but, from the general and repeated promises of the kingdom to him, they concluded that the king's death was to be effected by taking advantage of some such opportunity as the present. David steadily opposed the urgent instigations of his followers to put an end to his and their troubles by the death of their persecutor (a revengeful heart would have followed their advice, but David rather wished to overcome evil with good, and heap coals of fire upon his head); he, however, cut off a fragment from the skirt of the royal robe. It is easy to imagine how this dialogue could be carried on and David's approach to the king's person could have been effected without arousing suspicion. The bustle and noise of Saul's military men and their beasts, the number of cells or divisions in these immense caverns (and some of them far interior) being enveloped in darkness, while every movement could be seen at the cave's mouth&#8212;the probability that the garment David cut from might have been a loose or upper cloak lying on the ground, and that Saul might have been asleep&#8212;these facts and presumptions will be sufficient to account for the incidents detailed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He said unto his men; </span> either, first, Before he cut off Saul’s lap.
