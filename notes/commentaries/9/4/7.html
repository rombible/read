The two defeats of Israel are termed in this Commentary the Battles of Aphek. The name of Eben-ezer, by which the scene was known in after days, was only given to the locality some twenty years later, on the occasion of the victory of Samuel near the same spot.<p>Philistines and Israelites, then, were equally superstitious in their belief both supposing that Deity was in some way connected with the lifeless gold and wood of the symbol Ark and Cherubim. But the Philistines had some excuse for their fears. Tradition was, no doubt, current among the old inhabitants of Canaan how this sacred Ark had been carried before the conquering armies of Israel in many a battle and siege in those bygone days, when the strange shepherd hordes under Joshua had. first invaded and taken possession of their beautiful land. The next verse explains more clearly some of the reasons for their fear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-7.htm" title="And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp.

Sin, the accursed thing, was in the camp, and gave their enemies all the advantage they could wish for. They own the hand of God in their trouble; but, instead of submitting, they speak angrily, as not aware of any just provocation they had given him. The foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord, Pr 19:3, and finds fault with him. They supposed that they could oblige God to appear for them, by bringing the ark into their camp. Those who have gone back in the life of religion, sometimes discover great fondness for the outward observances of it, as if those would save them; and as if the ark, God's throne, in the camp, would bring them to heaven, though the world and the flesh are on the throne in the heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of the Hebrews - This was the name by which the Israelites were known to foreign nations (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-9. Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us&#8212;Strange that they were so blind to the real cause of the disaster and that they did not discern, in the great and general corruption of religion and morals (1Sa 2:22-25; 7:3; Ps 78:58), the reason why the presence and aid of God were not extended to them. Their first measure for restoring the national spirit and energy ought to have been a complete reformation&#8212;a universal return to purity of worship and morals. But, instead of cherishing a spirit of deep humiliation and sincere repentance, instead of resolving on the abolition of existing abuses, and the re-establishing of the pure faith, they adopted what appeared an easier and speedier course&#8212;they put their trust in ceremonial observances, and doubted not but that the introduction of the ark into the battlefield would ensure their victory. In recommending this extraordinary step, the elders might recollect the confidence it imparted to their ancestors (Nu 10:35; 14:44), as well as what had been done at Jericho. But it is more probable that they were influenced by the heathenish ideas of their idolatrous neighbors, who carried their idol Dagon, or his sacred symbols, to their wars, believing that the power of their divinities was inseparably associated with, or residing in, their images. In short, the shout raised in the Hebrew camp, on the arrival of the ark, indicated very plainly the prevalence among the Israelites at this time of a belief in national deities&#8212;whose influence was local, and whose interest was especially exerted in behalf of the people who adored them. The joy of the Israelites was an emotion springing out of the same superstitious sentiments as the corresponding dismay of their enemies; and to afford them a convincing, though painful proof of their error, was the ulterior object of the discipline to which they were now subjected&#8212;a discipline by which God, while punishing them for their apostasy by allowing the capture of the ark, had another end in view&#8212;that of signally vindicating His supremacy over all the gods of the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God is come, </span> to wit, in and with his ark; or they give the name of God to the ark, before which he was worshipped, as they used to do to the images of their false gods.

The Philistines were ruling over Israel at that time. This is evident, apart from our previous remarks concerning the connection between the commencement of this book and the close of the book of Judges, from the simple fact that the land of Israel was the scene of the war, and that nothing is said about an invasion on the part of the Philistines. The Israelites encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines were encamped at Aphek. The name Ebenezer ("the stone of help") was not given to the place so designated till a later period, when Samuel set up a memorial stone there to commemorate a victory that was gained over the Philistines upon the same chosen battle-field after the lapse of twenty years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>). According to this passage, the stone was set up between Mizpeh and Shen. The former was not the Mizpeh in the lowlands of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>), but the Mizpeh of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>), i.e., according to Robinson, the present Neby Samwil, two hours to the north-west of Jerusalem, and half an hour to the south of Gibeon (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>). The situation of Aphek has not been discovered. It cannot have been far from Mizpeh and Ebenezer, however, and was probably the same place as the Canaanitish capital mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/12-18.htm">Joshua 12:18</a>, and is certainly different from the Aphekah upon the mountains of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>); for this was on the south or south-west of Jerusalem, since, according to the book of Joshua, it belonged to the towns that were situated in the district of Gibeon.</body></html>
