The whole of this account is so vivid, and is so full of detail that it must have come from some eye-witness—probably from Samuel himself. These swift runners are still employed to carry news in war time in the East. In the sacred story we possess several important instances of such messages: for instance, in the account of Absalom’s death, Cushi and Ahimaaz bring the tidings from Joab to King David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/18-21.htm" title="Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran.">2Samuel 18:21-27</a>). Asahel, the son of Zeruiah, the sister of David, is mentioned as being famous for his running (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm" title="And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.">2Samuel 2:18</a>). Elijah, again, we hear, once outran the chariot of Ahab between Carmel and Jezreel. Phidippides, when sent to urge the people of Sparta to come to the help of the Athenians against the Persians, arrived at Sparta on the second day after his departure from Athens (Herodotus, 6:105, 6). Running seems to have been an exercise specially cultivated among the athletes of old times.<p>The rent clothes and the earth upon the head were the usual indications that the news brought by the messenger were tidings of evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm" title="And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth on his head.">1 Samuel 4:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">With his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to the manner of those who bewailed any great calamity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-6.htm" title="And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads.">Joshua 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm" title="And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.">Job 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-30.htm" title="And shall cause their voice to be heard against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust on their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:">Ezekiel 27:30</a>.

According to Jewish tradition, this Benjamite was no other than Saul, but the chronology is at variance with this supposition. The importance in old time, when even roads did not exist, of men capable of running long distances to carry news in war is evident, and many instances are recorded showing the high appreciation in which their services were held Thus the running of the Cushite and of Ahimaaz forms an interesting episode in the pathetic history of Absalom's death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19-31</a>). So Herodotus mentions that Pheidippides, when sent to urge the people of Sparta to come to the help of the Athenians against the Persians, arrived there on the second day after his departure from Athens (Herod., 6:105, 106). Shiloh, apparently, was but a comparatively short distance from Eben-ezer, as the runner arrived there on the evening of the very day on which the battle was fought. The rent clothes and the earth upon the head were the usual signs in token that some great calamity had taken place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the Philistines heard the noise, and learned on inquiry that the ark of Jehovah had come into the camp, they were thrown into alarm, for "they thought (lit. said), God (Elohim) is come into the camp, and said, 'Woe unto us! For such a thing has not happened yesterday and the day before (i.e., never till now). Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the very gods that smote Egypt with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.' " The Philistines spoke of the God of Israel in the plural., &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, as heathen who only knew of gods, and not of one Almighty God. Just as all the heathen feared the might of the gods of other nations in a certain degree, so the Philistines also were alarmed at the might of the God of the Israelites, and that all the more because the report of His deeds in the olden time had reached their ears (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-15</a>). The expression "in the wilderness" does not compel us to refer the words "smote with all the plagues" exclusively to the destruction of Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23</a>.). "All the plagues" include the rest of the plagues which God inflicted upon Egypt, without there being any necessity to supply the copula &#1493; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, as in the lxx and Syriac. By this addition an antithesis is introduced into the words, which, if it really were intended, would require to be indicated by a previous &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1501;. According to the notions of the Philistines, all the wonders of God for the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt took place in the desert, because even when Israel was in Goshen they dwelt on the border of the desert, and were conducted thence to Canaan. </body></html>
