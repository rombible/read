The Chaldee, Arabic, and Syriac here interpret rather than translate, “on the third day thou will be missed the more.” “It did not matter,” writes the Dean, “whether David went fast or slow, as he was to hide there some time, but it was important that David should be far away, so that no prying eye might chance to catch sight of him.”<p><span class= "bld">When the business was in hand.</span>—The expression, <span class= "ital">b’yom hammaăseh, </span>rendered in our version by “when the business was <span class= "ital">in hand,” </span>is one hard to understand. Perhaps the best translation is that adopted by Gesenius, De Wette, and Maurer, who render it quite literally “on the day of the deed,” and understand by “deed” King Saul’s design of killing David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-2.htm" title="But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, I pray you, take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide yourself:">1Samuel 19:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">By the stone Ezel.</span>—This stone, or cairn, or possibly ruin, is mentioned nowhere else. Some have supposed it to have been a road-stone, or stone guide-post. The following ingenious conjecture is hazarded in the <span class= "ital">Speaker’s Commentary:—“</span>The LXX. here, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-41.htm" title="And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.">1Samuel 20:41</a> (where the spot, but not the stone, is spoken of), read <span class= "ital">argab, </span>or <span class= "ital">ergab, </span>a word meaning <span class= "ital">a heap of stones. </span>If this is the true reading, David’s hiding place was either a natural cavernous rock, which was called <span class= "ital">argab, </span>or some ruin of an ancient building equally suited for a hiding place.” Ewald, slightly changing the text, understands the word as signifying “the lonely waste.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-19.htm" title="And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.">1 Samuel 20:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">When thou hast stayed three days, </span>&c. — This is commonly interpreted of his staying so long with his kindred at Bethlehem. In the Hebrew the words are, <span class="ital">Thou shalt three times go down to a very low place; </span>and the meaning seems to be, that if Jonathan did not come to the place appointed the first day, David should take it for granted that he had no information of importance to communicate, and should come again the second day; and if Jonathan brought him no intelligence then, he should come on the third. Houbigant interprets the words, “But on the third day thou shalt come quickly to that place, in which thou shalt hide thyself on the feast-day.” <span class="ital">When the business was in hand — </span>When this same business which they were now treating about was in agitation formerly; namely, to discover Saul’s mind and purpose toward David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/19-2.htm" title="But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, I pray you, take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide yourself:...">1 Samuel 19:2-3</a>. <span class="ital">By the stone Ezel — </span>A stone probably erected to direct travellers in the way: he was to hide himself in some cave or other convenient place near it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:11-23 Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The stone Ezel - It is not mentioned elsewhere, except possibly in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>, where see the note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. when thou hast stayed three days&#8212;either with your family at Beth-lehem, or wherever you find it convenient.<p>come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand&#8212;Hebrew, "in the day," or "time of the business," when the same matter was under inquiry formerly (1Sa 19:22).<p>remain by the stone Ezel&#8212;Hebrew, "the stone of the way"; a sort of milestone which directed travellers.

From court, either at Bethlehem, which seems most probable, or in some other place incognito; however, not in the field he proposed to hide himself in, where he could not continue so long for want of food: <p>then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself; which makes it clear that he did not continue there during that time, but went elsewhere; from whence he was to come in haste at the expiration of three days, to the place he first hid himself in, and which was fixed upon to meet at: <p>when the business was in hand; when the affair was discoursed of, about getting knowledge how Saul was affected to David, and of informing him of it; or "on the day of work" (x); or business, on a working day, as the Septuagint; and so the Targum, on a common day; when, as the Vulgate Latin, it was lawful to work on it; and such was the day when Jonathan and David conversed together about the above affair; it being the day before the new moon, or first day of the month, on which day they used not to work: Some render it, "thou shalt three times go down" (y) to that place; and the sense is, that he should come on the morrow, and if he found not Jonathan there, he might conclude that as yet he knew nothing of his father's mind, and therefore should come the day following that; and if he found him not then, to come on the third day, that so he might be on the spot, let him come on which day he would: <p>and shalt remain by the stone Ezel; which, because it signifies "going", the Jewish commentators generally understand it as a sign to direct travellers which way to go; but one would think this should be an improper place for David to be near, since it must be where two or more ways met, and so a public frequented place; others think therefore it had its name from David and Jonathan often going thither, to discourse with each other; the Septuagint calls it Ergab; and so the place where Jonathan, the son of Saul, exercised himself by shooting darts, is called by Jerom (z); it is said by Josephus (a) to be an hundred fifty furlongs (about nineteen miles), from Jerusalem, and from Jordan sixty, (about eight miles). <p>(x)  "in die operis", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus; "die profesto", Tigurine version.

Jonathan commences with a solemn invocation of God: "Jehovah, God of Israel!" and thus introduces his oath. We have neither to supply "Jehovah is witness," nor "as truly as Jehovah liveth," as some have suggested. "When I inquire of my father about this time to-morrow, the day after to-morrow (a concise mode of saying 'to-morrow or the day after'), and behold it is (stands) well for David, and then I do not send to thee and make it known to thee, Jehovah shall do so to Jonathan," etc. ("The Lord do so," etc., the ordinary formula used in an oath: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>). The other case is then added without an adversative particle: "If it should please my father evil against thee (lit. as regards evil), "I will make it known to thee, and let thee go, that thou mayest go in peace; and Jehovah be with thee, as He has been with my father." In this wish there is expressed the presentiment that David would one day occupy that place in Israel which Saul occupied then, i.e., the throne. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-15.htm">1 Samuel 20:15</a> the Masoretic text gives no appropriate meaning. Luther's rendering, in which he follows the Rabbins and takes the first &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a>) by itself, and then completes the sentence from the context ("but if I do it not, show me no mercy, because I live, not even if I die"), contains indeed a certain permissible sense when considered in itself; but it is hardly reconcilable with what follows, "and do not tear away thy compassion for ever from my house." The request that he would show no compassion to him (Jonathan) even if he died, and yet would not withdraw his compassion from his house for ever, contains an antithesis which would have been expressed most clearly and unambiguously in the words themselves, if this had been really what Jonathan intended to say. De Wette's rendering gives a still more striking contradiction: "But let not (Jehovah be with thee) if I still live, and thou showest not the love of Jehovah to me, that I do not, and thou withdrawest not thy love from my house for ever." There is really no other course open than to follow the Syriac and Arabic, as Maurer, Thenius, and Ewald have done, and change the &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; in the first two clauses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a> into &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, according to the analogy of the form &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-30.htm">1 Samuel 14:30</a>), and to render the passage thus: "And mayest thou, if I still live, mayest thou show to me the favour of the Lord, and not if I do, not withdraw thy favour from my house for ever, not even (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488;) when Jehovah shall cut off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth!" "The favour of Jehovah" is favour such as Jehovah shall cut off," etc., shows very clearly Jonathan's conviction that Jehovah would give to David a victory over all his enemies.</body></html>
