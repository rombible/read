He quotes the excuse in David’s own words.<p>The LXX., instead of “my brother,” has “my brothers.” It thus alters the original, not understanding the singular “brother,” Jesse, their father, being still alive. The brothers collectively might, the LXX. seemed to think, have bidden David to the family sacrificial feast. Dean Payne Smith suggests that as the ceremony was not a private family gathering, but one shared in by the district, the “brother” (probably the eldest), likely enough, was the convener of the absent member of the house of Jesse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/20-29.htm" title="And he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers.

In great peril present opportunities for Divine ordinances may be waved. But it is bad for us, except in case of necessity, to omit any opportunity of statedly attending on them. Jonathan did wisely and well for himself and family, to secure an interest in David, yet for this he is blamed. It is good to take God's people for our people. It will prove to our advantage at last, however it may now be thought against our interest. Saul was outrageous.

And Jonathan having replied that David had asked and obtained his permission to attend a family anniversary at Beth-lehem [Ac 20:28, 29], the pent-up passions of the king burst out in a most violent storm of rage and invective against his son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He hath commanded me to be there; </span> either in his father’s name, or in the right of the first-born; one branch of which was authority over his brethren in all the concerns of the family; whereof this was one. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, let me go, I pray thee, for our family hath a sacrifice in the city,....
