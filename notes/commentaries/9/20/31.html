In great peril present opportunities for Divine ordinances may be waved. But it is bad for us, except in case of necessity, to omit any opportunity of statedly attending on them. Jonathan did wisely and well for himself and family, to secure an interest in David, yet for this he is blamed. It is good to take God's people for our people. It will prove to our advantage at last, however it may now be thought against our interest. Saul was outrageous.

Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman&#8212;This is a striking Oriental form of abuse. Saul was not angry with his wife; it was the son alone, upon whom he meant, by this style of address, to discharge his resentment. The principle on which it is founded seems to be, that to a genuine filial instinct it is a more inexpiable offense to hear the name or character of a parent traduced, than any personal reproach. This was, undoubtedly, one cause of "the fierce anger" in which the high-minded prince left the table without tasting a morsel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thus he grossly mistakes the cause of Jonathan’s loss of the kingdom, which was not David’s art, but Saul’s sin; and vainly endeavours to prevent God’s irrevocable sentence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom,....

"And Jonathan rose up, and Abner seated himself by the side of Saul, and David's place remained empty." The difficult passage, "And Jonathan rose up," etc., can hardly be understood in any other way than as signifying that, when Abner entered, Jonathan rose from his seat by the side of Saul, and gave up the place to Abner, in which case all that is wanting is an account of the place to which Jonathan moved. Every other attempted explanation is exposed to much graver difficulties. The suggestion made by Gesenius, that the cop. &#1493; should be supplied before &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1512;, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; referred to Jonathan ("and Jonathan rose up and sat down, and Abner [sat down] by the side of Saul"), as in the Syriac, is open to this objection, that in addition to the necessity of supplying &#1493;, it is impossible to see why Jonathan should have risen up for the purpose of sitting down again. The rendering "and Jonathan came," which is the one adopted by Maurer and De Wette, cannot be philologically sustained; inasmuch as, although &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is used to signify rise up, in the sense of the occurrence of important events, or the appearance of celebrated of persons, it never means simply "to come." And lastly, the conjecture of Thenius, that &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; should be altered into &#1493;&#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, according to the senseless rendering of the lxx, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, is overthrown by the fact, that whilst &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; does indeed mean to anticipate or come to meet, it never means to sit in front of, i.e., opposite to a person.</body></html>
