Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad&#8212;that is, his missive weapons. The French word artillerie, signifies "archery." The term is still used in England, in the designation of the "artillery company of London," the association of archers, though they have long disused bows and arrows.

And so they parted, David to begin a life of danger and wandering, while Jonathan returned to the city to be a dutiful son to Saul. Phillipson remarks, "The scenes in this chapter are some of the most affecting presented to us in history, whether in old or modern times, and we may Well wonder at the delicacy of feeling and the gentleness of the sentiments which these two men in those old rough times entertained for one another. No ancient writer has set before us so noble an example of a heart felt, unselfish, and thoroughly human state of feeling, and none has described friendship with such entire truth in all its relations, and with such complete and profound knowledge of the human heart." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Jonathan replied, "My father, why shall he die? what has he done?" Saul was so enraged that he hurled his javelin at Jonathan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-11.htm">1 Samuel 18:11</a>). Thus Jonathan saw that his father had firmly resolved to put David to death, and rose up from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat that day; for he was grieved concerning David, because his father had done him shame. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; is a substantive in the sense of unalterable resolution, like the verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-9.htm">1 Samuel 20:9</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, on the second day of the new moon or month. </body></html>
