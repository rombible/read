It was a very simple one, and seems to speak of very early primitive times. Jonathan slightly varies from his original purpose. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm" title="And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not to you, and show it you;">1Samuel 20:12</a> it seems as though he meant to have sent a special messenger had the news been good, but now the arrangement is that in either event he should come himself out from the city into the solitary valley where it was agreed David should remain in hiding by the stone “Ezel.” Dean Payne Smith rather strangely conceives that the arrows of the “sign” were to be aimed at the stone Ezel, but the description points to the “mark” as situated on the side of “Ezel,” in or behind which David was to be concealed.<p>The prince agreed that after the feast he would leave the city, as though about to practise shooting at a mark, and that he would bring with him a servant—probably-one of his young armour-bearers—when, at the spot agreed upon in the neighbourhood of David’s place of concealment near Ezel, he would post his servant in his place as marker, and then would shoot. After shooting, he would call out to his attendant, “the arrows are on this side of thee” (that is, between the mark and Jonathan himself), then David would know all was well; but if he cried “the arrows are beyond thee,” that is, on the further side of the mark, David would understand that all was over, and that he must fly. Jonathan evidently took these precautions not knowing whether or no he would be accompanied by friends of his father from the city, in which case the “sign” agreed upon would be sufficient to tell David what had happened at the feast. As it turned out, Jonathan was able to escape observation, and to go alone with his servant to the place of meeting. He used the sign to attract his friend’s attention, and then followed the last sorrowful parting, told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/20-41.htm" title="And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.">1Samuel 20:41-42</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:11-23 Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he found his father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The stone Ezel - It is not mentioned elsewhere, except possibly in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>, where see the note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. when thou hast stayed three days&#8212;either with your family at Beth-lehem, or wherever you find it convenient.<p>come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand&#8212;Hebrew, "in the day," or "time of the business," when the same matter was under inquiry formerly (1Sa 19:22).<p>remain by the stone Ezel&#8212;Hebrew, "the stone of the way"; a sort of milestone which directed travellers.

Besides, he knew not that he should have any opportunity of private converse with David, by reason of passengers, though the event proved better than he expected. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof,....

No suspicion would be excited by Jonathan’s carrying the bow which was his usual weapon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm" title="And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.">1 Samuel 18:4</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - The two friends now agree upon the sign. Jonathan was to shoot three arrows at this stone, Ezel, as his mark, and was then to send his servant to gather them up. When he bad gone some distance Jonathan was to shout to him, loud enough for David to hear. If Jonathan said that the arrows were on that side the mark, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> between it and Jonathan, David was to come forth boldly, as all was well. But if Jonathan said that the arrows were further on, then David must understand that he was to seek safety in flight. For <span class="cmt_word">there is peace to thee, and no hurt,</span> the Hebrew has "there is peace to thee, and it is nothing," a simpler and more idiomatic rendering. As touching the matter, etc. Rather, "As for the word that we have spoken, I and thou, behold, Jehovah is between me and thee forever." The <span class="accented">word</span> was the bond and covenant by which they had pledged their truth to one another. Though separated, their love was to continue, and Jehovah was to be their eternal centre of union, and the witness to their covenant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the field, where they were both entirely free from observation, Jonathan first of all renewed his covenant with David, by vowing to him on oath that he would give him information of his father's feelings towards him (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>); and then entreated him, with a certain presentiment that David would one day be king, even then to maintain his love towards him and his family for ever (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-16</a>); and lastly, he made David swear again concerning his love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-17.htm">1 Samuel 20:17</a>), and then gave him the sign by which he would communicate the promised information (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-18.htm">1 Samuel 20:18-23</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12-15</a><p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a> are connected. Jonathan commences with a solemn invocation of God: "Jehovah, God of Israel!" and thus introduces his oath. We have neither to supply "Jehovah is witness," nor "as truly as Jehovah liveth," as some have suggested. "When I inquire of my father about this time to-morrow, the day after to-morrow (a concise mode of saying 'to-morrow or the day after'), and behold it is (stands) well for David, and then I do not send to thee and make it known to thee, Jehovah shall do so to Jonathan," etc. ("The Lord do so," etc., the ordinary formula used in an oath: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>). The other case is then added without an adversative particle: "If it should please my father evil against thee (lit. as regards evil), "I will make it known to thee, and let thee go, that thou mayest go in peace; and Jehovah be with thee, as He has been with my father." In this wish there is expressed the presentiment that David would one day occupy that place in Israel which Saul occupied then, i.e., the throne. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-15.htm">1 Samuel 20:15</a> the Masoretic text gives no appropriate meaning. Luther's rendering, in which he follows the Rabbins and takes the first &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a>) by itself, and then completes the sentence from the context ("but if I do it not, show me no mercy, because I live, not even if I die"), contains indeed a certain permissible sense when considered in itself; but it is hardly reconcilable with what follows, "and do not tear away thy compassion for ever from my house." The request that he would show no compassion to him (Jonathan) even if he died, and yet would not withdraw his compassion from his house for ever, contains an antithesis which would have been expressed most clearly and unambiguously in the words themselves, if this had been really what Jonathan intended to say. De Wette's rendering gives a still more striking contradiction: "But let not (Jehovah be with thee) if I still live, and thou showest not the love of Jehovah to me, that I do not, and thou withdrawest not thy love from my house for ever." There is really no other course open than to follow the Syriac and Arabic, as Maurer, Thenius, and Ewald have done, and change the &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; in the first two clauses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a> into &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, according to the analogy of the form &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-30.htm">1 Samuel 14:30</a>), and to render the passage thus: "And mayest thou, if I still live, mayest thou show to me the favour of the Lord, and not if I do, not withdraw thy favour from my house for ever, not even (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488;) when Jehovah shall cut off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth!" "The favour of Jehovah" is favour such as Jehovah shall cut off," etc., shows very clearly Jonathan's conviction that Jehovah would give to David a victory over all his enemies.</body></html>
