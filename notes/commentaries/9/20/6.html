Thus the Lord deals with those whom he prepares unto glory. He does not put them into immediate possession of the kingdom, but leads them to it through much tribulation, which he makes the means of fitting them for it. Let them not murmur at his gracious appointment, nor distrust his care; but let them look forward with joyful expectation to the crown which is laid up for them. Sometimes it appears to us that there is but a step between us and death; at all times it may be so, and we should prepare for the event. But though dangers appear most threatening, we cannot die till the purpose of God concerning us is accomplished; nor till we have served our generation according to his will, if we are believers.

David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat&#8212;The beginning of a new month or moon was always celebrated by special sacrifices, followed by feasting, at which the head of a family expected all its members to be present. David, both as the king's son-in-law and a distinguished courtier, dined on such occasions at the royal table, and from its being generally known that David had returned to Gibeah, his presence in the palace would be naturally expected. This occasion was chosen by the two friends for testing the king's state of feeling. As a suitable pretext for David's absence, it was arranged that he should visit his family at Beth-lehem, and thus create an opportunity of ascertaining how his non-appearance would be viewed. The time and place were fixed for Jonathan reporting to David; but as circumstances might render another interview unsafe, it was deemed expedient to communicate by a concerted signal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Quest.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How could David imagine that Saul would expect his company, whom he had once and again endeavoured to kill? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> First, He might suppose that David would ascribe all that to his madness and frantic fits, which being over, he would promise himself safety in the king’s presence.

It is not clear whether David really wanted to go to Bethlehem, and meant to hide “in the field” afterwards, or whether he regarded the story as a justifiable deception to avoid exciting Saul’s anger.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Saul then set out to Ramah himself, and inquired, as soon as he had arrived at the great pit at Sechu (a place near Ramah with which we are not acquainted), where Samuel and David were, and went, according to the answer he received, to the Naioth at Ramah. There the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying, until he came to the Naioth at Ramah; and there he even took off his clothes, and prophesied before Samuel, and lay there naked all that day, and the whole night as well. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, does not always signify complete nudity, but is also applied to a person with his upper garment off (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>). From the repeated expression "he also," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>, it is not only evident that Saul came into an ecstatic condition of prophesying as well as his servants, but that the prophets themselves, and not merely the servants, took off their clothes like Saul when they prophesied. It is only in the case of &#1506;&#1512;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; that the expression "he also" is not repeated; from which we must infer, that Saul alone lay there the whole day and night with his clothes off, and in an ecstatic state of external unconsciousness; whereas the ecstasy of his servants and the prophets lasted only a short time, and the clear self-consciousness returned earlier than with Saul. This different is not without significance in relation to the true explanation of the whole affair. Saul had experienced a similar influence of the Spirit of God before, namely, immediately after his anointing by Samuel, when he met a company of prophets who were prophesying at Gibeah, and he had been thereby changed into another man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>.). This miraculous seizure by the Spirit of God was repeated again here, when he came near to the seat of the prophets; and it also affected the servants whom he had sent to apprehend David, so that Saul was obliged to relinquish the attempt to seize him. This result, however, we cannot regard as the principal object of the whole occurrence, as Vatablus does when he says, "The spirit of prophecy came into Saul, that David might the more easily escape from his power." Calvin's remarks go much deeper into the meaning: "God," he says, "changed their (the messengers') thoughts and purpose, not only so that they failed to apprehend David according to the royal command, but so that they actually became the companions of the prophets. And God effected this, that the fact itself might show how He holds the hearts of men in His hand and power, and turns and moves them according to His will." Even this, however, does not bring out the full meaning of the miracle, and more especially fails to explain why the same thing should have happened to Saul in an intensified degree. Upon this point Calvin simply observes, that "Saul ought indeed to have been strongly moved by these things, and to have discerned the impossibility of his accomplishing anything by fighting against the Lord; but he was so hardened that he did not perceive the hand of God: for he hastened to Naioth himself, when he found that his servants mocked him;" and in this proceeding on Saul's part he discovers a sign of his increasing hardness of heart. Saul and his messengers, the zealous performers of his will, ought no doubt to have learned, from what happened to them in the presence of the prophets, that God had the hearts of men in His power, and guided them at His will; but they were also to be seized by the might of the Spirit of God, which worked in the prophets, and thus brought to the consciousness, that Saul's raging against David was fighting against Jehovah and His Spirit, and so to be led to give up the evil thoughts of their heart. Saul was seized by this mighty influence of the Spirit of God in a more powerful manner than his servants were, both because he had most obstinately resisted the leadings of divine grace, and also in order that, if it were possible, his hard heart might be broken and subdued by the power of grace. If, however, he should nevertheless continue obstinately in his rebellion against God, he would then fall under the judgment of hardening, which would be speedily followed by his destruction. This new occurrence in Saul's life occasioned a renewal of the proverb: "Is Saul also among the prophets?" The words "wherefore they say" do not imply that the proverb was first used at this time, but only that it received a new exemplification and basis in the new event in Saul's experience. The origin of it has been already mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-12.htm">1 Samuel 10:12</a>, and the meaning of it was there explained.<p>This account is also worthy of note, as having an important bearing upon the so-called Schools of the Prophets in the time of Samuel, to which, however, we have only casual allusions. From the passage before us we learn that there was a company of prophets at Ramah, under the superintendence of Samuel, whose members lived in a common building (&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;), and that Samuel had his own house at Ramah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>), though he sometimes lived in the Naioth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-18.htm">1 Samuel 19:18</a>.). The origin and history of these schools are involved in obscurity. If we bear in mind, that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>, before the call of Samuel as prophet, the prophetic word was very rare in Israel, and prophecy was not widely spread, there can be no doubt that these unions of prophets arose in the time of Samuel, and were called into existence by him. The only uncertainty is whether there were other such unions in different parts of the land beside the one at Ramah. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>, we find a band of prophesying prophets at Gibeah, coming down from the sacrificial height there, and going to meet Saul; but it is not stated there that this company had its seat at Gibeah, although it may be inferred as probable, from the name "Gibeah of God" (see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5-6</a>). No further mention is made of these in the time of Samuel; nor do we meet with them again till the times of Elijah and Elisha, when we find them, under the name of sons of the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>), living in considerable numbers at Gilgal, Bethel, and Jericho (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-7.htm">2 Kings 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-15.htm">2 Kings 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42-43</a>, about a hundred sons of the prophets sat before Elisha at Gilgal, and took their meals together. The number at Jericho may have been quite as great; for fifty men of the sons of the prophets went with Elijah and Elisha to the Jordan (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-7.htm">2 Kings 2:7</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-17.htm">2 Kings 2:17</a>). These passages render it very probable that the sons of the prophets also lived in a common house. And this conjecture is raised into a certainty by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1</a>. In this passage, for example, they are represented as saying to Elisha: "The place where we sit before thee is too strait for us; let us go to the Jordan, and let each one fetch thence a beam, and build ourselves a place to dwell in there." It is true that we might, if necessary, supply &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1</a>, after &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, "to sit before thee," and so understand the words as merely referring to the erection of a more commodious place of meeting. But if they built it by the Jordan, we can hardly imagine that it was merely to serve as a place of meeting, to which they would have to make pilgrimages from a distance, but can only assume that they intended to live there, and assemble together under the superintendence of a prophet. In all probability, however, only such as were unmarried lived in a common building. Many of them were married, and therefore most likely lived in houses of their own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>.). We may also certainly assume the same with reference to the unions of prophets in the time of Samuel, even if it is impossible to prove that these unions continued uninterruptedly from the time of Samuel down to the times of Elijah and Elisha. Oehler argues in support of this, "that the historical connection, which can be traced in the influence of prophecy from the time of Samuel forwards, may be most easily explained from the uninterrupted continuance of these supports; and also that the large number of prophets, who must have been already there according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a> when Elijah first appeared, points to the existence of such unions as these." But the historical connection in the influence of prophecy, or, in other words, the uninterrupted succession of prophets, was also to be found in the kingdom of Judah both before and after the times of Elijah and Elisha, and down to the Babylonian captivity, without our discovering the slightest trace of any schools of the prophets in that kingdom.<p>All that can be inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a> is, that the large number of prophets mentioned there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>) were living in the time of Elijah, but not that they were there when he first appeared. The first mission of Elijah to king Ahab (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>) took place about three years before the events described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, and even this first appearance of the prophet in the presence of the king is not to be regarded as the commencement of his prophetic labours. How long Elijah had laboured before he announced to Ahab the judgment of three years' drought, cannot indeed be decided; but if we consider that he received instructions to call Elisha to be his assistant and successor not very long after this period of judgment had expired (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>.), we may certainly assume that he had laboured in Israel for many years, and may therefore have founded unions of the prophets. In addition, however, to the absence of any allusion to the continuance of these schools of the prophets, there is another thing which seems to preclude the idea that they were perpetuated from the time of Samuel to that of Elijah, viz., the fact that the schools which existed under Elijah and Elisha were only to be found in the kingdom of the ten tribes, and never in that of Judah, where we should certainly expect to find them if they had been handed down from Samuel's time. Moreover, Oehler also acknowledges that "the design of the schools of the prophets, and apparently their constitution, were not the same under Samuel as in the time of Elijah." This is confirmed by the fact, that the members of the prophets' unions which arose under Samuel are never called "sons of the prophets," as those who were under the superintendence of Elijah and Elisha invariably are (see the passages quoted above). Does not this peculiar epithet seem to indicate, that the "sons of the prophets" stood in a much more intimate relation to Elijah and Elisha, as their spiritual fathers, than the &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; or &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1514; did to Samuel as their president? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>.) &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; does not mean filii prophetae, i.e., sons who are prophets, as some maintain, though without being able to show that &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is ever used in this sense, but filii prophetarum, disciples or scholars of the prophets, from which it is very evident that these sons of the prophets stood in a relation of dependence to the prophets (Elijah and Elisha), i.e., of subordination to them, and followed their instructions and admonitions. They received commissions from them, and carried them out (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1</a>). On the other hand, the expressions &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; and &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1492; simply point to combinations for common working under the presidency of Samuel, although the words &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; certainly show that the direction of these unions, and probably the first impulse to form them, proceeded from Samuel, so that we might also call these societies schools of the prophets.<p>The opinions entertained with regard to the nature of these unions, and their importance in relation to the development of the kingdom of God in Israel, differ very widely from one another. Whilst some of the fathers (Jerome for example) looked upon them as an Old Testament order of monks; others, such as Tennemann, Meiners, and Winer, compare them to the Pythagorean societies. Kranichfeld supposes that they were free associations, and chose a distinguished prophet like Samuel as their president, in order that they might be able to cement their union the more firmly through his influence, and carry out their vocation with the greater success.<p>(Note: Compare Jerome (Epist. iv. ad Rustic. Monach. c. 7): "The sons of the prophets, whom we call the monks of the Old Testament, built themselves cells near the streams of the Jordan, and, forsaking the crowded cities, lived on meal and wild herbs." Compare with this his Epist. xiii. ad Paulin, c. 5.)<p>The truth lies between these two extremes. The latter view, which precludes almost every relation of dependence and community, is not reconcilable with the name "sons of the prophets," or with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>, where Samuel is said to have stood at the head of the prophesying prophets as &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, and has no support whatever in the Scriptures, but is simply founded upon the views of modern times and our ideas of liberty and equality. The prophets' unions had indeed so far a certain resemblance to the monastic orders of the early church, that the members lived together in the same buildings, and performed certain sacred duties in common; but if we look into the aim and purpose of monasticism, they were the very opposite of those of the prophetic life. The prophets did not wish to withdraw from the tumult of the world into solitude, for the purpose of carrying on a contemplative life of holiness in this retirement from the earthly life and its affairs; but their unions were associations formed for the purpose of mental and spiritual training, that they might exert a more powerful influence upon their contemporaries. They were called into existence by chosen instruments of the Lord, such as Samuel, Elijah, and Elisha, whom the Lord had called to be His prophets, and endowed with a peculiar measure of His Spirit for this particular calling, that they might check the decline of religious life in the nation, and bring back the rebellious "to the law and the testimony." Societies which follow this as their purpose in life, so long as they do not lose sight of it, will only separate and cut themselves off from the external world, so far as the world itself opposes them, and pursues them with hostility and persecution. The name "schools of the prophets" is the one which expresses most fully the character of these associations; only we must not think of them as merely educational institutions, in which the pupils of the prophets received instruction in prophesying or in theological studies.<p>(Note: Thus the Rabbins regarded them as &#1502;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;; and the earlier theologians as colleges, in which, as Vitringa expresses it, "philosophers, or if you please theologians, and candidates or students of theology, assembled for the purpose of devoting themselves assiduously to the study of divinity under the guidance of some one who was well skilled as a teacher;" whilst others regarded them as schools for the training of teachers for the people, and leaders in the worship of God. The English Deists - Morgan for example - regarded them as seats of scientific learning, in which the study of history, rhetoric, poetry, natural science, and moral philosophy was carried on.)<p>We are not in possession indeed of any minute information concerning their constitution. Prophesying could neither be taught nor communicated by instruction, but was a gift of God which He communicated according to His free will to whomsoever He would. But the communication of this divine gift was by no means an arbitrary thing, but presupposed such a mental and spiritual disposition on the part of the recipient as fitted him to receive it; whilst the exercise of the gift required a thorough acquaintance with the law and the earlier revelations of God, which the schools of the prophets were well adapted to promote. It is therefore justly and generally assumed, that the study of the law and of the history of the divine guidance of Israel formed a leading feature in the occupations of the pupils of the prophets, which also included the cultivation of sacred poetry and music, and united exercises for the promotion of the prophetic inspiration. That the study of the earlier revelations of God was carried on, may be very safely inferred from the fact that from the time of Samuel downwards the writing of sacred history formed an essential part of the prophet's labours, as has been already observed at pp. 8, 9 (translation). The cultivation of sacred music and poetry may be inferred partly from the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>, musicians walked in front of the prophesying prophets, playing as they went along, and partly also from the fact that sacred music not only received a fresh impulse from David, who stood in a close relation to the association of prophets at Ramah, but was also raised by him into an integral part of public worship. At the same time, music was by no means cultivated merely that the sons of the prophets might employ it in connection with their discourses, but also as means of awakening holy susceptibilities and emotions in the soul, and of lifting up the spirit of God, and so preparing it for the reception of divine revelations (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>). And lastly, we must include among the spiritual exercises prophesying in companies, as at Gibeah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>) and Ramah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>).<p>The outward occasion for the formation of these communities we have to seek for partly in the creative spirit of the prophets Samuel and Elijah, and partly in the circumstances of the times in which they lived. The time of Samuel forms a turning-point in the development of the Old Testament kingdom of God. Shortly after the call of Samuel the judgment fell upon the sanctuary, which had been profaned by the shameful conduct of the priests: the tabernacle lost the ark of the covenant, and ceased in consequence to be the scene of the gracious presence of God in Israel. Thus the task fell upon Samuel, as prophet of the Lord, to found a new house for that religious life which he had kindled, by collecting together into closer communities, those who had been awakened by his word, not only for the promotion of their own faith under his direction, but also for joining with him in the spread of the fear of God and obedience to the law of the Lord among their contemporaries. But just as, in the time of Samuel, it was the fall of the legal sanctuary and priesthood which created the necessity for the founding of schools of the prophets; so in the times of Elijah and Elisha, and in the kingdom of the ten tribes, it was the utter absence of any sanctuary of Jehovah which led these prophets to found societies of prophets, and so furnish the worshippers of Jehovah, who would not bend their knees to Baal, with places and means of edification, as a substitute for what the righteous in the kingdom of Judah possessed in the temple and the Levitical priesthood. But the reasons for the establishment of prophets' schools were not to be found merely in the circumstances of the times. There was a higher reason still, which must not be overlooked in our examination of these unions, and their importance in relation to the theocracy. We may learn from the fact that the disciples of the prophets who were associated together under Samuel are found prophesying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>), that they were also seized by the Spirit of God, and that the Divine Spirit which moved them exerted a powerful influence upon all who came into contact with them. Consequently the founding of associations of prophets is to be regarded as an operation of divine grace, which is generally manifested with all the greater might where sin most mightily abounds. As the Lord raised up prophets for His people at the times when apostasy had become great and strong, that they might resist idolatry with almighty power; so did He also create for himself organs of His Spirit in the schools of the prophets, who united with their spiritual fathers in fighting for His honour. It was by no means an accidental circumstance, therefore, that these unions are only met with in the times of Samuel and of the prophets Elijah and Elisha. These times resembled one another in the fact, that in both of them idolatry had gained the upper hand; though, at the same time, there were some respects in which they differed essentially from one another. In the time of Samuel the people did not manifest the same hostility to the prophets as in the time of Elijah. Samuel stood at the head of the nation as judge even during the reign of Saul; and after the rejection of the latter, he still stood so high in authority and esteem, that Saul never ventured to attack the prophets even in his madness. Elijah and Elisha, on the other hand, stood opposed to a royal house which was bent upon making the worship of Baal the leading religion of the kingdom; and they had to contend against priest of calves and prophets of Baal, who could only be compelled by hard strokes to acknowledge the Lord of Sabaoth and His prophets. In the case of the former, what had to be done was to bring the nation to a recognition of its apostasy, to foster the new life which was just awakening, and to remove whatever hindrances might be placed in its way by the monarchy. In the time of the latter, on the contrary, what was needed was "a compact phalanx to stand against the corruption which had penetrated so deeply into the nation." These differences in the times would certainly not be without their influence upon the constitution and operations of the schools of the prophets. </body></html>
