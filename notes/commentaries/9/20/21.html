It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The stone Ezel - It is not mentioned elsewhere, except possibly in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>, where see the note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. when thou hast stayed three days&#8212;either with your family at Beth-lehem, or wherever you find it convenient.<p>come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand&#8212;Hebrew, "in the day," or "time of the business," when the same matter was under inquiry formerly (1Sa 19:22).<p>remain by the stone Ezel&#8212;Hebrew, "the stone of the way"; a sort of milestone which directed travellers.

Jonathan commences with a solemn invocation of God: "Jehovah, God of Israel!" and thus introduces his oath. We have neither to supply "Jehovah is witness," nor "as truly as Jehovah liveth," as some have suggested. "When I inquire of my father about this time to-morrow, the day after to-morrow (a concise mode of saying 'to-morrow or the day after'), and behold it is (stands) well for David, and then I do not send to thee and make it known to thee, Jehovah shall do so to Jonathan," etc. ("The Lord do so," etc., the ordinary formula used in an oath: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>). The other case is then added without an adversative particle: "If it should please my father evil against thee (lit. as regards evil), "I will make it known to thee, and let thee go, that thou mayest go in peace; and Jehovah be with thee, as He has been with my father." In this wish there is expressed the presentiment that David would one day occupy that place in Israel which Saul occupied then, i.e., the throne. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-15.htm">1 Samuel 20:15</a> the Masoretic text gives no appropriate meaning. Luther's rendering, in which he follows the Rabbins and takes the first &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a>) by itself, and then completes the sentence from the context ("but if I do it not, show me no mercy, because I live, not even if I die"), contains indeed a certain permissible sense when considered in itself; but it is hardly reconcilable with what follows, "and do not tear away thy compassion for ever from my house." The request that he would show no compassion to him (Jonathan) even if he died, and yet would not withdraw his compassion from his house for ever, contains an antithesis which would have been expressed most clearly and unambiguously in the words themselves, if this had been really what Jonathan intended to say. De Wette's rendering gives a still more striking contradiction: "But let not (Jehovah be with thee) if I still live, and thou showest not the love of Jehovah to me, that I do not, and thou withdrawest not thy love from my house for ever." There is really no other course open than to follow the Syriac and Arabic, as Maurer, Thenius, and Ewald have done, and change the &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; in the first two clauses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a> into &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, according to the analogy of the form &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-30.htm">1 Samuel 14:30</a>), and to render the passage thus: "And mayest thou, if I still live, mayest thou show to me the favour of the Lord, and not if I do, not withdraw thy favour from my house for ever, not even (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488;) when Jehovah shall cut off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth!" "The favour of Jehovah" is favour such as Jehovah shall cut off," etc., shows very clearly Jonathan's conviction that Jehovah would give to David a victory over all his enemies.</body></html>
