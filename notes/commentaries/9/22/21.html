It is great trouble to a good man to find himself any way the cause of evil to others. He must have been much pained, when he considered that his falsehood was one cause of this fatal event. David speaks with assurance of his own safety, and promises that Abiathar should have his protection. With the Son of David, all who are his may be sure they shall be in safeguard, Ps 91:1. In the hurry and distraction David was continually in, he found time for communion with God, and found comfort in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abiathar - He may have remained at Nob to take care of the sanctuary when the other priests went to Saul, and so escaped.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a>, he is spoken of as the High Priest who gave the showbread to David. Perhaps he was the instigator of this act of kindness to David; and for this cause, as well as his constancy to David, is mentioned by our Lord instead of Ahimelech. It is also possible that, as sagan to his father, he may have performed most of the priestly functions, as Hophni and Phinehas did in the lifetime of Eli. Abiathar did not actually join David until he went to Keilah (marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 22:20-23.

On hearing his sad tale, David declared that he had dreaded such a fatal result from the malice and intriguing ambition of Doeg; and, accusing himself as having been the occasion of all the disaster to Abiathar's family, David invited him to remain, because, firmly trusting himself in the accomplishment of the divine promise, David could guarantee protection to him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the Lord's priests.

To Saul's appeal, "Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, by giving him bread?" Ahimelech, who was not conscious of any such crime, since David had come to him with a false pretext, and the priest had probably but very little knowledge of what took place at court, replied both calmly and worthily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-14.htm">1 Samuel 22:14</a>): "And who of all thy servants is so faithful (proved, attested, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>) as David, and son-in-law of the king, and having access to thy private audience, and honoured in thy house?"

This is the explanation given by Gesenius and most of the modern expositors, whereas the early translators entirely misunderstood the passage, though they have given the meaning correctly enough at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a>. But if this was the relation in which David stood to Saul, - and he had really done so for a long time, - there was nothing wrong in what the high priest had done for him; but he had acted according to the best of his knowledge, and quite conscientiously as a faithful subject of the king. Ahimelech then added still further (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-15.htm">1 Samuel 22:15</a>): "Did I then begin to inquire of God for him this day?" i.e., was it the first time that I had obtained the decision of God for David concerning important enterprises, which he had to carry out in the service of the king? "Far be from me," sc., any conspiracy against the king, like that of which I am accused. "Let not the king lay it as a burden upon thy servant, my whole father's house (the omission of the cop. &#1493; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; may be accounted for from the excitement of the speaker); for thy servant knows not the least of all this." &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, of all that Saul had charged him with. </body></html>
