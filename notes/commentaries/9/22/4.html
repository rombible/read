The Son of David is ready to receive distressed souls, who will be commanded by him. He receives all who come unto Him, however vile and miserable; he changes them into a holy people, and employs them in his service: those who would reign with him must be contented first to suffer with and for him. Observe with what tender concern David provided for his aged parents. The first thing he does is to find them a quiet habitation, whatever became of himself. Let children learn to honour their parents, in every thing consulting their ease and satisfaction. Though highly preferred, and much employed, let them not forget their aged parents. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. And the Lord will preserve his people for their appointed work, however they may be hated and exposed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He brought them before ... - The Septuagint renders it "he persuaded (the face of) the king."<p>In the hold - Where David was after he left the cave of Adullam, probably in the land of Moab.<p>The phrase "all the while," would indicate that David sojourned a considerable time in Moab. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab&#8212;"Mizpeh" signifies a watchtower, and it is evident that it must be taken in this sense here, for it is called "the hold" or fort (1Sa 22:4). The king of Moab was an enemy of Saul (1Sa 14:47), and the great-grandson of Ruth, of course, was related to the family of Jesse. David, therefore, had less anxiety in seeking an asylum within the dominions of this prince than those of Achish, because the Moabites had no grounds for entertaining vindictive feelings against him, and their enmity, to Saul rendered them the more willing to receive so illustrious a refugee from his court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Before the king of Moab; </span> into his presence, that he might see them, and give them leave to dwell in his dominion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the hold; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The Jews (z) say the king of Moab slew his father and his mother, and his brethren, all but one, whom Nahash the Ammonite preserved; and is the kindness David speaks of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>; and if this was the case, now it was that his father and mother forsook him, and God took him up, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>. <p>(z) Bemnidbar Rabba, sect. 14. fol. 212. 1.

What became of David’s parents when he quitted the hold does not appear. A Jewish tradition affirms that the king of Moab betrayed his trust and murdered them, for which David exacted a heavy vengeance when he came to the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm" title="And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.

In order to escape this danger, "he disguised his understanding (i.e., pretended to be out of his mind) in their eyes (i.e., before the courtiers of Achish), behaved insanely under their hands (when they tried to hold him as a madman), scribbled upon the door-wings, and let his spittle run down into his beard." The suffix to &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493; is apparently superfluous, as the object, &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;, follows immediately afterwards. But it may be accounted for from the circumstantiality of the conversation of every-day life, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6</a>, and (though these cases are not perfectly parallel) <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a> (cf.
