The word means <span class= "ital">a watch tower; </span>it was probably some mountain fortress in Moab. It has been suggested that it was the same as Zophim, a word of the same root as Mizpeh (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-14.htm" title="And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.">Numbers 23:14</a>). David evidently sought hospitality among his kin in Moab. Jesse, his father, was the grandson of Ruth the Moabitess. The distance from the south of Judah Where the fugitives were wandering was not great.<p><span class= "bld">Till I know what God will do for me.</span>—This memory of David’s words to the King of Moab shows that the old trust and love, which in his first moments of care and sorrow had failed him, had come back again to the son of Jesse. It is interesting to note that David when addressing the Moabite sovereign speaks of “God” “Elohim,” not of Jehovah. This was probably out of deep reverence; an idolator had nothing to do with the awful name by which the Eternal was known to His covenant people—a Name which, as originally uttered, has now passed away from the earth. We read the mystic four letters, but no man, Jew or Gentile, can pronounce the Name of Names. The “Name,” however, was not unknown in Moab, for the mystic letters which compose it occur in the inscription of Mesha, dating about 150 years from the days of David’s exile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-3.htm" title="And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.">1 Samuel 22:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">David went </span>from <span class="ital">thence to Mizpeh — </span>For the Moabites were at difference with Saul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1 Samuel 14:47</a>. <span class="ital">Let my father and my mother be with you — </span>David, perhaps, the rather hoped for this kindness to be shown to his aged parents, who were not able to travel up and down, as he was likely to be obliged to do, because he was descended from Ruth, a Moabitess. The filial tenderness of David here deserves our admiration, who makes it his first care to fix his parents in a place of safety and ease, not being able to bear their being exposed to the dangers and hardships which the necessity of his affairs obliged him to undergo. His address to the king manifests his great tenderness to his parents, and his entire submission to the <span class="ital">will of God. Till I know what God will do for me — </span>He expresses his hopes very modestly, as one that had entirely cast himself upon God, and committed his way to him, trusting not in his own arts or arms, but in the wisdom, power, and goodness of God. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 See what weak instruments God sometimes uses, to bring about his own purposes. The Son of David is ready to receive distressed souls, who will be commanded by him. He receives all who come unto Him, however vile and miserable; he changes them into a holy people, and employs them in his service: those who would reign with him must be contented first to suffer with and for him. Observe with what tender concern David provided for his aged parents. The first thing he does is to find them a quiet habitation, whatever became of himself. Let children learn to honour their parents, in every thing consulting their ease and satisfaction. Though highly preferred, and much employed, let them not forget their aged parents. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. And the Lord will preserve his people for their appointed work, however they may be hated and exposed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mizpeh of Moab - A good conjecture connects it with "Zophim" (a word of the same root as Mizpeh) on the top of Pisgah <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-14.htm">Numbers 23:14</a>. It is probable that David's descent from Ruth the Moabitess may have had something to do with his seeking an asylum for Jesse, Ruth's grandson, in the land of her birth. It would be very easy to get to the Jordan from the neighborhood of Bethlehem, and cross over near its embouchure into the Dead Sea.<p>Come forth, and be with you - The construction of the Hebrew is very strange.

David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab&#8212;"Mizpeh" signifies a watchtower, and it is evident that it must be taken in this sense here, for it is called "the hold" or fort (1Sa 22:4). The king of Moab was an enemy of Saul (1Sa 14:47), and the great-grandson of Ruth, of course, was related to the family of Jesse. David, therefore, had less anxiety in seeking an asylum within the dominions of this prince than those of Achish, because the Moabites had no grounds for entertaining vindictive feelings against him, and their enmity, to Saul rendered them the more willing to receive so illustrious a refugee from his court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mizpeh of Moab; </span> so called, to distinguish it from that Mizpeh, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm" title="And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.">1 Samuel 7:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He said unto the king of Moab; </span> partly because he was related to and descended from one of his people, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-10.htm" title="Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.">Ruth 4:10</a></span>; and partly because he was Saul’s enemy, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1 Samuel 14:47</a></span>, and therefore more likely to be David’s friend. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My father and my mother, </span> who being very aged, were not able to endure those journeys and hardships which David foresaw that he was likely to be exposed to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Till I know what God will do for me; </span> till I see the accomplishment of God’s promise made to me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab,.... So called to distinguish it from a place of the same name in the land of Israel; which Junius says is the same with Malle, and signifies a fortified place, and refers to the Apocrypha:"And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities are strong and great:'' (1 Maccabees 5:26)here he might think himself safer, though in an enemy's country, than in the land of Israel: <p>and he said unto the king of Moab, let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth; out of the land of Israel, or out of the cave of Adullam, whither they were come to him: <p>and be with you; if not with the king of Moab at his court, yet in some part or other of his country, where they might be safe from the rage of Saul: <p>till I know what God will do for me; on whose power and providence he wholly relied, and not upon the men that flocked to him, nor upon his own power and policy, courage and wisdom; he knew the promise of God to him, and he put his trust in him for the performance of it; but knew not the time, nor way, and manner, in which it would be performed; and expected in the meanwhile to be obliged to remove from place to place; and considering that his aged parents were not fit for such quick and sudden motions, and long flights, he provided as well as he could for their settlement; which was an instance of his filial affection for them, and piety towards them. His father's name is well known, Jesse, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-22.htm">Ruth 4:22</a>, &amp;c. but his mother's name is nowhere mentioned; the Jews say her name was Natzbet, the daughter of Adal (y). <p>(y) T.

Perhaps either the strong rock citadel afterwards known as Kir-Moab, now <span class="ital">Kerak</span> is meant: or some place not in Moab proper, but on the mountains of Abarim or Pisgah north of the Arnon, which would be more easily accessible from Bethlehem by way of Jericho. The long purple wall of the mountains of Moab is a striking feature in the view from Bethlehem (<span class="ital">Sin. and Pal</span>. p. 104), and would naturally suggest a retreat thither: but no doubt it was his connexion with Moab through his great-grandmother Ruth, which chiefly induced David to choose that country as a refuge for his parents.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab</span>. The position of this place is unknown, but as the word means a <span class="accented">watch tower</span>, it was no doubt some beacon hill in the highlands of Moab on the east of the Dead Sea, and probably in the mountains of Abarim or Pisgah. Here David placed his father and mother under the care of the king of Moab. They had fled from Bethlehem under the combined fear of Saul and the Philistines, but were too old to bear the fatigues of David's life. He therefore asks for a refuge for them with the king of Moab, probably on the ground that Jesse's grandmother, Ruth, was a Moabitess. But as Saul had waged war on Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>), the king was probably glad to help one who would keep Saul employed at home. The language of David is remarkable, and is literally, "Let, I pray, my father and my mother come forth with you" (pl.); but no better interpretation has been suggested than that in the A.V.: "Let them come forth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the hold in Mizpeh, to be or dwell with you." <span class="cmt_word">While David was in the hold.</span> Not merely that in the land of Moab, but up to the time when David was settled in Hebron. During all this period David was wandering from one natural fortress to another. <span class="cmt_word">Till I know what God will do for</span> (or to) <span class="cmt_word">me</span>. These words show that David had recovered his composure, and was willing calmly to leave everything to the wise disposal of God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But David took these words to heart, and was in great fear of Achish, lest he should treat him as an enemy, and kill him. In order to escape this danger, "he disguised his understanding (i.e., pretended to be out of his mind) in their eyes (i.e., before the courtiers of Achish), behaved insanely under their hands (when they tried to hold him as a madman), scribbled upon the door-wings, and let his spittle run down into his beard." The suffix to &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493; is apparently superfluous, as the object, &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;, follows immediately afterwards. But it may be accounted for from the circumstantiality of the conversation of every-day life, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-6.htm">2 Samuel 14:6</a>, and (though these cases are not perfectly parallel) <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3</a> (cf.
