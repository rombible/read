In the latter case his sin consisted in disobeying the word of God, who had bidden him wait until Samuel came. And this is, on the whole, the more probable; since Samuel's rebuke says nothing of any assumption of priesthood, such as we read in the case of Uzziah <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 13:9-16. Saul, Weary of Waiting for Samuel, Sacrifices.<p>9-14. Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings&#8212;Saul, though patriotic enough in his own way, was more ambitious of gaining the glory of a triumph to himself than ascribing it to God. He did not understand his proper position as king of Israel; and although aware of the restrictions under which he held the sovereignty, he wished to rule as an autocrat, who possessed absolute power both in civil and sacred things. This occasion was his first trial. Samuel waited till the last day of the seven, in order to put the constitutional character of the king to the test; and, as Saul, in his impatient and passionate haste knowingly transgressed (1Sa 13:12) by invading the priest's office and thus showing his unfitness for his high office (as he showed nothing of the faith of Gideon and other Hebrew generals), he incurred a threat of the rejection which his subsequent waywardness confirmed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Behold, Samuel came, </span> i.e. it was told Saul, Behold, Samuel is coming. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Salute him, </span> i.e. congratulate his coming.

It is evident that Samuel came on the seventh day, and that Saul in his impetuosity could not stay the whole day out. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba," probably the military post mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>, which had been advanced in the meantime as far as Geba. For Geba is not to be confounded with Gibeah, from which it is clearly distinguished in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a> as compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-15.htm">1 Samuel 13:15</a>, but is the modern Jeba, between the Wady Suweinit and Wady Fara, to the north-west of Ramah (er-Rm; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>). "The Philistines heard this. And Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the whole land, and proclamation made: let the Hebrews hear it." &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; after &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506; points out the proclamation that was made after the alarm given by the shophar (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-34.htm">1 Kings 1:34</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>, etc.). The object to "let them hear" may be easily supplied from the context, viz., Jonathan's feat of arms. Saul had this trumpeted in the whole land, not only as a joyful message for the Hebrews, but also as an indirect summons to the whole nation to rise and make war upon the Philistines. In the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (hear), there is often involved the idea of observing, laying to heart that which is heard. If we understand &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; in this sense here, and the next verse decidedly hints at it, there is no ground whatever for the objection which Thenius, who follows the lxx, has raised to &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;. He proposes this emendation, &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, "let the Hebrews fall away," according to the Alex. text &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, without reflecting that the very expression &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; is sufficient to render the Alex. reading suspicious, and that Saul could not have summoned the people in all the land to fall away from the Philistines, since they had not yet conquered and taken possession of the whole. Moreover, the correctness of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is confirmed by &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1493;&#1499;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-4.htm">1 Samuel 13:4</a>. "All Israel heard," not the call to fall away, but the news, "Saul has smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and Israel has also made itself stinking with the Philistines," i.e., hated in consequence of the bold and successful attack made by Jonathan, which proved that the Israelites would no longer allow themselves to be oppressed by the Philistines. "And the people let themselves be called together after Saul to Gilgal." &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;, to permit to summon to war (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23-24</a>). The words are incorrectly rendered by the Vulgate, "clamavit ergo populus post Saul," and by Luther, "Then the people cried after Saul to Gilgal." Saul drew back to Gilgal, when the Philistines advanced with a large army, to make preparations for the further conflict (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>).</body></html>
