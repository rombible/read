How impolitic Saul was, who did not, in the beginning of his reign, set himself to redress this. Want of true sense always accompanies want of grace. Sins which appear to us very little, have dangerous consequences. Miserable is a guilty, defenceless nation; much more those who are destitute of the whole armour of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The spoilers - "The devastator:" the same word is used of the destroying Angel <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>. The verse describes the system adopted by the Philistines by which for a time they subjugated the Israelites. From their central camp at Michmash they sent out three bands to kill and lay waste and destroy. One took a northerly direction toward Ophrah - five miles east of Bethel, identified with "Ephrain" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a> and the modern "Taiyibeh," - and toward the land of Shual, possibly the same as Shalim <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>; the second westward to Beth-horon; and the third eastward, by the unknown valley of Zeboim, toward the wilderness, i. e., the Jordan valley, toward Jericho. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18. the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies&#8212;ravaging through the three valleys which radiate from the uplands of Michmash to Ophrah on the north, through the pass of Beth-horon on the west, and down the ravines of Zeboim ("the hy&aelig;nas"), towards the Ghor or Jordan valley on the east.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Beth-boron; </span> a city of Ephraim, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm" title="And goes down westward to the coast of Japhleti, to the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the sea.">Joshua 16:3</a></span>. north-west from Michmash. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The wilderness, </span> i.e. the wilderness of Jordan, eastward. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And another company turned the way to Bethhoron,....

Saul replied, "When I saw that the people were scattered away from me, and thou camest not at the time appointed, and the Philistines were assembled at Michmash, I thought the Philistines will come down to me to Gilgal now (to attack me), before I have entreated the face of Jehovah; and I overcame myself, and offered the burnt-offering." &#1497;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>.</body></html>
