Perhaps the noble old man still hoped that the brilliant and gallant king would recognise his fatal error.<p>From Gilgal, we read, Samuel passed to Gibeah of Benjamin, the home of Saul: there, no doubt, he took counsel with and encouraged Jonathan, who was stationed there, and whose splendid gallantry was soon after to be called into action again.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul numbered the people.</span>—The disobedience of Saul had availed nothing. Instead of being able to lead a host against the Philistine army, the camp of Israel became deserted. Even his small division of regulars seems to have melted away; only six hundred answered to the despairing king’s roll-call. It would seem as though the Divine punishment had begun already.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/13-15.htm" title="And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.

How impolitic Saul was, who did not, in the beginning of his reign, set himself to redress this. Want of true sense always accompanies want of grace. Sins which appear to us very little, have dangerous consequences. Miserable is a guilty, defenceless nation; much more those who are destitute of the whole armour of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Samuel arose - Saul could not return to his own station at Michmash, seeing it was occupied by the Philistines; so, perhaps by Samuel's advice (since, according to the text, he preceded him there), he effected a junction with Jonathan at Gibeah.

Even if this be not so, yet friendly relations must have continued between Saul and Samuel, as the latter would otherwise certainly not have chosen Saul's home for his halting place; nor would he go thither without seeing Jonathan, and giving him aid and counsel. Saul numbered. See on 1 Samuel 11:8. After summoning the whole nation there did not remain with him even as many as a third of his selected band. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Saul then resolved, in his anxiety lest the people should lose all heart and forsake him altogether if there were any further delay, that he would offer the sacrifice without Samuel. &#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; does not imply that Saul offered the sacrifice with his own hand, i.e., that he performed the priestly function upon this occasion. The co-operation of the priests in performing the duties belonging to them on such an occasion is taken for granted, just as in the case of the sacrifices offered by David and Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>).</body></html>
