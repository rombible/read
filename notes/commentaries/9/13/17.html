Probably the allied forces were now suffered to leave the Philistine host, and we next hear of the old raids re-commencing. The three companies spoken of in this and the next verse were directed to ravage districts in the tribe of Benjamin, for in that locality are situated all the places mentioned. Unchecked, they seem to have carried out their plans. These armed companies swept away all the smithies in the south part of the land. The fortunes of Saul now reached their lowest ebb. “The heights of his own tribe . . . and the passes of his own tribe were occupied by hostile garrisons. We see him leaning on his gigantic spear, whether it be on the summit of the Rock Rimmon . . . or under the tamarisk of Ramah . . . or on the heights of Gibeah. There he stood with his small band, the faithful six hundred, and as he wept aloud over the misfortunes of his country . . . another voice swelled the wild, indignant lament—the voice of Jonathan, his son.”—Dean Stanley: <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:15-23 See how politic the Philistines were when they had power; they not only prevented the people of Israel from making weapons of war, but obliged them to depend upon their enemies, even for instruments of husbandry. How impolitic Saul was, who did not, in the beginning of his reign, set himself to redress this. Want of true sense always accompanies want of grace. Sins which appear to us very little, have dangerous consequences. Miserable is a guilty, defenceless nation; much more those who are destitute of the whole armour of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The spoilers - "The devastator:" the same word is used of the destroying Angel <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>. The verse describes the system adopted by the Philistines by which for a time they subjugated the Israelites. From their central camp at Michmash they sent out three bands to kill and lay waste and destroy. One took a northerly direction toward Ophrah - five miles east of Bethel, identified with "Ephrain" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a> and the modern "Taiyibeh," - and toward the land of Shual, possibly the same as Shalim <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>; the second westward to Beth-horon; and the third eastward, by the unknown valley of Zeboim, toward the wilderness, i. e., the Jordan valley, toward Jericho. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18. the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies&#8212;ravaging through the three valleys which radiate from the uplands of Michmash to Ophrah on the north, through the pass of Beth-horon on the west, and down the ravines of Zeboim ("the hy&aelig;nas"), towards the Ghor or Jordan valley on the east.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In three companies; </span> that they might march several ways, and so waste several parts of the country. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ophrah; </span> a city of Benjamin, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-23.htm" title="And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,">Joshua 18:23</a></span>, south-west from Michmash. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies,....

The tense of the verbs “turned” expresses repeated action, indicating that these ravages were continued for some time.

They ought to have pounced at once upon Saul in the plain of Jordan, where their cavalry would have secured for them the victory, and then, following Samuel's and Saul's route, have seized the other end of the defile, and overpowered Jonathan. But they despised them both, and regarding the country as conquered, proceed to punish it, as probably they had cone on previous occasions, when no one had dared to make resistance. Leaving then the main army to guard the camp at Michmash, they sent out light armed troops to plunder the whole land. <span class="cmt_word">One company turned unto the way...  to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual.</span> This company went northward, towards Ophrah, a place five miles east of Bethel. The land of Shual, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fox land, was probably the same as the land of Shalim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Another company,</span> etc. This went eastward, towards Beth-heron, for which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>. The third went to the south east, towards the wilderness of Judaea. Zeboim, and all the places mentioned, are in the tribe of Benjamin, which had committed the offence of making for itself a king. To the south Saul held the mountain fastnesses towards Jerusalem.

Saul replied, "When I saw that the people were scattered away from me, and thou camest not at the time appointed, and the Philistines were assembled at Michmash, I thought the Philistines will come down to me to Gilgal now (to attack me), before I have entreated the face of Jehovah; and I overcame myself, and offered the burnt-offering." &#1497;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>.</body></html>
