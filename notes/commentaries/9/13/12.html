Instead of that, the people fled, leaving him in the exposed plain with only 600 men <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-15.htm">1 Samuel 13:15</a>. The Philistines occupied Michmash, and might at any moment pour down the valley upon Gilgal. Saul's situation was obviously one of extreme peril. A few hours' delay might prove fatal to him and his little army. Hence, he "forced" himself, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 13:9-16. Saul, Weary of Waiting for Samuel, Sacrifices.<p>9-14. Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings&#8212;Saul, though patriotic enough in his own way, was more ambitious of gaining the glory of a triumph to himself than ascribing it to God. He did not understand his proper position as king of Israel; and although aware of the restrictions under which he held the sovereignty, he wished to rule as an autocrat, who possessed absolute power both in civil and sacred things. This occasion was his first trial. Samuel waited till the last day of the seven, in order to put the constitutional character of the king to the test; and, as Saul, in his impatient and passionate haste knowingly transgressed (1Sa 13:12) by invading the priest's office and thus showing his unfitness for his high office (as he showed nothing of the faith of Gideon and other Hebrew generals), he incurred a threat of the rejection which his subsequent waywardness confirmed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have not made supplication to the Lord; </span> hence it appears that sacrifices were accompanied with solemn prayers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I forced myself; </span> I did it against my own mind and inclination.

This is not only favoured by the expression &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; (the Philistines will come down from Michmash to Gilgal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-12.htm">1 Samuel 13:12</a>), but also by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; (Samuel went up from Gilgal to Gibeah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-15.htm">1 Samuel 13:15</a>), and by the general attitude of Saul and his army towards the Philistines. As the Philistines advanced with a powerful army, after Jonathan's victory over their garrison at Geba (to the south of Michmash), and encamped at Michmash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>); and Saul, after withdrawing from Gilgal, where he had gathered the Israelites together (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-4.htm">1 Samuel 13:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-12.htm">1 Samuel 13:12</a>), with Jonathan and the six hundred men who were with him when the muster took place, took up his position at Geba (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-15.htm">1 Samuel 13:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a>), from which point Jonathan attacked the Philistine post in the pass of Michmash (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-1.htm">1 Samuel 14:1</a>.): Saul must have drawn back from the advancing army of the Philistines to the Gilgal in the Jordan valley, to make ready for the battle by collecting soldiers and presenting sacrifices, and then, after this had been done, must have advanced once more to Gibeah and Geba to commence the war with the army of the Philistines that was encamped at Michmash. If, on the other hand, he had gone northwards to Jiljilia from Michmash, where he was first stationed, to escape the advancing army of the Philistines; he would have had to attack the Philistines from the north when they were encamped at Michmash, and could not possibly have returned to Geba without coming into conflict with the Philistines, since Michmash was situated between Jiljilia and Geba. </body></html>
