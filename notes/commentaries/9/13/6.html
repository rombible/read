The tradition preserved by Josephus tells us that a host of foreign allies had joined the Phœnician armies in this war. This accounts for the great numbers alluded to in the text: “People as the sand which <span class= "ital">is </span>on the sea shore in multitude” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm" title="And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.">1Samuel 13:5</a>). The hearts of the as yet undisciplined Hebrews sank at the tidings of such an invasion. And in high places.—The word in the original Hebrew is not the same as the one usually rendered “high places” for prayer and sacrifice. The word here signifies towers. It is the same word which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm" title="And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.">Judges 9:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-49.htm" title="And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.">Judges 9:49</a> is translated “a hold.” In the <span class= "ital">Speaker’s Commentary </span>it is suggested that it was applied to a particular kind of tower which was the work of the old Canaanite inhabitants, and which remained as ruins in the time of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm" title="When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.">1 Samuel 13:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Israel saw that they were in a strait — </span>Though their wonderful success against the Ammonites had encouraged them to obey the summons of such a prosperous leader as Saul had been; yet when they saw the vast army of the Philistines, how well they were appointed, and themselves unprovided, their hearts failed them, and they slunk away from him as fast as they had flocked to him. <span class="ital">The people were distressed — </span>Notwithstanding their former presumption, that if they had a king they would be free from all such difficulties and distresses.

For above a year he gave the Philistine time to prepare for war, and to weaken and to disarm the Israelites. When men are lifted up in self-sufficiency, they are often led into folly. The chief advantages of the enemies of the church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends. When Saul at length sounded an alarm, the people, dissatisfied with his management, or terrified by the power of the enemy, did not come to him, or speedily deserted him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In thickets - literally, "among thorns."<p>High places - Not the high places for worship, but holds or towers <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-49.htm">Judges 9:49</a>; that particular kind of tower which was the work of the old Canaanite inhabitants, and which remained as ruins in the time of Saul. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 13:6-8. The Israelites' Distress.<p>6. When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait&#8212;Though Saul's gallantry was unabated, his subjects displayed no degree of zeal and energy. Instead of venturing an encounter, they fled in all directions. Some, in their panic, left the country (1Sa 13:7), but most took refuge in the hiding-places which the broken ridges of the neighborhood abundantly afford. The rocks are perforated in every direction with "caves," and "holes," and "pits"&#8212;crevices and fissures sunk deep in the rocky soil, subterranean granaries or dry wells in the adjoining fields.

By reason of the vast army that the Philistines brought into the field, greatly superior to theirs, and were likely to be encompassed by them on every side; so that nothing but destruction was expected, which gave them the utmost anxiety and uneasiness; though Abarbinel refers this last clause, not to the people of Israel, but to the people of the Philistines, and takes it in this sense: <p>for the people drew nigh; the army of the Philistines was approaching, and got near to them; and so they were in great danger of being quickly attacked by them, and destroyed, their numbers being so great: <p>then the people did hide themselves in caves; of which there were many in the land of Judea, capable of receiving a large number, as the cave of Adullam, the cave of Engedi, &amp;c. and such as the Israelites made to hide themselves when oppressed by the Midianites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>. <p>and in thickets; woods and forests, or among thorns, as Jarchi; where there was a very great number of brambles and thorn bushes; some, as Kimchi, interpret the word of munitions, garrisons, and fortified places, to which they betook themselves: <p>in rocks, and in high places, and in pits; in the holes of rocks and mountains, particularly in Mount Ephraim; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-22.htm">1 Samuel 14:22</a> and where there were any pits or ditches, high or deep places, where they might be out of sight, and be sheltered from their enemies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">in a strait</span>] In distress and danger: as it were, hemmed in and unable to turn in any direction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the people did hide themselves</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-2.htm" title="And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.">Jdg 6:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in high places</span>] The word thus translated occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm" title="And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.">Jdg 9:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-49.htm" title="And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.">Jdg 9:49</a> (E.

The Philistines had so promptly answered Saul's challenge, that the Israelites, forgetting their victory over Nahash, whose men, however, had probably very inferior arms to those worn by the Philistines, lost courage; and even the picked band of 2000 men dwindled to 600. As for the mass of the people, they acted with the most abject cowardice, hiding themselves in <span class="cmt_word">caves</span>, of which there are very many in the limestone ranges of Palestine. David subsequently found safety in them when hunted by Saul. Also <span class="cmt_word">in thickets.</span> The word as spelt here occurs nowhere else, nor do the versions agree as to its meaning. Most probably it signifies <span class="accented">clefts</span>, rifts or fissures in the <span class="cmt_word">rocks</span>. The next word, rocks, certainly means precipitous <span class="accented">cliffs</span>; and thickets or thorn bushes would scarcely be placed between caverns and cliffs, both of which belong to mountains. <span class="cmt_word">In high places.</span> This word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46, 49</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">hold.</span> But this meaning is not supported by the ancient versions, and it more probably signifies a vault or crypt, which better suits the hiding place next mentioned, <span class="cmt_word">pits</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> tanks, artificial reservoirs for water, with which most districts were well supplied in Palestine, even before its conquest by Israel. They were absolutely necessary, as the rains fall only at stated periods, and the chalky soil will not hold water; when dry they would form fit places for concealment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Lastly, he repeats once more his admonition, that they would continue stedfast in the fear of God, threatening at the same time the destruction of both king and people if they should do wrong (on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>, where the form &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is also found).
