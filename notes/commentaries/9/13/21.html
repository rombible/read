Gesenius and the majority of modern scholars, however, render the word in the original translated “file” (<span class= "ital">p’tsirah</span>) by “bluntness.” The passage then would run: “And there was bluntness (or dulness) of edge to the mattocks; “or,” so that bluntness of the edges occurred to the mattocks.” “The forks” were probably an instrument with three prongs, like our trident.<p><span class= "bld">And to sharpen the goads.</span>—The words from “and there was bluntness,” &c. (English Version, “they had a file”), down to “axes,” form a parenthesis.<p>“This parenthesis indicates that the result of the burthensome necessity of going to the Philistines was that many tools became useless by dulness, so that even these poorer sort of arms did the Israelites not much service at the breaking out of the war.”—Bunsen.<p>The LXX. read this 21st verse with considerable changes: “And the vintage was ready to be gathered, and the tools were three shekels to the tooth to sharpen], and to the axe and to the scythe there was the same rate” (or, as the Greek has been rendered,” tools cost three shekels apiece [to sharpen]”).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:15-23 See how politic the Philistines were when they had power; they not only prevented the people of Israel from making weapons of war, but obliged them to depend upon their enemies, even for instruments of husbandry. How impolitic Saul was, who did not, in the beginning of his reign, set himself to redress this. Want of true sense always accompanies want of grace. Sins which appear to us very little, have dangerous consequences. Miserable is a guilty, defenceless nation; much more those who are destitute of the whole armour of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The best rendering of the passage is perhaps as follows: "But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen etc. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a>, whenever there was bluntness of edge to their shares and coulters and prong-forks and axes, and to point their goads." Coulters and mattocks were cutting instruments of the type of the share. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Yet they had a file&#8212;as a kind of privilege, for the purpose of sharpening sundry smaller utensils of husbandry.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So the sense is, They allowed them some small helps to make their mattocks, and in some sort to serve their present use. But these words may be otherwise translated, and are so by some learned, both ancient and modern, translators: thus, <span class="ital">Therefore the mouths or edges of the mattocks a coulters</span>, &.<span class="ital"> were dull or blunt</span>. Or rather thus, <span class="ital">When</span> (Heb. <span class="ital">and</span> put for <span class="ital">when</span>, as the particle <span class="ital">and</span> is sometimes rendered, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-25.htm" title="And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.">Mark 15:25</a></span>) <span class="ital">the mouths or edges of the mattocks</span>, &c. <span class="ital">were blunt</span>. So this passage very well agrees both with the foregoing and following words; and the whole sense of the place is entirely thus, They <span class="ital">went to the Philistines to sharpen their shares, and mattocks, and coulters, and axes, when they were blunt</span>, and (which was more strange, they were forced to go to them even) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">to sharpen their goads.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes,.... Those that would not go to the Philistines, or were not able, or thought it too much trouble, these kept files by them to sharpen those several instruments with upon occasion; though the words are by some rendered in connection with the preceding, to this sense, that they went to the Philistines to sharpen them, when the mouths, or edges, of the mattocks, coulters, &amp;c. were dull; or "blunt" (i); and so needed sharpening; and even <p>to sharpen the goads; with which they pricked and pushed on the oxen in ploughing, when sluggish and remiss. (The word for "file" in the verse is "pim", and occurs only here in the Hebrew scriptures. It is not used elsewhere in other Hebrew writings. Therefore the translators of the 1611 Authorised Version had only the root derivation to deduce what the word meant. Literally, it means "a file with mouths". However, recently archaeologists have found a stone inscribed with this word. Also they found a stone inscribed with the word "shekel". Hence they deduced that the word was really a weight of measure equal to about one third of a shekel. Newer translations usually translate this as "the charge was a third of a shekel ...", hence removing the obvious contradiction between this verse and the preceding one.

If the rendering is correct, the meaning will be that for the ordinary sharpening of tools they had files, but for any forging work they had to go to the Philistines. But the best rendering appears to be either, <span class="bld">“When the edges, &c. were blunt:”</span> or that of the Vulgate, <span class="bld">“So the edges of the mattocks … used to be blunt.”</span> The result of the necessity of going so far to get their tools repaired was that they got into a very unserviceable condition. The words, “and to <span class="bld">set</span> (i.e. sharpen or point) the goad” must be taken as depending on “the Israelites went down to the Philistines,” the intervening words being regarded as a parenthesis.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A file.</span> Margin, <span class="accented">a file with mouths.</span> The word only occurs here, and is translated a file on the authority of Rashi. Almost all modern commentators agree that it means <span class="accented">bluntness</span>, and that this verse should be joined on to the preceding, and the two be translated, "But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his sickle, and his ploughshare, and his axe, and his mattock, whenever the edges of the mattocks, and the ploughshares, and the forks, and the axes were blunt, and also to set (so the margin rightly) the goads." The Israelites were thus in a state of complete dependence upon the Philistines, even for carrying on their agriculture, and probably retained only the hill country, while their enemies were masters of the plains. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this occurrence Samuel went up to Gibeah, and Saul mustered the people who were with him, about six hundred men. Consequently Saul had not even accomplished the object of his unseasonable sacrifice, namely, to prevent the dispersion of the people. With this remark the account of the occurrence that decided the fate of Saul's monarchy is brought to a close. </body></html>
