But although God threatened Saul with the loss of his kingdom for his sin, yet, it is not improbable, there was a tacit condition implied, namely, if he did not repent of this, and of all his sins; for the full, and final, and peremptory sentence of Saul’s rejection is plainly ascribed to another cause, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm" title="It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.

But, “was not this a severe sentence now passed on Saul? Was it not hard to punish so little a sin with the loss of his kingdom?” Not to mention that no sin is little, because God, against whom all sin is committed, is a being of infinite majesty; and not to insist that what to men seems a small offence, to him, who knows the heart, may appear a heinous crime; this sin of Saul certainly can in no point of view be thought little, being an act of manifest disobedience to a known and express command of God; and disobedience to God, though in a small matter, is a great provocation. “Samuel expressly says, <span class="ital">Thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee. </span>What was this commandment? Why, not only to wait seven days till Samuel came to assist at the sacrifice, but to receive God’s direction, by the prophet, <span class="ital">what he should do, </span>or what measures he was to take upon the invasion of the Philistines, and not to act in so critical a conjuncture without his orders. Saul, under a pretence of piety, <span class="ital">and making supplication to the Lord, </span>absolutely contradicts the command, thinks himself above waiting for the prophet, takes upon himself the ordinance of an affair that no way belonged to him; and, as though God’s direction by the prophet was of no consequence to him, resolves to act for himself, and deal with the Philistines as well as he could. Let any inferior prince thus violate the orders of his sovereign, and act in any affair of importance directly contrary to his instructions and duty, and no one will scruple to pronounce him guilty of rebellion, or think he was too hardly treated by being removed from his dignity and government.” — Dodd and Chandler.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:8-14 Saul broke the order expressly given by Samuel, see ch.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast done foolishly ... - Motives of worldly expediency were not to be weighed against the express commandment of God.

Saul, Weary of Waiting for Samuel, Sacrifices.<p>9-14. Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings&#8212;Saul, though patriotic enough in his own way, was more ambitious of gaining the glory of a triumph to himself than ascribing it to God. He did not understand his proper position as king of Israel; and although aware of the restrictions under which he held the sovereignty, he wished to rule as an autocrat, who possessed absolute power both in civil and sacred things. This occasion was his first trial. Samuel waited till the last day of the seven, in order to put the constitutional character of the king to the test; and, as Saul, in his impatient and passionate haste knowingly transgressed (1Sa 13:12) by invading the priest's office and thus showing his unfitness for his high office (as he showed nothing of the faith of Gideon and other Hebrew generals), he incurred a threat of the rejection which his subsequent waywardness confirmed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hath sought, </span> i.e. hath found or discovered, as men do by seeking, an anthropopathy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A man after his own heart, </span> i.e. such a man as he desires, one who will fulfil all the desires of his heart, and not oppose them, as thou dost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hath commanded, </span> i.e. hath appointed or decreed, as the word <span class="ital">command</span> is sometimes used; for it was not yet actually done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> First, What was Saul’s sin? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> Either, first, That Saul invaded the priest’s office, and offered the sacrifice himself; which is not probable, both because he had priests with him, and among others an eminent one, Ahiah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm" title="And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.">1 Samuel 14:3</a></span>, and therefore had no occasion nor pretence for that presumption. Or rather, secondly, That Saul did not wait the full time for Samuel’s coming; for that is the thing which God commanded, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm" title="And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.">1 Samuel 10:8</a></span>, and the breach of this command is the only thing for which Saul makes an apology, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-11.htm" title="And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you came not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;">1 Samuel 13:11</a>,12</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> Secondly, Why did God so severely punish Saul for so small an offence, and that occasioned by great necessity, and done with an honest intention? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> First, Men are very incompetent judges of God’s judgments, because they see but very little, either of the majesty of the offended God, or of the heinous nature and aggravations of the offence. For instance, men see nothing but Saul’s outward act, which seems small; but God saw with how wicked a mind and heart he did this; with what rebellion against the light of his own conscience, as his own words imply; with what gross infidelity and distrust of God’s providence; with what contempt of God’s authority, and justice, and many other wicked principles and motions of his heart, unknown to men. Besides, God clearly saw all that wickedness that yet lay hid in his heart, and foresaw all his other crimes; and therefore had far more grounds for his sentence against him than we can imagine. Secondly, God doth sometimes punish small sins severely, and that for divers weighty reasons, as that all men may see what the least sin deserves, and how much they owe to God’s free and rich mercy for passing by their great offences; and what need they have not to indulge themselves in any small sin, as men are very prone to do, upon vain presumptions of God’s mercy, whereby they are easily and commonly drawn on to heinous crimes; and for many other reasons: so that some such instances of God’s severity are necessary discipline and caution to all mankind in the present and future ages; and therefore there is far more of mercy and kindness in such actions, than of rigour and harshness, since this is but particular to one person, and the other is a universal good. Thirdly, It must be remembered that the kingdom of Saul and of Israel was now in its infancy, and that this was the first command which he received from God. And it hath been ever held a piece of wisdom in all lawgivers, severely to punish the first violations of their laws, to secure their honour and obedience, and to affright and caution offenders for the future. And accordingly God dealt with Cain the first murderer; with Israel, for their first idolatry with the calf; with the first miscarriage of the priests, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm" title="And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.">Leviticus 10:1</a></span>; with the first profaner of the sabbath, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-35.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.">Numbers 15:35</a></span>; with the first gross hypocrites in the Christian church, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-5.htm" title="And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.">Acts 5:5</a>,10</span>. And therefore it is neither strange nor unjust if he deal with Saul after the same manner, and upon the same grounds. Fourthly, Though God threaten Saul with the loss of his kingdom for this sin, yet it is not improbable that there was a tacit condition implied, as is usual in such cases, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-4.htm" title="And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.">Jonah 3:4</a></span>, to wit, if he did not heartily repent of this and of all his sins; for the full, and final, and peremptory sentence of Saul’s rejection is plainly ascribed to another cause, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm" title="It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.">1 Samuel 15:11</a>,23,26,28,29</span>; and till that second offence neither the Spirit of the Lord departed from him, nor was David anointed in his stead, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.">1 Samuel 16:13</a>,14</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But now thy kingdom shall not continue,.... That is, in his family, nor in his tribe, but be removed to another: <p>the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart: who was David; though as yet Samuel knew him not, he knew by divine revelation that there was another one chosen, to whom the kingdom would be given; a man every way agreeable to the will of God, and who would fulfil his will, though he knew not particularly who he was: <p>and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people; that is, had appointed him to be king over Israel. God's decrees have the force of a law in them, and must be fulfilled; and cannot be resisted so as to be frustrated: <p>because thou hast not kept that which the Lord hath commanded thee; it matters not whether the thing commanded is greater or less, it is disobedience to the command that is the sin, and is resented: this might seem a small thing, since to offer the sacrifice was not criminal; but doing it before the time, a little before it should have been done, not waiting long enough for the prophet; yet it being against the command of God, or in neglect of it, it was sinful, and severely chastised; and the rather, that it might be an example to all succeeding kings how they offended, or broke the least of God's commandments; and this being the first king of Israel, he was made an example of to the rest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him <i>to be</i> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept <i>that</i> which the LORD commanded thee.</span><p>(k) That is, David.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">a man after his own heart</span>] Quoted by St Paul in his discourse at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-22.htm" title="And when he had removed him, he raised up to them David to be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, which shall fulfill all my will.">Acts 13:22</a>).

As David was but twenty-three years of age at Saul's death, he must now have been a mere child, even if he was born, (see ver. 1). But the Divine choice of Saul, which upon his obedience would that day have been confirmed, was now annulled, and the succession transferred elsewhere. Years might elapse before the first earthly step was taken to appoint his successor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>); nay, had Saul repented, we gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a> that he might have been forgiven: for God's threatenings, like his promises, are conditional. There is no fatalism in the Bible, but a loving discipline for man's recovery. But behind it stands the Divine foreknowledge and omnipotence; and so to the prophetic view Saul's refusal to repent, his repeated disobedience, and the succession of David were all revealed as accomplished facts.
