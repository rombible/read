It seems to have been something more than mere “Nature worship,” the devotion of the Phœnician settlers on the sea-board of Syria and Canaan to a marine deity. The constitution of Philistia was oligarchical: that is, the government was in the hands of a College of Princes, whose decision no individual could oppose. The princes (<span class= "ital">seranim</span>) are the heads of the several city districts, which formed a confederation, each one of the five chief cities holding a number of places, country cities, or “daughter” cities, as its special district. (See Erdmann in <span class= "ital">Lange’s Commentary.</span>) Dr. Payne Smith (Dean of Canterbury) has an ingenious and scholarly derivation for the titular designation of these lords (Hebrew, <span class= "ital">seranim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>in which, rejecting the usual root <span class= "ital">sar, </span>a prince, he connects the word with <span class= "ital">seren,</span> a hinge; “just,” he says, “as the cardinals of the Church of Rome take their name from <span class= "ital">cardo, </span>which has the same meaning.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-12 The hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Philistines; he not only convinced them of their folly, but severely chastised their insolence. Yet they would not renounce Dagon; and instead of seeking God's mercy, they desired to get clear of his ark. Carnal hearts, when they smart under the judgments of God, would rather, if it were possible, put him far from them, than enter into covenant or communion with him, and seek him for their friend. But their devices to escape the Divine judgments only increase them. Those that fight against God will soon have enough of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "lords" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>) were very unwilling to give up their triumph, and, with the common pagan superstition, imagined that some local bad luck was against them at Ashdod.

The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions make this to be the answer of the men of Gath, the one reading it,"and they of Gath said, let the ark of God come to us;''and the other,"they of Gath answered, let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about;''for they suspected, as Procopius Gazaeus observes, that the destruction did not come from God, but was a disease arising from some pestilential cause. They perhaps imagined it was in the air in and about Ashdod, or that though the situation of the ark was not liked, in another place it might be otherwise, and more agreeable: <p>and they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither; they seem not to carry it directly to the place, but carried it in a round about way, as if they had a mind to give it an airing, before they fixed it any where. <p>(x) Comment. in Hierem. c. 25. fol. 151.

Conder agree in the conclusion that it probably stood on the conspicuous hill now called <span class="ital">Tell-es-Sâfi</span>, 12 miles E. of Ashdod, at the foot of the mountains of Judah. “The position is one of immense strength, guarding the mouth of the valley of Elah.” Hence its importance as a border fortress, commanding one of the main approaches from Philistia to Judaea. It was captured by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm" title="Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>), fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm" title="And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>), taken by Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.">2 Kings 12:17</a>), retaken and dismantled by Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm" title="And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>).

They are called "seranim," from <span class="accented">seren</span>, "a hinge," just as the cardinals of the Church of Rome take their name from the Latin word <span class="accented">cardo</span>, which has the same meaning. There is no ground for connecting the word with <span class="accented">sar</span>, "a prince." When Ewald did so he probably forgot that the two words begin with different letters - seren with <span class="accented">samech</span>, and sar with <span class="accented">shin.</span> Seranim is the word constantly used of the lords of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5, 8</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-9.htm">1 Chronicles 12:9</a>), though after being correctly so styled in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2</a>, they are popularly called in vers. 3, 4, 9, <span class="accented">sarim</span>, "princes." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.</span> Unwilling to part with so signal a proof of their victory, the lords of the Philistines determine to remove the ark to another locality, but thereby only made the miraculous nature of what was taking place more evident to all. Of Gath but little is known; but Jerome describes it as still a large village in his days, and as situated near the border of Judaea, on the road from Eleutheropolis to Gaza. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Ark in the Land of the Philistines. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-6</a>. The Philistines carried the ark from Ebenezer, where they had captured it, into their capital, Ashdod (Esdud; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>), and placed it there in the temple of Dagon, by the side of the idol Dagon, evidently as a dedicatory offering to this god of theirs, by whose help they imagined that they had obtained the victory over both the Israelites and their God. With regard to the image of Dagon, compounded of man and fish, i.e., of a human body, with head and hands, and a fish's tail, see, in addition to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a>, Stark's Gaza, pp. 248ff., 308ff., and Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, pp. 466-7, where there is a bas-relief from Khorsabad, in which "a figure is seen swimming in the sea, with the upper part of the body resembling a bearded man, wearing the ordinary conical tiara of royalty, adorned with elephants' tusks, and the lower part resembling the body of a fish. It has the hand lifted up, as if in astonishment or fear, and is surrounded by fishes, crabs, and other marine animals" (Stark, p. 308). As this bas-relief represents, according to Layard, the war of an Assyrian king with the inhabitants of the coast of Syria, most probably of Sargon, who had to carry on a long conflict with the Philistian towns, more especially with Ashdod, there can hardly be any doubt that we have a representation of the Philistian Dagon here. This deity was a personification of the generative and vivifying principle of nature, for which the fish with its innumerable multiplication was specially adapted, and set forth the idea of the giver of all earthly good. </body></html>
