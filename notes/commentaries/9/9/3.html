His obedience to his father was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they were now at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Wherever we are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to get wisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to make them up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, in seeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how to secure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consulted and honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how to escape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people would rather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not their money, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it; but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value they put upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times, always to bring a present to those in authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The genealogy of Saul is here given as far as Aphiah ("Abiah," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-8.htm">1 Chronicles 7:8</a>), who was of the house of Becher the son of Benjamin <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>. "Kish" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35-39</a> was the son of "Ner" the son of "Jehiel," (or, "Abiel" here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>), the first settler ("father," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a>) at Gibeon, or Gibeah of Saul, and who married "Maachah," a daughter or granddaughter of Caleb. If so, it is obvious that the names of several generations are omitted between Kish and Abiel, and among them that from which the family of Matri <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-21.htm">1 Samuel 10:21</a> was called. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul &#8230; arise, go seek the asses&#8212;The probability is that the family of Kish, according to the immemorial usage of Oriental shepherds in the purely pastoral regions, had let the animals roam at large during the grazing season, at the close of which messengers were despatched in search of them. Such travelling searches are common; and, as each owner has his own stamp marked on his cattle, the mention of it to the shepherds he meets gradually leads to the discovery of the strayed animals. This ramble of Saul's had nothing extraordinary in it, except its superior directions and issue, which turned its uncertainty into certainty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which were there of great price and use, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a></span>, because of the scarcity of horses, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deu 17:16</a></span>, and therefore not held unworthy of Saul’s seeking, at least in those ancient times, when simplicity, humility, and industry were in fashion among persons of quality. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost,....

And it was quite agreeable to the simplicity of those times for persons of equal or greater substance to be employed in such an affair; asses made a considerable part of the wealth and riches of men, were rode upon by persons of quality, and were fed and taken care of by the sons of dukes and princes; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>.

As used for riding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>), the ass was valuable, and as these were probably kept for breeding, they were allowed more liberty than the males, and so strayed away. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With such a description of the "right of the king" as this, Samuel had pointed out to the elders the dangers connected with a monarchy in so alarming a manner, that they ought to have been brought to reflection, and to have desisted from their demand. "But the people refused to hearken to the voice of Samuel." They repeated their demand, "We will have a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and conduct our battles." </body></html>
