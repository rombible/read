At the moment of their meeting the seer has come forth from his house on the way to the solitary sacred heights of Ramah, the city of his residence, where he sacrifices on the altar to Jahveh, or is wont to partake of a sacred sacrificial repast with some of his closest friends. He at once desires to take Saul also with him, telling him beforehand how unimportant was the immediate object of his inquiries, and that the matter was already settled; but that for him and his whole house was reserved a very different and far better destiny in Israel. And though Saul, in his unassuming simplicity, would fain waive the honour which is obscurely hinted (so little does he yet know his better self), the holy man, more discerning, takes him with him to the sacrificial meal, which is already prepared; nay, assigns him the place of honour among the thirty guests before invited, while he is served with a portion of the sacrificial meat, put by, as it were, specially for him: for in like manner a portion other and higher than that of ordinary men had been long reserved for him by heaven.”—<span class= "ital">Ewald.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/9-14.htm" title="And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place....">1 Samuel 9:14-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, Samuel came out against them — </span>Met them directly in his way to the sacrifice.

They had heard of the sacrifice, and could tell of the necessity for Samuel's presence. It is no small benefit to live in religious and holy places. And we should always be ready to help those who are seeking after God's prophets. Though God had, in displeasure, granted Israel's request for a king, yet he sends them a man to be captain over them, to save them out of the hand of the Philistines. He does it, listening graciously to their cry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before he go up - By this phrase we see that the high place was in the highest part of the city.

The correct translation makes all clear. Saul and his servant ascend the hill. As they enter the city they meet Samuel “in the gate” (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-18.htm" title="Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.">1 Samuel 9:18</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Sept. reads “gate” here, and “city” in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-18.htm" title="Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.">1 Samuel 9:18</a></span>, but the change is unnecessary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The high place was either on the top of the hill on the slope of which the city stood, or on the adjacent hill from which the city had its name Ramathaim (“the two heights”). See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1 Samuel 1:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘<span class="ital">Against</span>’ here = ‘<span class="ital">opposite to</span>,’ as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-10.htm" title="And he took to him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.">Genesis 15:10</a>.

This agrees with what is said in ver. 18, that Saul and Samuel met in the  gateway. As Ramah occupied two hills, the Bamah would be on the summit of one, while the city probably nestled between them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Saul's objection, that they had no present to bring to the man of God, as the bread was gone from their vessels, was met by the servant with the remark, that he had a quarter of a shekel which he would give.</body></html>
