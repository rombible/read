The relation, however, between Samuel and the people must have been of a very close and friendly nature, else it would never have occurred, even to a simple countryman—as probably <span class= "ital">then </span>Saul’s servant was—to have sought the advice of one so great as Samuel in such a matter. It says, too, much for the old prophet’s kindly, unselfish disposition that his name was thus loved and honoured, even in the secluded farms of the Land of Promise.<p><span class= "bld">An honourable man.</span>—Better rendered, <span class= "ital">one held in honour.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm" title="And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he said comes surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.">1 Samuel 9:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">A man of God and an honourable man — </span>One of great reputation for his skill and faithfulness.

His obedience to his father was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they were now at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Wherever we are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to get wisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to make them up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, in seeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how to secure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consulted and honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how to escape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people would rather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not their money, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it; but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value they put upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times, always to bring a present to those in authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The land of Shalisha was somewhere near Gilgal, i. e., Jiljulieh.

That is, the servant of Saul: <p>behold, now, there is in this city a man of God; a prophet of the Lord, as the Targum; such were called men of God, because not only partakers of the grace of God, but of extraordinary gifts, which qualified them for the office of prophets. The city near to which they now were was Ramah, the place where Samuel lived, and he is the man of God here meant: <p>and he is an honourable man; of great esteem among men for his wisdom and knowledge, integrity and faithfulness, and particularly for his gift of prophecy, being a true prophet of the Lord; so the Targum,"and he is a man that prophesies truth,''and that made him honourable, and gave him great credit: <p>all that he saith cometh surely to pass; as his prophecies concerning Eli's family, and other things, which were well known to have had their accomplishment, and this had gained him universal esteem, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>, <p>now let us go thither; being very near it, within sight of it, insomuch that the servant could point at it, and say "this city", as in the preceding part of the verse: <p>peradventure he can show us our way that we should go; to find the asses; he was not certain he could or would, but thought it possible and probable he might. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">in this city</span>] Pointing to the town on a hill in front of them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a man of God</span>] See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-27.htm" title="And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?">1 Samuel 2:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he is an honourable man</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">the man is highly esteemed.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all that he saith</span>, &c.] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-19.htm" title="And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.">1 Samuel 3:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">peradventure</span>] Derived from <span class="ital">per</span>, “by,” and <span class="ital">adventura</span>, late Latin for “that which is about to happen,” “chance,” = “perchance,” “perhaps.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our way that we should go</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">our way upon which we have come</span>: i.e. shew us which way to go to attain the object of our journey.

But the days of Samuel’s greatest activity were long past, and he had for some time been living in comparative retirement: while “up to this point Saul had been only the shy and retiring youth of the family, employed in the common work of the farm,” and knowing little of the political or religious movements of the time.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this city.</span> Probably Ramathaim-zophim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Ramah, Samuel's dwelling place and property. Confessedly, however, Saul's route hither and thither in search of lost cattle is very obscure, and it is difficult to reconcile this identification with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, that Rachel's sepulchre lay on the route between this city and Gibeah of Saul. Nevertheless, Ramah was certainly in the land of Zuph, whence too it took its longer name (see on 1 Samuel 1:1); and it is remarkable that Jeremiah  (1 Samuel 31:15) describes Rachel's weeping as being heard in Ramah. It seems extraordinary that Saul should have known nothing of Israel's chief ruler, and that his servant was acquainted with him only in his lower capacity as a person to be consulted in private difficulties.

With this answer Samuel sent the men of Israel, i.e., the elders, away. This is implied in the words, "Go ye every man unto his city," since we may easily supply from the context, "till I shall call you again, to appoint you the king you desire." </body></html>
