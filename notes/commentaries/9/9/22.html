Samuel merely wished, in the first instance, to awaken new and grander thoughts and aspirations in this young heart, and without reply he proceeded to conduct his guests to the scene of the sacrifice on the high place. In the guest-chamber, where thirty of the most distinguished persons present at the solemn sacrifice were assembled. Samuel places Saul and his companion, no doubt to their great surprise, in the principal seats. “The parlour” is an unfortunate rendering of the Hebrew word here, which signifies the “cell,” or “chamber” attached to the building on the high place, for such purposes as the present. These solemn sacrificial meals were the usual adjuncts of a solemn sacrifice.<p>Not only was Saul thus highly honoured in public as the future king, but his servant also. If, as tradition tells us, this servant was Doeg the Edomite, he, too, on this occasion had a foretaste of his future position, an earnest of the rank and power which he would receive when one of Saul’s great officers of state.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-22.htm" title="And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the most chief place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.">1 Samuel 9:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the chiefest place — </span>Thereby to raise their expectation, and to prepare them for giving that honour to Saul which his approaching dignity required.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:18-27 Samuel, that good prophet, was so far from envying Saul, or bearing him any ill-will, that he was the first and most forward to do him honour. Both that evening and early the next morning, Samuel communed with Saul upon the flat roof of the house. We may suppose Samuel now convinced Saul that he was the person God had fixed upon for the government, and of his own willingness to resign. How different are the purposes of the Lord for us, from our intentions for ourselves! Perhaps Saul was the only one who ever went out to seek asses, and literally found a kingdom; but many have set out and moved their dwellings to seek riches and pleasures, who have been guided to places where they found salvation for their souls. Thus they have met with those who addressed them as if aware of the secrets of their lives and hearts, and have been led seriously to regard the word of the Lord. If this has been our case, though our worldly plans have not prospered, let us not care for that; the Lord has given us, or has prepared us for, what is far better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The parlour - The "hall" or "cell" attached to the chapel on the high place, in which the sacrificial feast was accustomed to be held.

The guests were placed by the master of the feast according to their rank; and the dignity of the person, as Jarchi observes, was known by his manners and place of sitting: <p>which were about thirty persons; more or less; Josephus (n) says seventy, disagreeing with the text, the Targum, Syriac and Arabic versions, but agreeing with the Septuagint. <p>(n) Antiqu. l. 6. c. 4. sect. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which <i>were</i> about thirty persons.</span><p>(m) Where the feast was.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">the parlour</span>] Or, <span class="bld">the chamber</span>, a room at the high place specially used for sacrificial feasts.

Strictly the cell or room attached to the chapel of the high place, now used as the <span class="accented">guest chamber</span>, wherein the thirty chief men, who came as invited guests, were to dine. The rest of the people would be in the open air. There Samuel not only placed Saul in the seat of honour, but also his servant, as representing the king's officers of state, and commanded the cook to set before him a <span class="cmt_word">portion</span> that had been reserved. This was the shoulder; but whether it was the left shoulder, of which the laity might eat, or the right shoulder, which was sacred, as belonging to the priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>), is not mentioned. If the latter, it was Samuel s own share, and he may by his prophetic authority have assigned it to Saul, in token that the priesthood would be subject to the royal power. Be this, however, as it may, it was the portion of honour, and it seems that Samuel, on receiving intimation the previous day of Saul's visit (ver. 6), had given orders  that it should be carefully reserved for him (ver. 24). He now orders it to be set before Saul, with that <span class="cmt_word">which was upon it,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the flesh and the fat not appointed to be burnt upon the altar. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they went into the town, Samuel met them on his way out to go to the high place of sacrifice. Before the meeting itself is described, the statement is introduced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-15.htm">1 Samuel 9:15-17</a>, that the day before Jehovah had foretold to Samuel that the man was coming to him whom he was to anoint as captain over his people. &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, to open any one's ear, equivalent to reveal something to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-27.htm">2 Samuel 7:27</a>, etc.). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, I will send thee, i.e., "I will so direct his way in my overruling providence, that he shall come to thee" (J. H. Mich. ). The words, "that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, for their cry is come unto me," are not at all at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>. In that passage there is simply the assertion, that there was no more any permanent oppression on the part of the Philistines in the days of Samuel, such as had taken place before; but an attempt to recover their supremacy over Israel is not only not precluded, but is even indirectly affirmed (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>). The words before us simply show that the Philistines had then begun to make a fresh attempt to contend for dominion over the Israelites. "I have looked upon my people:" this is to be explained like the similar passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-25.htm">Exodus 2:25</a>, "God looked upon the children of Israel," and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, "I have looked upon the misery of my people." God's looking was not a quiet, inactive looking on, but an energetic look, which brought help in trouble. "Their cry is come unto me:" this is word for word the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-9.htm">Exodus 3:9</a>. As the Philistines wanted to tread in the footsteps of the Egyptians, it was necessary that Jehovah should also send His people a deliverer from these new oppressors, by giving them a king. The reason here assigned for the establishment of a monarchy is by no means at variance with the displeasure which God had expressed to Samuel at the desire of the people for a king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>.); since this displeasure had reference to the state of heart from which the desire had sprung. </body></html>
