And we should always be ready to help those who are seeking after God's prophets.

It is possible that the aggressive movements of the Philistines, after the long cessation indicated by <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>, coupled with Samuel's old age and consequent inability to lead them to victory as before, were among the chief causes which led to the cry for a king.

The future king of Israel was to fight the battles of the Lord and protect His people.
