They had heard of the sacrifice, and could tell of the necessity for Samuel's presence. It is no small benefit to live in religious and holy places. And we should always be ready to help those who are seeking after God's prophets. Though God had, in displeasure, granted Israel's request for a king, yet he sends them a man to be captain over them, to save them out of the hand of the Philistines. He does it, listening graciously to their cry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is manifestly a gloss inserted in the older narrative by the later editor of the sacred text, to explain the use of the term in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-11.htm">1 Samuel 9:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-18.htm">1 Samuel 9:18-19</a>.

From these damsels they learned that the day was devoted to a festival occasion, in honor of which Samuel had arrived in the city; that a sacrifice had been offered, which was done by prophets in extraordinary circumstances at a distance from the tabernacle, and that a feast was to follow&#8212;implying that it had been a peace offering; and that, according to the venerable practice of the Israelites, the man of God was expected to ask a special blessing on the food in a manner becoming the high occasion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Going out, </span> i.e. out of the city, and down to the bottom of the hill, where the fountain or river was. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as they went up the hill to the city,....

From <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2</a> we learn that Samuel went occasionally even to distant places to perform priestly duties. <span class="cmt_word">In the high place.</span> Hebrew, Bamah. Samuel, we read, had built an altar at Ramah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>), and probably the present sacrifice was to be offered upon it. Such altars, and the worship of the true God upon high places, were at this time recognised as right, and were, in fact, in accordance with, and were even the remains of, the old patriarchal religion. But gradually they were condemned, partly because of the glowing sanctity of the temple, but chiefly because of the tendency of religious rites celebrated in such places to degenerate into nature-worship, and orgies such as the heathen were in the habit of holding on the tops of mountains and hills. We thus find in the Bible an illustration of the principle that rites and ceremonies (as not being of the essentials of religion) may be changed, or even abolished, if they are abused, or lead on to evil consequences. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Having been sent out by his father to search for his she-asses which had strayed, Saul went with his servant through the mountains of Ephraim, which ran southwards into the tribe-territory of Benjamin (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), then through the land of Shalishah and the land of Shaalim, and after that through the land of Benjamin, without finding the asses; and at length, when he had reached the land of Zuph, he determined to return, because he was afraid that his father might turn his mind from the asses, and trouble himself about them (the son and servant). &#1502;&#1503; &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;, to desist from a thing, to give it up or renounce it.<p>As Saul started in any case from Gibeah of Benjamin, his own home (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-34.htm">1 Samuel 15:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-1.htm">1 Samuel 26:1</a>), i.e., the present Tuleil el Phul, which was an hour or an hour and a half to the north of Jerusalem (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>), and went thence into the mountains of Ephraim, he no doubt took a north-westerly direction, so that he crossed the boundary of Benjamin somewhere between Bireh and Atarah, and passing through the crest of the mountains of Ephraim, on the west of Gophnah (Jifna), came out into the land of Shalishah. Shalishah is unquestionably the country round (or of) Baal-shalishah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a>), which was situated, according to Eusebius (Onom. s.v. &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;: Beth-sarisa or Beth-salisa), in regione Thamnitica, fifteen Roman miles to the north of Diospolis (Lydda), and was therefore probably the country to the west of Jiljilia, where three different wadys run into one large wady, called Kurawa; and according to the probable conjecture of Thenius, it was from this fact that the district received the name of Shalishah, or Three-land. They proceeded thence in their search to the land of Shaalim: according to the Onom. (s.v.), "a village seven miles off, in finibus Eleutheropoleos contra occidentem." But this is hardly correct, and is most likely connected with the mistake made in transposing the town of Samuel to the neighbourhood of Diospolis (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>). For since they went on from Shaalim into the land of Benjamin, and then still further into the land of Zuph, on the south-west of Benjamin, they probably turned eastwards from Shalishah, into the country where we find Beni Mussah and Beni Salem marked upon Robinson's and v. de Velde's maps, and where we must therefore look for the land of Shaalim, that they might proceed thence to explore the land of Benjamin from the north-east to the south-west. If, on the contrary, they had gone from Shaalim in a southerly or south-westerly direction, to the district of Eleutheropolis, they would only have entered the land of Benjamin at the south-west corner, and would have had to go all the way back again in order to go thence to the land of Zuph. For we may infer with certainty that the land of Zuph was on the south-west of the tribe-territory of Benjamin, from the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, Saul and his companion passed Rachel's tomb on their return thence to their own home, and then came to the border of Benjamin. On the name Zuph, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>.</body></html>
