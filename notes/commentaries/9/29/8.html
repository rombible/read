The generous confidence of the chivalrous Achish is here in painful contrast with the dissimulation of the Israelite chieftain, David.<p>It has been suggested that these suspicions of his loyalty on the part of the Philistine leaders had been aroused by David deliberately, in order to bring about his dismissal from the army in the field. This is possible, for the situation in which David now finds himself was most embarrassing from every point of view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-8.htm" title="And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you to this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?">1 Samuel 29:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">David said, But what have I done? — </span>This was deep dissimulation and flattery in David, no way to be justified. But who, that has not experienced it, can know how strong a temptation they who attend on great men are under to compliment them and dissemble. David, no doubt, heartily rejoiced at this dismission; but as he did not know how much longer he might be obliged to stay in the land of the Philistines, he seems to have yielded to a temptation that prudence required him to carry it fair toward them, and to pretend to have that concern upon this occasion which he certainly did not feel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:6-11 David scarcely ever had a greater deliverance than when dismissed from such insnaring service.

But David is not free from censure in his professions to Achish (1Sa 29:8), to do what he probably had not the smallest purpose of doing&#8212;of fighting with Achish against his enemies. It is just an instance of the unhappy consequences into which a false step&#8212;a departure from the straight course of duty&#8212;will betray everyone who commits it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This was deep dissimulation and flattery; but he apprehended it necessary, lest he should tacitly confess himself guilty of that whereof they accused him, and thereby expose himself to the utmost hazards. These perplexities he brought himself into by his irregular course, in forsaking the land of Judah, where God had placed him, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-5.htm" title="And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah.

This question is anticipated by the speech of Achish, who had declared he had found no evil in him; but David must say something to put on an appearance of concern for being dismissed, when he was heartily glad of it: <p>and what hast thou found in thy servant, so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? which cannot be excused of great dissimulation, since nothing was more foreign from his heart, and against his will, than fighting against the Israelites, and which he determined to avoid if possible; and glad at heart he was to be thus excused, and freed from the straits and difficulties he was involved in; but that the Philistines might have no cause of suspicion of him, and that he was warmly attached to their interest among whom he was still to continue, he put on these airs. Abarbinel is of opinion that the lords of the Philistines were only afraid of David, but not of his men, and therefore were not solicitous about their going, but his, which gave David a concern; and since he was particularly singled out, he desired to know what special evil had been found in him; but when he understood, by the following answer of Achish, that his servants were to go with him, he was content, and said no more; but the princes asked, "what do these Hebrews here?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-3.htm">1 Samuel 29:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</span><p>(e) This deception cannot be excused, for it grieved him to go against the people of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">And David said</span>, &c.] A hypocritical answer, designed to confirm Achish in the belief of his fidelity.

But truth is a modern virtue, and though David extols it in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>), we too often find him practising falsehood. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the princes of the Philistines (sarne, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>) advanced by hundreds and thousands (i.e., arranged in companies of hundreds and thousands), and David and his men came behind with Achish (i.e., forming the rear-guard), the (other) princes pronounced against their allowing David and his men to go with them.
