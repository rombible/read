The casual mention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:">1Samuel 17:34</a>) of the boy’s prowess, when the lion and the bear attacked his father’s flock, tells us that the boyhood and youth of David had been no ordinary one, and Eliab’s jealous disposition had been, doubtless, often aroused. Probably, too, the envious elder brother well remembered the visit of the great seer to Bethlehem, and how Samuel had, for some mysterious, and as yet unknown, reason, anointed this young brother of his, and had chosen him to be his pupil and companion. Was he now come with power unknown to him (Eliab) to perform some startling deed of daring?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-28.htm" title="And Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why came you down here? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?

In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why camest thou down? - From the heights of Bethlehem to the valley of Elah.<p>Thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart - See the similar expression, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49.htm">Jeremiah 49</a>.

David’s advancement seems to have roused Eliab’s jealousy. He imputes the worst motives to him and taunts him with (1) neglect of duty; (2) arrogance and discontent with his humble occupation; (3) unseemly eagerness for the sight of bloodshed. Eliab was unable to enter into the nature of David’s lofty indignation. Compare the hatred of Joseph’s brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-4.htm" title="And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.">Genesis 37:4</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eliab's anger was kindled against David.</span> As David, with growing indignation at an uncovenanted heathen thus dishonouring the subjects of the living God, puts eager questions to all around, his ehier brother angrily reproaches him with words full of contempt. Between the eldest and youngest of eight sons was a vast interval, and Eliab regards David's talk as mere <span class="cmt_word">pride</span>, or, rather, "presumption," "impertinence;" and also as <span class="cmt_word">naughtiness</span>, or badness, <span class="cmt_word">of heart</span>, probably because he imagined that David's object was to provoke some one else to fight, that he might <span class="cmt_word">see the battle.</span> David's answer is gentle and forbearing, but the last words are difficult. <span class="cmt_word">Is there not a cause?</span> Have not those whom we are ready to condemn a reason and justification for their conduct?
