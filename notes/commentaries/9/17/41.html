The article before &#1488;&#1512;&#1497; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; points out these animals as the well-known beasts of prey. By the expression &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; the bear is subordinated to the lion, or rather placed afterwards, as something which came in addition to it; so that &#1488;&#1514; is to be taken as a nota accus. (vid., Ewald, 277, a), though it is not to be understood as implying that the lion and the bear went together in search of prey. The subordination or addition is merely a logical one: not only the lion, but also the bear, which seized the sheep, did David slay. &#1494;&#1492;, which we find in most of the editions since the time of Jac. Chayim, 1525, is an error in writing, or more correctly in hearing, for &#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, a sheep. "And I went out after it; and when it rose up against me, I seized it by its beard, and smote it, and killed it." &#1494;&#1511;&#1503;, beard and chin, signifies the bearded chin. Thenius proposes, though without any necessity, to alter &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1493; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, for the simple but weak reason, that neither lions nor bears have any actual beard. We have only to think, for example, of the &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; in Homer (Il. xv. 275, xvii. 109), or the barbam vellere mortuo leoni of Martial (x. 9). Even in modern times we read of lions having been killed by Arabs with a stick (see Rosenmller, Bibl. Althk. iv. 2, pp. 132-3). The constant use of the singular suffix is sufficient to show, that when David speaks of the lion and the bear, he connects together two different events, which took place at different times, and then proceeds to state how he smote both the one and the other of the two beasts of prey.</body></html>
