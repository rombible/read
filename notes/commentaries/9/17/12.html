This omission was, no doubt, owing to the difficulty connected with this mention of David, where he is apparently introduced for the first time into the history; the LXX. translation not un-frequently adding or subtracting from the text when anything met them which they could not readily understand. The passage, as we find it, is undoubtedly genuine; the probable explanation of what puzzled the LXX. is given below.<p>It is, however, better (with the Syriac Version) to place all the words after “Beth-lehem-judah” down to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-14.htm" title="And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.">1Samuel 17:14</a> in a parenthesis. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-15.htm" title="But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.">1Samuel 17:15</a>, after the parenthesis descriptive of Jesse and his three elder sons, takes up the account of David again, thus: “But David went,” &c.<p><span class= "bld">Went among men for an old man.</span>—This rendering follows the translation of Jerome’s Vulgate, “Senex et grandævus inter viros,” rather than the Hebrew. The literal translation of <span class= "ital">ba-baănashim </span>would be <span class= "ital">went among men. </span>It is best to assume that the verb <span class= "ital">ba- </span>here is used elliptically for <span class= "ital">ba-bayamin, </span>“was advanced in days,” that is, “was an old man.” Keil renders <span class= "ital">baanashim </span>“among the weak,” that is, “Jesse had come to be reckoned among the weak” (or the aged). Maurer and others believe the present Hebrew reading corrupt; the sense, however, is clear.<p>Jesse is represented in this parenthesis, descriptive of the father of David, for some reason known only to the compiler, as already an old man. Possibly this notice is inserted to explain the reason why the father of the future hero-king of Israel was not among the warriors of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-12.htm" title="Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul....">1 Samuel 17:12-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">David was the son of that Ephrathite, </span>&c. — Being chosen of God to combat with Goliath, we are here informed of whom he was descended. <span class="ital">The man went among men — </span>Was accounted; <span class="ital">an old man — </span>Therefore he went not himself to the camp. <span class="ital">David was the youngest — </span>Being young, he was not put to the hardships of war; but the three eldest undertook to serve their prince and their country in this time of common danger. <span class="ital">David went and returned from Saul — </span>Left his court, with his permission, for the present.

In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This and the following verses down to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-31.htm">1 Samuel 17:31</a> are omitted in the Vatican copy of the Septuagint, as are <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55-58</a>.

Isaiah, with which agrees the Targum; or whenever he went abroad, he was attended by many men, had a large retinue, which sense Abarbinel mentions, and is that of Ben Gersom, and agrees with the Talmud (t); but the Syriac and Arabic versions read "stricken in years", which seems most agreeable. <p>(t) T.

Some explain this as meaning "placed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "reckoned among men of rank;" but probably an aleph has dropped out in the word rendered men, and we should read <span class="accented">"gone," i.e.</span> "advanced in years."

Some grammarians consider that this repetition of the verb is intended to give it the force of a pluperfect, - they had gone,-but it is more probably an error, and one of the two verbs should be omitted. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And "greaves of brass upon his feet, and a brazen lance (hung) between his shoulders," i.e., upon his back. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; signifies a lance, or small spear. The lxx and Vulgate, however, adopt the rendering &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;, clypeus aeneus; and Luther has followed them, and translates it a brazen shield. Thenius therefore proposes to alter &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; into &#1502;&#1490;&#1503;, because the expression "between his shoulders" does not appear applicable to a spear or javelin, which Goliath must have suspended by a strap, but only to a small shield slung over his back, whilst his armour-bearer carried the larger &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; in front of him. But the difficulty founded upon the expression "between his shoulders" has been fully met by Bochart (Hieroz. i. 2, c. 8), in the examples which he cites from Homer, Virgil, etc., to prove that the ancients carried their own swords slung over their shoulders (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4; &#787; &#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;: Il. ii. 45, etc.). And Josephus understood the expression in this way (Ant. vi. 9, 1). Goliath had no need of any shield to cover his back, as this was sufficiently protected by the coat of mail. Moreover, the allusion to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a> points to an offensive weapon, and not to a shield.</body></html>
