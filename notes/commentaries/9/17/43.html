This kind of abusive dialogue is common among the Arab combatants still. David's speech, however, presents a striking contrast to the usual strain of these invectives. It was full of pious trust, and to God he ascribed all the glory of the triumph he anticipated.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With staves, </span> i.e. with a staff; the plural number for the singular; as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-7.htm" title="And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.">Genesis 21:7</a> 46:7</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Philistine cursed David; </span> he prayed that his god Dagon, and Ashtaroth, &c., would destroy him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Philistine said unto David, am I a dog?....

"And," he continued (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>), "the Lord who delivered me out of the hand (the power) of the lion and the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine." David's courage rested, therefore, upon his confident belief that the living God would not let His people be defied by the heathen with impunity. Saul then desired for him the help of the Lord in carrying out his resolution, and bade him put on his own armour-clothes, and bird on his armour. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (his clothes) signifies probably a peculiar kind of clothes which were worn under the armour, a kind of armour-coat to which the sword was fastened.</body></html>
