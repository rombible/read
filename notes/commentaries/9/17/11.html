Where was Jonathan, for instance, ever the bravest of the brave, and his gallant armour-bearer? There had assuredly been a time when neither motives of dignity nor prudence would have restrained Saul and his warriors from accepting the challenge of the uncircumcised enemy. We notice, too, here there is no inquiry of the Urim and Thummim, no mention of prayer to the God of the armies of Israel. An evil spirit was indeed upon the King of Israel.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-11 Men so entirely depend upon God in all things, that when he withdraws his help, the most valiant and resolute cannot find their hearts or hands, as daily experience shows.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Spear's-head - literally, "the flame of his spear," the metal part which flashed like a flame.<p>Six hundred shekels - i. e., between seventeen and eighteen pounds avoirdupois. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-11. I defy the armies of Israel &#8230;; give me a man, that we may fight together&#8212;In cases of single combat, a warrior used to go out in front of his party, and advancing towards the opposite ranks, challenge someone to fight with him. If his formidable appearance, or great reputation for physical strength and heroism, deterred any from accepting the challenge, he used to parade himself within hearing of the enemy's lines, specify in a loud, boastful, bravado style, defying them, and pouring out torrents of abuse and insolence to provoke their resentment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which may seem strange, considering the glorious promises, and their late experiences of Divine assistance.

For they were delivered with such a tone and strength of voice, as to be heard very generally, at least by many, and which soon was reported through the whole army: <p>they were dismayed, and greatly afraid; which may seem strange, when there were so many valiant men among them, as Saul himself, who had behaved with so much courage against the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites; but now the Spirit of God was departed from him, and he was become timorous and fearful; and though he was much better than he had been, yet still he was not the man of spirit and resolution as before: there was also Abner, the general of his army, a very valiant man, a great man in Israel, and yet appears not on this occasion; and, what is more wonderful, Jonathan the son of Saul was present, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1</a> who had not only smitten a garrison of the Philistines, but with one man more only had attacked another garrison, and routed the whole army of the Philistines, and yet now shows not his head against a single man: so it is when God cuts off the spirits of princes, or takes away their courage; victory over this man, and the glory of it, were reserved for David; and all this fear and dread throughout the armies of Israel were suffered, that he might appear the more glorious. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And the (well-known) champion came out of the camps of the Philistines (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the middle-man, who decides a war between two armies by a single combat; Luther, "the giant," according to the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; of the lxx, although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-23.htm">1 Samuel 17:23</a> the Septuagint translators have rendered the word correctly &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which is probably only another form of &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), named Goliath of Gath, one of the chief cities of the Philistines, where there were Anakim still left, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a>. His height was six cubits and a span (6 1/4 cubits), i.e., according to the calculation made by Thenius, about nine feet two inches Parisian measure, - a great height no doubt, though not altogether unparalleled, and hardly greater than that of the great uncle of Iren, who came to Berlin in the year 1857 (see Pentateuch, p. 869, note).<p>(Note: According to Pliny (h. n. vii. 16), the giant Pusio and the giantess Secundilla, who lived in the time of Augustus, were ten feet three inches (Roman) in height; and a Jew is mentioned by Josephus (Ant. xviii. 4, 5), who was seven cubits in height, i.e., ten Parisian feet, or if the cubits are Roman, nine and a half.)<p>The armour of Goliath corresponded to his gigantic stature: "a helmet of brass upon his head, and clothes in scale armour, the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass." The meaning scales is sustained by the words &#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-9.htm">Leviticus 11:9-10</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-9.htm">Deuteronomy 14:9-10</a>, and &#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>. &#1511;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, therefore, is not &#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (lxx), a coat of mail made of rings worked together like chains, such as were used in the army of the Seleucidae (1 Macc. 6:35), but according to Aquila's &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (scaled), a coat made of plates of brass lying one upon another like scales, such as we find upon the old Assyrian sculptures, where the warriors fighting in chariots, and in attendance upon the king, wear coats of scale armour, descending either to the knees or ankles, and consisting of scales of iron or brass, which were probably fastened to a shirt of felt or coarse linen (see Layard, Nineveh and its Remains, vol. ii. p. 335). The account of the weight, 5000 shekels, i.e., according to Thenius, 148 Dresden pounds, is hardly founded upon the actual weighing of the coat of mail, but probably rested upon a general estimate, which may have been somewhat too high, although we must bear in mind that the coat of mail not only covered the chest and back, but, as in the case of the Assyrian warriors, the lower part of the body also, and therefore must have been very large and very heavy.<p>(Note: According to Thenius, the cuirass of Augustus the Strong, which has been preserved in the historical museum at Dresden, weighted fifty-five pounds; and from that he infers, that the weight given as that of Goliath's coat of mail is by no means too great. Ewald, on the other hand, seems to have no idea of the nature of the Hebrew eights, or of the bodily strength of a man, since he gives 5000 lbs. of brass as the weight of Goliath's coat of mail (Gesch. iii. p. 90), and merely observes that the pounds were of course much smaller than ours. But the shekel did not even weight so much as our full ounce. With such statements as these you may easily turn the historical character of the scriptural narrative into incredible myths; but they cannot lay any claim to the name of science.) </body></html>
