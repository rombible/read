In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David went ... - "Was gone," referring to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-19.htm">1 Samuel 16:19-20</a>.

This verse takes up the narrative, disturbed by the inserted explanation about David's family relations. The extraordinary formation of the ground, as described in ver. 3, shows how it was possible for this challenge to go on for forty days without either army advancing or retiring. During this long time it seems to have been the business of the friends at home to supply the combatants with food, and so Jesse sends David with <span class="cmt_word">an ephah</span>, about three pecks, <span class="cmt_word">of parched corn</span> - as the word is spelt in the Hebrew it means "parched pease." Also <span class="cmt_word">ten loaves,</span> and, for the captain of their thousand, <span class="cmt_word">ten cheeses</span> - rather, "ten slices of fresh curd." David was also <span class="cmt_word">to take their pledge</span>.
