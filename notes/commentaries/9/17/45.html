This kind of abusive dialogue is common among the Arab combatants still. David's speech, however, presents a striking contrast to the usual strain of these invectives. It was full of pious trust, and to God he ascribed all the glory of the triumph he anticipated.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the name of the Lord of hosts, </span> i.e. by a commission from him, with confidence in him, and assurance of his help, and for the vindication of his honour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whom thou hast defied, </span> in defying that army and people whereof he is the Lord and Protector. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said David to the Philistine,....

He therefore said to Saul, "I cannot go in these things, for I have not tried them;" and having taken them off, he took his shepherd's staff in his hand, sought out five smooth stones from the brook-valley, and put them in the shepherd's thing that he had, namely his shepherd's bag. He then took the sling in his hand, and went up to the Philistine. In the exercise of his shepherd's calling he may have become so skilled in the use of the sling, that, like the Benjaminites mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>, he could sling at a hair's-breadth, and not miss.</body></html>
