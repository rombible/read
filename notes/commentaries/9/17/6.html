The historian then adds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>): "When the (evil) spirit of God came to Saul (&#1488;&#1500;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-9.htm">1 Samuel 19:9</a>, is really equivalent to &#1506;&#1500;), and David took the harp and played, there came refreshing to Saul, and he became well, and the evil spirit departed from him." Thus David came to Saul's court, and that as his benefactor, without Saul having any suspicion of David's divine election to be king of Israel. This guidance on the part of God was a school of preparation to David for his future calling. In the first place, he was thereby lifted out of his quiet and homely calling in the country into the higher sphere of court-life; and thus an opportunity was afforded him not only for intercourse with men of high rank, and to become acquainted with the affairs of the kingdom, but also to display those superior gifts of his intellect and heart with which God had endowed him, and thereby to gain the love and confidence of the people. But at the same time he was also brought into a severe school of affliction, in which his inner man was to be trained by conflicts from without and within, so that he might become a man after God's heart, who should be well fitted to found the true monarchy in Israel. </body></html>
