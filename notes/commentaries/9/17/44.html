This kind of abusive dialogue is common among the Arab combatants still. David's speech, however, presents a striking contrast to the usual strain of these invectives.

He seems to have stood still, disdaining: to take another step towards such a pitiful combatant, and therefore bids him come up to him, and he would soon dispatch him; unless he said this, because David was light and nimble, and he heavy and unwieldy because of his bigness, and the burden of armour on him, and therefore could not make such haste as he wished to destroy his adversary, of which he made no doubt: <p>and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field; the wild beasts he means; though Jarchi thinks he spoke improperly, since it is not the way of the beasts of the field, as sheep, oxen, &amp;c. to devour a man, or even to eat any flesh; and therefore he observes, when David comes, he uses another word, which signifies the wild beasts of the earth, and so we render it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>; but Kimchi shows that even these are comprehended in the word here used, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-6.htm">Isaiah 18:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">44</span>. <span class="ital">I will give thy flesh</span>, &c.] Compare Hector’s defiance of Ajax in Hom. <span class="ital">Il.</span> XIII. 831:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The flesh<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Shall glut the dogs and carrion birds of Troy.”<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear; and the Philistine, this uncircumcised one, shall become like one of them (i.e., the same thing shall happen to him as to the lion and the bear), because he has defied the ranks of the living God."

David's courage rested, therefore, upon his confident belief that the living God would not let His people be defied by the heathen with impunity. Saul then desired for him the help of the Lord in carrying out his resolution, and bade him put on his own armour-clothes, and bird on his armour. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (his clothes) signifies probably a peculiar kind of clothes which were worn under the armour, a kind of armour-coat to which the sword was fastened.</body></html>
