So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/44-6.htm" title="For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.">Psalm 44:6-8</a> we read—<p>“I will not trust in my bow,<p>Neither shall my sword save me.<p>In God we boast all the day long,<p>And praise thy Name for ever.”<p>And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/33-16.htm" title="There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.">Psalm 33:16-20</a>,<p>“There is no king saved by the multitude of an host,<p>A mighty man is not delivered by much strength.”<p>* * * * *<p>“Our soul waiteth for the Lord,<p>He is our help and our shield.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm" title="And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.">1 Samuel 17:47</a></span>. <span class="ital">Saveth not with sword and spear — </span>That is, that he can save without these arms, and with the most contemptible weapons, and that he needs not human force to effect his designs. <span class="ital">For the battle is the Lord’s — </span>The events of war are wholly in his power. <span class="ital">And he will give you into our hands — </span>David speaks thus confidently, because he was assured of success, by particular inspiration. How great is the difference between the speech of Goliath and that of David! The former consists of the vain- glorious boasting words of a man proudly confiding in his own strength, and thinking of nothing but his own glory. The words of the latter, although expressing an equal assurance of victory, are humble and modest, attributing nothing to himself, but all to the power and goodness of God; building his hopes upon, and rejoicing in, the honour that would accrue to God from his success, instead of puffing himself up with the glory that would arise to himself therefrom.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:40-47 The security and presumption of fools destroy them. Nothing can excel the humility, faith, and piety which appear in David's words. He expressed his assured expectation of success; he gloried in his mean appearance and arms, that the victory might be ascribed to the Lord alone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord saveth not with sword ... - Observe the consistent teaching of such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-4.htm">Judges 7:4</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6</a>, etc., and their practical use to the Church as lessons of trust in God, and distrust of ourselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42-47. the Philistine said &#8230; said David to the Philistine&#8212;When the two champions met, they generally made each of them a speech, and sometimes recited some verses, filled with allusions and epithets of the most opprobrious kind, hurling contempt and defiance at one another. This kind of abusive dialogue is common among the Arab combatants still. David's speech, however, presents a striking contrast to the usual strain of these invectives.
