Greek Version here reads, “your best oxen,” which required only the change of one letter of similar sound in the Hebrew word here. This was, no doubt,. the reading of the original text, as the young men seem included among the sons in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.">1Samuel 8:11-12</a>, and oxen would naturally precede the asses mentioned in the next clause of this verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/8-16.htm" title="And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your best young men, and your asses, and put them to his work....">1 Samuel 8:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">He will take your men-servants — </span>By constraint, and without sufficient recompense. <span class="ital">Your goodliest young men — </span>The most beautiful and proper person she can find; <span class="ital">and your asses, and put them to his work — </span>Either at the plough, or for carriage, or any other employment wherein he shall think they will be useful. <span class="ital">And ye shall be his servants — </span>So subject to him, that if he please ye shall be no better than slaves, deprived of that liberty which you now enjoy. <span class="ital">And ye shall cry out in that day — </span>Ye shall bitterly mourn for the sad effects of this inordinate desire of a king. This shows that in the foregoing verses Samuel describes the uncontrollable power which the eastern princes exercised over their subjects, who were obliged patiently to bear whatever their kings imposed upon them, without any power to help themselves. <span class="ital">The Lord will not hear you in that day — </span>Because you will not hear nor obey his counsel in <span class="ital">this day; </span>but he will leave you under this heavy yoke.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:10-22 If they would have a king to rule them, as the eastern kings ruled their subjects, they would find the yoke exceedingly heavy. Those that submit to the government of the world and the flesh, are told plainly, what hard masters they are, and what tyranny the dominion of sin is. The law of God and the manner of men widely differ from each other; the former should be our rule in the several relations of life; the latter should be the measure of our expectations from others. These would be their grievances, and, when they complained to God, he would not hear them. When we bring ourselves into distress by our own wrong desires and projects, we justly forfeit the comfort of prayer, and the benefit of Divine aid. The people were obstinate and urgent in their demand. Sudden resolves and hasty desires make work for long and leisurely repentance. Our wisdom is, to be thankful for the advantages, and patient under the disadvantages of the government we may live under; and to pray continually for our rulers, that they may govern us in the fear of God, and that we may live under them in all godliness and honesty. And it is a hopeful symptom when our desires of worldly objects can brook delay; and when we can refer the time and manner of their being granted to God's providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See illustrations in marginal references; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-18. he will take your fields, &c.&#8212;The circumstances mentioned here might be illustrated by exact analogies in the conduct of many Oriental monarchs in the present day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By constraint, and without sufficient recompense <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he will take your manservants, and your maidservants,....

Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He will...  put them to his work.</span> Again the hateful forced service, but here not, as in ver. 12, of themselves, but of their households. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">your goodliest young men</span> the Septuagint reads, "your best <span class="accented">oxen</span>," which requires only the change of one letter, and is in agreement with the rest of the verse. Samuel would scarcely place their choicest young men between the female slaves and the asses. But while the ass was used chiefly for riding, the ox was, as he still continues to be upon the Continent, man's most faithful and valued friend and fellow labourer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In accordance with the instructions of God, Samuel told the people all the words of Jehovah, i.e., all that God had said to him, as related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7-9</a>, and then proclaimed to them the right of the king.</body></html>
