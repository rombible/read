It drove him to his knees. When any thing disturbs us, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to show our trouble before God. Samuel is to tell them that they shall have a king. Not that God was pleased with their request, but as sometimes he opposes us from loving-kindness, so at other times he gratifies us in wrath; he did so here. God knows how to bring glory to himself, and serves his own wise purposes, even by men's foolish counsels.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin which implies that the thing spoken of caused anger, indignation, or some revulsion of feeling (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm">Genesis 21:11-12</a>). The answer of the Lord <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a> shows that Samuel's personal feelings had been hurt. They were soothed by being reminded of the continued ingratitude of the people to God Himself, upon whom, in fact, a greater slight was put by this very request for a king "like all the nations," than upon Samuel (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).

But his dissatisfaction arose principally from the proposed change being revolutionary in its character. Though it would not entirely subvert their theocratic government, the appointment of a visible monarch would necessarily tend to throw out of view their unseen King and Head. God intimated, through Samuel, that their request would, in anger, be granted, while at the same time he apprised them of some of the evils that would result from their choice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Protest solemnly unto them; </span> that, if it be possible, thou mayst yet prevent their sin and misery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The manner of the king, </span> i.e. of the kings which they desire, like the kings of other nations.
