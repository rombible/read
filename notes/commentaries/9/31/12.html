The Jews in all cases buried their dead. The Chaldee therefore interpret the words relating this act of the men of Jabesh-Gilead, in the case of Saul and the princes, as referring to the solemn burning of spices, a ceremony which was afterwards performed at the burial of some of the kings of Judah. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm" title="And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him.">2Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-19.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.">2Chronicles 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm" title="But you shall die in peace: and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so shall they burn odors for you; and they will lament you, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 34:5</a>.) But the language used in these cases is different; here it is expressly stated that “they burnt them.” The reason for their thus acting is clear. The mutilated trunks had been exposed for some days to the air, and the flesh was no doubt in a state of putrefaction. The flesh here only was burned. The bones (see next verse) were reverently and lovingly preserved, and laid to rest beneath the friendly shade of the great tamarisk tree of Jabesh.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:8-13 The Scripture makes no mention what became of the souls of Saul and his sons, after they were dead; but of their bodies only: secret things belong not to us. It is of little consequence by what means we die, or what is done with our dead bodies. If our souls are saved, our bodies will be raised incorruptible and glorious; but not to fear His wrath, who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, is the extreme of folly and wickedness. How useless is the respect of fellow-creatures to those who are suffering the wrath of God! While pompous funerals, grand monuments, and he praises of men, honour the memory of the deceased, the soul may be suffering in the regions of darkness and despair!

Some suppose that the burning of the dead was afterwards practised by the Jews, and quote in its favour <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>, but these passages bear a different interpretation. After  the exile, interment was the sole method of disposing of the dead among the Jews, and in the Talmud cremation is condemned as a heathen practice. The burial of the bones of Saul and his sons proves that their bodies here were really burnt. <span class="cmt_word">Under a tree.</span> Hebrew, "under the tamarisk," the famous tree of that species at Jabesh. It was under one tamarisk that Saul commanded the massacre of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a>), and now his bones are placed in rest beneath another. Perhaps the people remembered the king's fondness for trees. For the final fate of these relics see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>. They <span class="cmt_word">fasted seven days</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>). The time of mourning was thirty days for Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-29.htm">Numbers 20:29</a>) and for Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>). The Talmudic rule is strict mourning for seven days, less strict for the next twenty-three, in all thirty; and for a father or mother mourning was continued for a year. The fasting was mourning of the strictest kind, and proves that the people of Jabesh-Gilead honored to the utmost their deliverer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Philistines followed Saul, smote (i.e., put to death) his three sons (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm">1 Samuel 14:49</a>), and fought fiercely against Saul himself. When the archers (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is an explanatory apposition to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) hit him, i.e., overtook him, he was greatly alarmed at them (&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, from &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;),<p>(Note: The lxx have adopted the rendering &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, they wounded him in the abdomen, whilst the Vulgate rendering is vulneratus est vehementer a sagittariis. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-3.htm">1 Chronicles 10:3</a> the Sept. rendering is &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, and that of the Vulgate et vulneraverunt jaculis. The translators have therefore derived &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and then given a free rendering to the other words. But this rendering is overthrown by the word &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;, very, vehemently, to say nothing of the fact that the verb &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1500;&#1492; cannot be proved to be ever used in the sense of wounding. If Saul had been so severely wounded that he could not kill himself, and therefore asked his armour-bearer to slay him, as Thenius supposes, he would not have had the strength to pierce himself with his sword when the armour-bearer refused. The further conjecture of Thenius, that the Hebrew text should be read thus, in accordance with the lxx, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, "he was wounded in the region of the gall," is opposed by the circumstance that &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; is not the gall or region of the gall, but what is under the &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, or breast cartilage, viz., the abdomen and bowels.)<p>and called upon his armour-bearer to pierce him with the sword, "lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and play with me," i.e., cool their courage upon me by maltreating me. But as the armour-bearer would not do this, because he was very much afraid, since he was supposed to be answerable for the king's life, Saul inflicted death upon himself with his sword; whereupon the armour-bearer also fell upon his sword and died with his king, so that on that day Saul and this three sons and his armour-bearer all died; also "all his men" (for which we have "all his house" in the Chronicles), i.e., not all the warriors who went out with him to battle, but all the king's servants, or all the members of his house, sc., who had taken part in the battle. Neither Abner nor his son Ishbosheth was included, for the latter was not in the battle; and although the former was Saul's cousin and commander-in-chief (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50-51</a>), he did not belong to his house or servants.</body></html>
