Without comment he copies into his record the hymn of David on Saul and Jonathan, just as he found it in the <span class= "ital">Book of Jashar </span>(the collection of national odes celebrating the heroes of the Theocracy). “There David speaks of the Saul of earlier times—the mighty conqueror, the delight of his people, the father of his beloved and faithful friend—like him in life, united with him in death.” (Stanley).<p>“Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives<p>And in their death they were not divided.<p>Than eagles they were swifter, than lions more strong.”<p>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm" title="Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.">2Samuel 1:23</a>.) From the lost <span class= "ital">Book of Jashar.</span><p>Nothing is known of the two younger princes who fell fighting here by their father’s side, sword in hand against the enemies of their country.<p>The hero Jonathan and his two brave brothers, as far as we can gather from the scanty details of the battle after the army was routed in the valley of Jezreel, retreated (fighting all the while) to the hill of Gilboa.

There was also a special providence of God in taking away Jonathan, (who, of all Saul’s sons, seems to have been the fairest for the crown,) for preventing divisions, which might have happened among the people concerning the successor: David’s way to the crown being by this means made the more clear. <span class="ital">Abinadab — </span>Called also <span class="ital">Ishui, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm" title="Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:">1 Samuel 14:49</a>.

Thus the prediction of Samuel was fulfilled: but who can forbear dropping a tear over the faithful, the amiable, the excellent Jonathan? “There are few characters among men more lovely or more extraordinary than his: fortitude, fidelity, magnanimity! a soul susceptible of the most refined friendship, and superior to all the temptations of ambition and vanity! and all these crowned with the most resigned submission to the will of God.” — Delaney.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:1-7 We cannot judge of the spiritual or eternal state of any by the manner of their death; for in that, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked. Saul, when sorely wounded, and unable to resist or to flee, expressed no concern about his never-dying soul; but only desired that the Philistines might not insult over him, or put him to pain, and he became his own murderer. As it is the grand deceit of the devil, to persuade sinners, under great difficulties, to fly to this last act of desperation, it is well to fortify the mind against it, by a serious consideration of its sinfulness before God, and its miserable consequences in society. But our security is not in ourselves. Let us seek protection from Him who keepeth Israel. Let us watch and pray; and take unto us the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hebron - Now El-Khulil (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>).

Now the Philistines fought against Israel&#8212;In a regular engagement, in which the two armies met (1Sa 28:1-4), the Israelites were forced to give way, being annoyed by the arrows of the enemy, which, destroying them at a distance before they came to close combat, threw them into panic and disorder. Taking advantage of the heights of Mount Gilboa, [the Israelites] attempted to rally, but in vain. Saul and his sons fought like heroes; but the onset of the Philistines being at length mainly directed against the quarter where they were, Jonathan and two brothers, Abinadab or Ishui (1Sa 14:49) and Melchishua, overpowered by numbers, were killed on the spot.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Philistines slew Jonathan, </span> David’s dear friend; God so ordering it for the further exercise of David’s faith and patience; and that David might depend upon God alone for his crown, and receive it solely from him, and not from Jonathan; who doubtless, had he lived, would have speedily settled the crown upon David’s head, which would have in some sort eclipsed the glory of God’s grace and power in this work.

Sending these gifts could not fail to make the elders of these cities well disposed towards him, and so to facilitate his recognition as king after the death of Saul, which occurred immediately afterwards. Some of these places may have been plundered by the Amalekites, since they had invaded the Negeb of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). The cities referred to were Bethel, - not the Bethel so often mentioned, the present Beitin, in the tribe of Benjamin, but Betheul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-30.htm">1 Chronicles 4:30</a>) or Bethul, in the tribe of Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>), which Knobel supposes to be Elusa or el Khalasa (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-30.htm">Joshua 15:30</a>). The reading &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1; in the lxx is a worthless conjecture. Ramah of the south, which was allotted to the tribe of Simeon, has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-8.htm">Joshua 19:8</a>). Jattir has been preserved in the ruins of Attir, on the southern portion of the Mountains of Judah (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>). Aror is still to be seen in ruins, viz., in the foundations of walls built in enormous stones in Wady Arara, where there are many cavities for holding water, about three hours E.S.E. of Bersaba, and twenty miles to the south of Hebron (vid., Rob. Pal. ii. p. 620, and v. de Velde, Mem. p. 288). Siphmoth (or Shiphmoth, according to several MSS) is altogether unknown. It may probably be referred to again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-27.htm">1 Chronicles 27:27</a>, where Zabdi is called the Shiphmite; but it is certainly not to be identified with Sepham, on the north-east of the sea of Galilee (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-10.htm">Numbers 34:10-11</a>), as Thenius supposes. Eshtemoa has been preserved in the village of Semua, with ancient ruins, on the south-western portion of the mountains of Judah (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-50.htm">Joshua 15:50</a>). Racal is never mentioned again, and is entirely unknown. The lxx have five different names instead of this, the last being Carmel, into which Thenius proposes to alter Racal. But this can hardly be done with propriety, as the lxx also introduced the Philistian Gath, which certainly does not belong here; whilst in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-30.htm">1 Samuel 30:30</a> they have totally different names, some of which are decidedly wrong. The cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites were situated in the Negeb of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>), but their names cannot be traced.</body></html>
