The men of Jabesh-Gilead well remembered this peculiar fancy of their dead king, and under the waving branches of their own beautiful and famous tamarisk they tenderly laid the remains of their dead hero and his princely sons.<p>Evidently King David, at a subsequent period, fetched away these royal remains, and had them reverently interred in the family sepulchre of Kish, the father of Saul, in Zelah of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-12.htm" title="And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:">2Samuel 21:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-14.htm" title="And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.">2Samuel 21:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And fasted seven days.</span>—This was the period the sons of Israel mourned for Jacob at the threshing floor of Atad beyond Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-10.htm" title="And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:10</a>). The grateful men of Jabesh-Gilead thus paid the last honours to the fallen Saul.<p>It is probable that the Talmudic rule which enjoins strict mourning for seven days (fasting was mourning of the strictest kind) was originally based on these two historic periods of mourning recorded in the case of the great ancestor of the tribes, Jacob, and of the first King Saul, although the curious tradition preserved in the Babylonian Talmud gives a special reason for the period—seven days. Rav. Chisda said: The soul of the deceased mourns over him <span class= "ital">the first seven days; </span>for it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-22.htm" title="But his flesh on him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.">Job 14:22</a>, “and his soul shall mourn over him.” Rav. Jehudah said: If there are no mourners to condole with, ten men sit down where the death took place. Such a case happened in the neighbourhood of Rav. Jehudah. <span class= "ital">After the seven days of mourning, </span>the deceased appeared to Rav. Jehudah in a dream, and said <span class= "ital">“</span>Mayest thou be comforted as thou hast comforted me.”—Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>fol. 152, Colossians 2.<p>To this day among the Jews ten men are hired to perform the usual daily prayers during <span class= "ital">the seven days </span>of mourning at the house of the deceased.<p>On the reason for the number <span class= "ital">seven </span>being fixed for the period of mourning, we read again in the <span class= "ital">Seder Moed </span>of the Babylonian Talmud, “How is it proved that mourning should be kept up <span class= "ital">seven days? </span>“It is written, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm" title="And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.">Amos 8:10</a> : “I will turn your feasts into mourning,” and these (usually) lasted seven days.—Treatise <span class= "ital">Moed Katon, </span>fol. 20, Colossians 1.<p>“Again a long draught of my soul-wine!

But we must not understand this word of fasting strictly, as if they ate nothing for seven whole days; but in a more large sense, as it is used both in sacred and profane writers; that they did eat but little, and that but mean food, and drank only water for that time. This book began with the birth of Samuel, and ends with the death of Saul. The comparing these together will teach us to prefer the honour that comes from God before all the honours of the world. The reader will do well to observe also that in this book we have two such examples of piety and virtue in Samuel and David as we cannot too frequently make the subject of our consideration. On the other hand, in the example of Saul we have a picture of the miserable state of that man who forgetteth God, and turneth aside from his commandments. May God, through Jesus Christ, send down his grace into our hearts, that, through our whole lives, we may be inclined to imitate the first, and may always dread to fall into the state of the latter, and, as the only way to escape it, make it our chief study and delight to please God, and do his will; for this is the whole of man: in which all his happiness, all his peace consists. For that there is no peace to the wicked, hath been pronounced by Him who knoweth the nature and frame of man; by the Lord himself, who cannot lie. “The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/57-20.htm" title="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt....">Isaiah 57:20-21</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:8-13 The Scripture makes no mention what became of the souls of Saul and his sons, after they were dead; but of their bodies only: secret things belong not to us. It is of little consequence by what means we die, or what is done with our dead bodies. If our souls are saved, our bodies will be raised incorruptible and glorious; but not to fear His wrath, who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, is the extreme of folly and wickedness. How useless is the respect of fellow-creatures to those who are suffering the wrath of God! While pompous funerals, grand monuments, and he praises of men, honour the memory of the deceased, the soul may be suffering in the regions of darkness and despair!
