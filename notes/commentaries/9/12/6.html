And they answered, He is witness.">1Samuel 12:5</a>) had with one consent cried out, in reply to Samuel’s solemn calling God and the king to witness, <span class= "ital">He is witness. </span>Then Samuel takes up their words with great emphasis, <span class= "ital">even the Eternal that advanced Moses, &c. </span>The English rendering greatly weakens the dramatic force of the original Hebrew. The LXX. has caught accurately the thought by supplying the word “witness “: thus, <span class= "ital">The Lord is witness, &c.</span><p>The Exodus is mentioned in this and in many places in these ancient records of the people as the great call of love by which the Eternal assumed the sovereignty over Israel. The Talmud here comments: “It is the Lord that made Moses and Aaron” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-6.htm" title="And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 12:6</a>); and it is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm" title="And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelled safe.">1Samuel 12:11</a>), “And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel.” Scripture balances in the same scale the three least important with the three most important personages, in order to teach thee that Jerrubbaal in his generation was like Moses in his, Bedan (said to be Samson) like Aaron, and Jephthah like Samuel. Hence the most insignificant man, if appointed a ruler of the congregation, has the same authority as the most important personage.—Treatise <span class= "ital">Rosh-Hashanah, </span>fol. 25, Colossians 2.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:6-15 The work of ministers is to reason with people; not only to exhort and direct, but to persuade, to convince men's judgments, and so to gain their wills and affections. Samuel reasons of the righteous acts of the Lord. Those who follow God faithfully, he will enable to continue following him. Disobedience would certainly be the ruin of Israel. We mistake if we think that we can escape God's justice, by trying to shake off his dominion. If we resolve that God shall not rule us, yet he will judge us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Advanced - In the sense of appointing them to their office.

Samuel's purpose is to impress the people with the conviction that Yahweh was their God, and the God of their fathers; that to Him they owed their national existence and all their national blessings, and that faithfulness to Him, to the exclusion of all other worship <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm">1 Samuel 12:21</a> was the only safety of the newly-established monarchy. Observe the constant reference to the Exodus as the well-known turning-point of their national life (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-8.htm">1 Samuel 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-6.htm">1 Samuel 6:6</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 12:6-16.

Having cleared and established his own character, he proceeds to lay before the people some of the great things God had done for them formerly, and quite down to the present time, the more to aggravate their ingratitude in rejecting God as their King: <p>it is the Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron; raised them from a low estate, the one in a foreign country in Midian, the other in bondage in Egypt, to be deliverers, guides, and governors of his people Israel. Kimchi thinks this refers to what goes before, and that the sense is, that God, that raised Moses and Aaron to great honour and dignity, was a witness between him and the people; in which he is followed by some Christian interpreters. Ben Gersom makes mention of the same, but rather approves of the connection of the words with what follows, as does Abarbinel, and is doubtless most correct; the Targum is,"who hath done mighty things by the hands of Moses and Aaron:" <p>and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt; when they were in bondage there, and that by the means of Moses and Aaron, by whose hands he wrought signs and wonders and inflicted plagues on the Egyptians, which made them willing at last to let Israel go. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">It is the Lord</span>] Or, <span class="bld">Yea Jehovah [is witness].</span> This verse forms the transition to what follows.

Then Samuel solemnly repeats Jehovah s name, saying, "Even Jehovah that advanced Moses and Aaron." This rapid interchange of words brings the whole scene vividly before us, whereas nothing could be tamer than the A.V. Out of the land of Egypt. Samuel begins with this as the first act of Jehovah as Israel's King; for the theocracy began with the deliverance from Egypt. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samuel turned this victory to account, by calling upon the people to go with him to Gilgal, and there renew the monarchy. In what the renewal consisted is not clearly stated; but it is simply recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a> that "they (the whole people) made Saul king there before the Lord in Gilgal." Many commentators have supposed that he was anointed afresh, and appeal to David's second anointing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>). But David's example merely proves as Seb. Schmidt has correctly observed, that the anointing could be repeated under certain circumstances; but it does not prove that it was repeated, or must have been repeated, in the case of Saul. If the ceremony of anointing had been performed, it would no doubt have been mentioned, just as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>. But &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; does not mean "they anointed," although the lxx have rendered it &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, according to their own subjective interpretation. The renewal of the monarchy may very well have consisted in nothing more than a solemn confirmation of the election that had taken place at Mizpeh, in which Samuel once more laid before both king and people the right of the monarchy, receiving from both parties in the presence of the Lord the promise to observe this right, and sealing the vow by a solemn sacrifice. The only sacrifices mentioned are zebachim shelamim, i.e., peace-offerings. These were thank-offerings, which were always connected with a sacrificial meal, and when presented on joyous occasions, formed a feast of rejoicing for those who took part, since the sacrificial meal shadowed forth a living and peaceful fellowship with the Lord. Gilgal is in all probability the place where Samuel judged the people every year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). But whether it was the Gilgal in the plain of the Jordan, or Jiljilia on higher ground to the south-west of Shiloh, it is by no means easy to determine. The latter is favoured, apart from the fact that Samuel did not say "Let us go down," but simply "Let us go" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>), by the circumstance that the solemn ceremony took place after the return from the war at Jabesh; since it is hardly likely that the people would have gone down into the valley of the Jordan to Gilgal, whereas Jiljilia was close by the road from Jabesh to Gibeah and Ramah. </body></html>
