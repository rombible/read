The instances which are here adduced of the people being given up into the hands of strange hostile nations are prominent ones, quoted as they occurred to him, without any careful attention being paid to the order of events and times, which was here not necessary for the course of his argument. Three leading nations out of the neighbouring peoples are mentioned by him as having been allowed, in consequence of Israel’s rebellion against the Eternal, to oppress and harass, for a season, the tribes of God’s inheritance—the Canaanites, the Philistines, and the Moabites.<p><span class= "bld">Captain of the host of Hazor.</span>—Hazor is mentioned as the capital city of the Canaanites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,">Joshua 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-10.htm" title="And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.">Joshua 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-13.htm" title="But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.">Joshua 11:13</a>, &c., and again as a royal residence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm" title="And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles.">Judges 4:2</a>. Sisera is specially named as the well-known commander of the army against which Israel fought, and as the victim of the sanguinary but patriotic deed of fury of Jael.<p><span class= "bld">Into the hand of the Philistines.</span>—These “Phœnicians,” who literally dwelt among the Israelites, were most formidable foes to the chosen people for a long series of years. We have before compared their many strongholds and fastnesses to those robber nests which in the stormy middle ages disturbed the peace, and were the scourge of the commerce and trade, of Central Europe. It was owing especially to these Philistines that for so long a period such slow progress in wealth and the arts of civilisation was made in Israel. The advance of the Hebrew nation, from the days of Samuel, who first really checked these Philistine robbers, was singularly rapid. In an almost incredibly short period, from being a poor, half-barbarous people, the Israelites became a highly cultured, wealthy, and powerful nation. In great measure this strangely rapid progress was owing to the complete subjugation of the Philistines under the rule of Samuel, Saul, and David.<p><span class= "bld">The king of Moab.</span>—The king referred to here is Eglon, who was slain by Ehud.

Samuel reasons of the righteous acts of the Lord. Those who follow God faithfully, he will enable to continue following him. Disobedience would certainly be the ruin of Israel. We mistake if we think that we can escape God's justice, by trying to shake off his dominion.

But Samuel here places it as the first great servitude, before that under Eglon king of Moab, or that from which Shamgar delivered them. And this is in accordance with the internal evidence of the Book of Judges itself. It is also the order of <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-11.htm">Judges 10:11</a>, except that there the Ammonites <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a> are placed before the Philistines. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-16. Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you&#8212;The burden of this faithful and uncompromising address was to show them, that though they had obtained the change of government they had so importunely desired, their conduct was highly displeasing to their heavenly King; nevertheless, if they remained faithful to Him and to the principles of the theocracy, they might be delivered from many of the evils to which the new state of things would expose them. And in confirmation of those statements, no less than in evidence of the divine displeasure, a remarkable phenomenon, on the invocation of the prophet, and of which he gave due premonition, took place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They forgat the Lord, </span> i.e. they revolted from him, as it is explained, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm" title="And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.">1 Samuel 12:10</a></span>, and carried themselves as ungratefully and unworthily towards God, as if they had wholly forgotten his great and innumerable favours, and their infinite obligations to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Forgetting of God</span> is oft put for all manner of wickedness, whereof indeed that is the true cause.

(1) The Canaanites, who were led by Sisera, general of the army of King Jabin. Their chief city was Hazor (= <span class="ital">stronghold</span>) situated on the high ground west of the Lake of Merom, where <span class="ital">Jebel Hadîreh</span> perhaps still preserves the name. This oppression lasted for 20 years. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm" title="And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.">Jdg 4:5</a>. (2) The Philistines.

(3) The Moabites under Eglon. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/3-12.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD....">Jdg 3:12-30</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they forgat Jehovah their God.</span> The theocracy, as we have seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-18.htm">1 Samuel 10:18</a>), was a moral government, under which idolatry and the immorality attendant upon it, as being rebellion, were punished by Jehovah's withdrawing his protection, and the consequent subjection of the nation to foreign rule. It was the repeated sin, therefore, of the people which made Israel's history so checquered. Sisera (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>), and Eaton, king of Moab.

The thought is not that the judge covers his eyes from the copher, that he may not see the bribe, but that he covers his eyes with the money offered him as a bribe, so as not to see and not to punish the crime committed.</body></html>
