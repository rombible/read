This was to convince them they had done wickedly in asking a king; not only by its coming at an unusual time, in wheat harvest, and on a clear day, but by the prophet's giving notice of it before. He showed their folly in desiring a king to save them, rather than God, or Samuel; promising themselves more from an arm of flesh, than from the arm of God, or from the power of prayer. Could their prince command such forces as the prophet could do by his prayers? It startled them very much. Some will not be brought to see their sins by any gentler methods than storms and thunders. They entreat Samuel to pray for them. Now they see their need of him whom shortly before they slighted. Thus many who will not have Christ to reign over them, would yet be glad to have him intercede for them, to turn away the wrath of God. Samuel aims to confirm the people in their religion. Whatever we make a god of, we shall find it deceive us. Creatures in their own places are good; but when put in God's place, they are vain things. We sin if we restrain prayer, and in particular if we cease praying for the church. They only asked him to pray for them; but he promises to do more, to teach them. He urges that they were bound in gratitude to serve God, considering what great things he had done for them; and that they were bound in interest to serve him, considering what he would do against them, if they should still do wickedly. Thus, as a faithful watchman, he gave them warning, and so delivered his own soul. If we consider what great things the Lord hath done for us, especially in the great work of redemption, we can neither want motive, encouragement, nor assistance in serving him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wheat harvest - Between May 15 and June 15.

Is it not wheat harvest to-day?&#8212;That season in Palestine occurs at the end of June or beginning of July, when it seldom or never rains, and the sky is serene and cloudless. There could not, therefore, have been a stronger or more appropriate proof of a divine mission than the phenomenon of rain and thunder happening, without any prognostics of its approach, upon the prediction of a person professing himself to be a prophet of the Lord, and giving it as an attestation of his words being true. The people regarded it as a miraculous display of divine power, and, panic-struck, implored the prophet to pray for them. Promising to do so, he dispelled their fears. The conduct of Samuel, in this whole affair of the king's appointment, shows him to have been a great and good man who sank all private and personal considerations in disinterested zeal for his country's good and whose last words in public were to warn the people, and their king, of the danger of apostasy and disobedience to God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Turn ye not aside, </span> to wit, after idols; as they had often done before; and, notwithstanding this warning, did afterwards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Should ye go, </span> or, <span class="ital">should ye turn aside</span>; which words are easily to be understood out of the foregoing branch, such ellipses being most frequent in Scripture, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-4.htm" title="After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelled in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelled at Astaroth in Edrei:">Deu 1:4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-14.htm" title="Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.">1 Kings 14:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm" title="But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house.

The same word is applied to them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-29.htm" title="Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.">Isaiah 41:29</a> (E.

It means anything <span class="accented">empty, void</span>, and so is often used, as here, for "an idol," because, as St. Paul says, "an idol is nothing in the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>). So Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>) calls the makers of idols vanity, Hebrew, <span class="accented">tohu, i.e.</span> empty people, with no sense in them.

The allusion to the fathers is very suitable here, because the people were looking to the king for the removal of all the calamities, which had fallen upon them from time immemorial. The paraphrase of this word, which is adopted in the Septuagint, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, is a very unhappy conjecture, although Thenius proposes to alter the text to suit it.</body></html>
