Gideon was surnamed Jerubbaal out of scorn and derision for the Phœnician deity: “Let Baal then strive or contend with me, Gideon.”<p><span class= "bld">Bedan.</span>—This name does not occur in the record of the “judges.” We meet with it only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm" title="And the sons of Ulam; Bedan. These were the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh.">1Chronicles 7:17</a>, as a name of one of the descendants of Machir the Manassite, but this Bedan of the Chronicles seems to have been a person of no importance. The LXX. and the Syriac, the two most ancient versions, read, instead of Bedan, <span class= "ital">Barak. </span>The letters forming these two names in the Hebrew are very similar, and a scribe might easily have written the one for the other, and the mistake might well have been perpetuated—at least, this is probable. The famous Hebrew commentator, Rabbi D. Kimchi, suggests Bedan is written for Ben-Dan, the son of Dan <span class= "ital">the </span>Danite. that is. Samson. The list of Hebrew heroes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm" title="And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:">Hebrews 11:32</a> noticeably connects Barak with Gideon and Jephthah. Wordsworth curiously prefers to leave the unknown name of Bedan in the hero catalogue, because he argues “that in this very obscurity of the name we have a confirmation of the genuineness of the speech. A forger would not have ventured to insert a name which occurs nowhere else.”<p><span class= "bld">And Samuel.</span>—The Syriac Version substitutes Samson for Samuel, finding, doubtless, a difficulty in the quotation of his own name by the speaker. But the other versions uniformly agree with the Hebrew text, and in truth Samuel could well cite himself a signal instance of God’s loving pity in sending deliverance, conscious as he was of his own high mission. No judge had accomplished such great things for the people, and none had received more general recognition. It was a most fitting name to bring in at the close of his list.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm" title="And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelled safe.">1 Samuel 12:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Bedan — </span>We have no mention of Bedan in the book of Judges or elsewhere before, and therefore many commentators think this is another name for Barak.

Some versions and commentators read "Barak," the form of the letters of both words being in Hebrew somewhat similar.<p>And Samuel - There is nothing improper or out of place in Samuel mentioning his own judgeship. It had supplied a remarkable instance of God's deliverance <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12-15</a>; and, as it was the last as well as one of the very greatest deliverances, it was natural he should do so. The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a> is quite as favorable to the mention of Samuel here as to that of "Samson," which some propose to read instead of "Samuel." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Bedan&#8212;The Septuagint reads "Barak"; and for "Samuel" some versions read "Samson," which seems more natural than that the prophet should mention himself to the total omission of the greatest of the judges. (Compare Heb 11:32).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Bedan</span> is certainly one of the judges; and because there is no judge so called in the Book of Judges, it is reasonably concluded that this was one of the judges there mentioned having two names, as was very frequent. And this was either, first, Samson, as most interpreters believe, who is called <span class="ital">Bedan</span>, i.e. in Dan, or of Dan, or the son of Dan, one of the tribe, to signify that they had no reason to distrust that God, who could, and did, raise so eminent a saviour out of so obscure a tribe. Or, secondly, Jair the Gileadite, of whom <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-3.htm" title="And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.">Judges 10:3</a></span>; which may seem best to agree, first, With the time and order of the judges; for Jair was before Jephthah, but Samson was after him. Secondly, With other scriptures; for among the sons of a more ancient and a famous Jair, of whom see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm" title="And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.">Numbers 32:41</a></span>, we meet with one called Bedan, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm" title="And the sons of Ulam; Bedan. These were the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh.">1 Chronicles 7:17</a></span>, which name seems here given to Jair the judge, to distinguish him from that first Jair. Thirdly, With he following words, which show that this Bedan was one of those judges who <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">delivered them out of the hand of their enemies an every side, </span> and made them to <span class="ital">dwell safely</span>; which seems not so properly to agree to Samson, who did only <span class="ital">begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines</span>, as was foretold of him, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm" title="For, see, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.">Judges 13:5</a></span>, as to Jair, who kept them in peace and safety, in the midst of all their enemies, as may be gathered from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/10-3.htm" title="And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years....">Judges 10:3-6</a></span>; and so did all the rest of the judges here mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And Samuel; </span> he speaks of himself in the third person, which is frequent in the Hebrew tongue, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm" title="And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.">Genesis 4:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-1.htm" title="Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:">Psalm 132:1</a>,10,11 Da 1:6 <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm" title="The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.">Isaiah 1:1</a></span>. And he mentions himself not through vain ostentation, but for his own just and necessary vindication, and for the justification and enforcement of his following reproof, to show that he had not degenerated from his predecessors, nor had been so inconsiderable and unprofitable to them, as to give them any occasion to contrive or desire this change of government in his days. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye dwelled safe; </span> so that it was no necessity, but mere wantonness, that made you desire a change. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord sent Jerubbaal,.... Or Gideon, as the Targum, for Jerubbaal was the name given to Gideon, when he first became a judge, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>. <p>and Bedan; if this was one of the judges, he must have two names, or is one that is not mentioned in the book of Judges; the Targum interprets it of Samson; so Jerom (h), for the word may be rendered "in Dan"; one in Dan, who was of the tribe of Dan, as Samson was; and it was in the camp of Dan the Spirit of God first came upon him; and Kimchi observes that it is the same as Bendan, the son of Dan, that is, a Danite; and though he was after Jephthah, yet is set before him, because he was a greater man than he; and this way go the generality of Jewish writers (i); but a man of this name being among the posterity of Manasseh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>. Junius, and who is followed by others, thinks that Jair is meant, and is so called to distinguish him from a more ancient Jair, the son of Manasseh, and with whom the order of the judges better agrees, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a> but the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions read Barak; and he may rather be thought to be meant, because he was the instrument of delivering Israel out of the hand of Sisera, the captain of the host of Hazor before mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-9.htm">1 Samuel 12:9</a> and agrees with the words of the apostle, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a>, who mentions those judges much in the same order: <p>and Jephthah, and Samuel; meaning himself, who was the last of the judges, and who speaks of himself as of a third person, as Lamech does, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a> and this he did not out of ostentation, but to observe that God had made him an instrument of delivering them out of the hand of the Philistines, which must be fresh in their memory, as he had made use of others before him, when he sent judges, and not kings, and therefore they had no need to ask a king. The Syriac and Arabic versions read Samson instead of Samuel, and which also agrees best with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a>. <p>and delivered you out of the hands of your enemies on every side; not the judges, but the Lord; for the word for "delivered" is of the singular number: <p>and ye dwelled safe; in the greatest security and confidence, without any fear of enemies, having God their King in the midst of them, and stood in no need of any other king to protect and defend them. <p>(h) Heb.

(1) Jerubbaal, who brought the Midianite oppression to an end (Judges 6-8). His original name <span class="ital">Gideon</span> was changed to <span class="ital">Jerubbaal</span> (= <span class="ital">let Baal plead</span>) for his bold act of piety in destroying the altar of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/6-31.htm" title="And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you plead for Baal? will you save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one has cast down his altar....">Jdg 6:31-32</a>). (2) Bedan. This name is not found in the book of Judges, but as that book is not a complete history, Bedan may possibly have been the name of a judge not mentioned there. But more probably Bedan is a copyist’s error for <span class="ital">Barak</span>, which is the reading of the Sept. and Syriac. The letters of the two words are much alike. In this case the reference will be to the deliverance from the Canaanite oppression already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm" title="And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?">Jdg 4:6</a> ff.). Bedan has also been explained as a name of Samson, either = <span class="ital">Ben-Dan</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">the son of Dan</span> or Danite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm" title="And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.">Jdg 13:2</a>): or as a bye-name = <span class="ital">corpulent</span>. (3) Jephthah the Gileadite, who routed the Ammonites (Judges 11). (4) Samuel. That Samuel should thus mention himself need not surprise us if we remember (<span class="ital">a</span>) that the apparent abruptness of the mention is due to the condensation of the narrative, which gives only a summary of the original speech: (<span class="ital">b</span>) that he has resigned his office, and standing as it were outside the era of the Judges, he reviews it as a whole: (<span class="ital">c</span>) that in order to point his rebuke of the Israelites for ingratitude to Jehovah in asking a king, it was necessary to prove that He had not forsaken them, but had continued His deliverances down to the present.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bedan</span>. Numerous ingenious explanations of this name have been given, but the only probable account is that Bedan is a misreading for Barak. The two names are very similar in the Hebrew, and the two most ancient versions, the Septuagint and the Syriac, actually have Barak. <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel.</span> This is even more puzzling than Bedan. We cannot suppose that Samuel, who hitherto had confined himself to the old deliverances, would thus suddenly introduce his own name. In mentioning only them he had avoided everything that would grate upon the ears of the people, but this would look like giving way to personal vexation. Some, therefore, would read Samson; but this, though found in the Syriac, is supported by no other version. Possibly some scribe, mindful of Samuel's recent achievement at Mizpah, wrote his name in the margin, whence it was admitted into the text. <span class="cmt_word">And ye dwelled safe.</span> Literally, "in confidence," in security. With sin came danger and unquiet; upon repentance, not only was their country free from danger, but their minds were at rest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To confirm this declaration on the part of the people, he then called Jehovah and His anointed as witnesses against the people, and they accepted these witnesses. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is the subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;; and the Keri &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, though more simple, is by no means necessary. Samuel said, "Jehovah be witness against you," because with the declaration which the people had made concerning Samuel's judicial labours they had condemned themselves, inasmuch as they had thereby acknowledged on oath that there was no ground for their dissatisfaction with Samuel's administration, and consequently no well-founded reason for their request for a king.</body></html>
