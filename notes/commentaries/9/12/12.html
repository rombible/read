Samuel reasons of the righteous acts of the Lord. Those who follow God faithfully, he will enable to continue following him. Disobedience would certainly be the ruin of Israel. We mistake if we think that we can escape God's justice, by trying to shake off his dominion.

Some versions and commentators read "Barak," the form of the letters of both words being in Hebrew somewhat similar.<p>And Samuel - There is nothing improper or out of place in Samuel mentioning his own judgeship. It had supplied a remarkable instance of God's deliverance <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12-15</a>; and, as it was the last as well as one of the very greatest deliverances, it was natural he should do so. The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a> is quite as favorable to the mention of Samuel here as to that of "Samson," which some propose to read instead of "Samuel." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Bedan&#8212;The Septuagint reads "Barak"; and for "Samuel" some versions read "Samson," which seems more natural than that the prophet should mention himself to the total omission of the greatest of the judges.

Or "but yet" (k); however, notwithstanding though the Lord had been so kind and gracious to them, as to raise up judges one after another to deliver them, when they cried unto him, yet when they perceived that Nahash the Ammonite was preparing to make war with them, instead of applying to the Lord for his protection, they desired to have a king to go before them, and fight their battles, as follows: nay, <p>but a king shall reign over us; though Samuel told them they had no need of one: <p>when the Lord your God was your King; and would protect and defend them, if they applied to him, and would put their trust in him; and he himself Samuel was their judge, and would be their general and commander, and they had experience of success under him to the utter destruction of their enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a> and yet, notwithstanding all this, they insisted upon it to have a king. According to Abarbinel, this preparation of Nahash to war with them was after they had asked for a king, and was a punishment of them for their request; and yet they repented not of it, but in effect said, though Nahash, and all the enemies in the world come against us, we will not go back from our request, but insist on it, that we have a king to reign over us; such was their obstinacy and perverseness. <p>(k) "videntes autem", V.

We thus, too, should be able to account for the rancour displayed in his wish so to treat the men of that town as to make them a reproach to all Israel; for his hatred of Israel may have grown in intensity in the  course of a harassing war, or he may have learnt to despise a people incapable of offering a regular resistance. At all events, Samuel describes Nahash as giving the final impetus to the desire of the nation for a king. <span class="cmt_word">When Jehovah your God was your king.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But in order to bring the people to a still more thorough acknowledgment of their sin, Samuel strengthened still more their assent to his solemn appeal to God, as expressed in the words "He is witness," by saying, "Jehovah (i.e., yea, the witness is Jehovah), who made Moses and Aaron, and brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt." The context itself is sufficient to show that the expression "is witness" is understood; and there is no reason, therefore, to assume that the word has dropped out of the text through a copyist's error. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to make, in a moral and historical sense, i.e., to make a person what he is to be; it has no connection, therefore, with his physical birth, but simply relates to his introduction upon the stage of history, like &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2</a>. But if Jehovah, who redeemed Israel out of Egypt by the hands of Moses and Aaron, and exalted it into His own nation, was witness of the unselfishness and impartiality of Samuel's conduct in his office of judge, then Israel had grievously sinned by demanding a king. In the person of Samuel they had rejected Jehovah their God, who had given them their rulers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). Samuel proves this still further to the people from the following history. </body></html>
