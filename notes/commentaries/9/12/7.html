See now, he says, we have advanced thus far in my solemn pleading. Stand up now, ye elders, while I proceed. My innocence, as your judge, you have thus borne witness to, before God and the king, yet in spite of this you have wished to be quit of me, and of One who stood high above me—of One who has worked for you such mighty deeds, even the Eternal. See now, ye elders, what He has done for your fathers and for you, this invisible King, whom ye have just deliberately replaced by an earthly king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-7.htm" title="Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.">1 Samuel 12:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now, therefore, stand still — </span>Having obtained an honourable testimony from them as to his own conduct, he would not dismiss them till he had represented to them the great benefits which they had received from God, and their ingratitude to him. <span class="ital">Of all the righteous acts of the Lord — </span>Hebrews <span class="ital">the righteousnesses; </span>that is, mercies or benefits, the chief subject of the following discourse; some of their calamities being but briefly named, and that for the illustration of God’s mercy in their deliverances.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:6-15 The work of ministers is to reason with people; not only to exhort and direct, but to persuade, to convince men's judgments, and so to gain their wills and affections.

We mistake if we think that we can escape God's justice, by trying to shake off his dominion.
