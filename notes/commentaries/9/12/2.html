The term “walketh before you implied generally that the kingly office included the guiding and governing the people, as well as the especial duty of leading them in war; from henceforth they must accept his authority on all occasions, not merely in great emergencies. Both king and people must understand that the days when Saul could quietly betake himself to his old pursuits on the farm of the Ephraim hills were now past for ever. He must lead, and they must follow. The metaphor is taken from the usual place of a shepherd in the East, where he goes before his flock. Compare the words of our Lord, who uses the same image of a shepherd walking before his sheep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:">John 10:27</a>): “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they <span class= "ital">follow </span>me.”<p><span class= "bld">And I am old and grayheaded.</span>—Here the prophet, with some pathos, refers to the elders’ own words at Ramah (chap 8:5). Yes, said the seer, I am old—grown grey in your service; listen to me while I ask you what manner of service that has been. Can any one find in it a flaw? has it not been pure and disinterested throughout?<p><span class= "bld">My sons are with you.</span>—Yes, old indeed, for my offspring are numbered now among the grown men of the people. Possibly, however, a tinge of mortified feeling at the rejection of himself and his family, mixed with a desire to recommend his sons to the favour and goodwill of the nation, is at the bottom of this mention of them.—<span class= "ital">Speaker’s Commentary. </span>It is evident that these sons, whose conduct as Samuel’s deputies had excited the severest criticism on the part of the elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm" title="And said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.">1Samuel 8:5</a>), had been reduced—with the full consent, of course, of their father, who up to this period exercised evidently supreme power in all the coasts of Israel—to the condition of mere private citizens.<p><span class= "bld">From my childhood unto this day.</span>—Samuel’s life had in truth been constantly before the public observation from very early days; well known to all were the details of his career—his early consecration under peculiar and exceptional circumstances to the sanctuary service, the fact of the “word of the Lord” coming directly to him when still a boy, his recognition by the people directly afterwards as a prophet, then his restless, unwearied work during the dark days which followed the fall of Shiloh. It was indeed a public life. He would have Israel, now they had virtually rejected his rule, think over that long busy life of his for a moment, and then pronounce a judgment on it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-2.htm" title="And now, behold, the king walks before you: and I am old and gray headed; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.">1 Samuel 12:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">The king walketh before you — </span>Ruleth over you.

He invested with his office, and in the exercise of it, and goes in and out as the captain, commander, and leader of the people; it is expressive of his being in the full possession of regal power and authority, and therefore Samuel might speak the more freely, as he could not be thought to have any hope and expectation of being reinstated in his government, or to have parted with it with any regret; and he wisely took this opportunity of reproving the people for their sin of desiring a king, when Saul was settled and established in his kingdom, and when they were in the midst of all their mirth and jollity, who might, from the success that had attended this first adventure of their king, conclude that they had done a right and good thing in requesting to have one: <p>and I am old, and grey headed; and so unfit for government, and very willing to be eased of the burden of it: he must surely be more than fifty two years of age, as the Jews generally say he was, since it is not usual at such an age to be grey headed; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-1.htm">1 Samuel 8:1</a>; however, on this account he merited reverence and respect, and demanded attention: <p>and, behold, my sons are with you; as private persons in the condition of subjects, making no pretension to government; and if they had committed anything criminal, they were open to the law, and might be charged, and tried, and treated according to their deserts; and there they were, and might be asked what questions they thought proper with respect to what they knew of his conduct; and to be hostages or bail for him, if they could prove anything against him; or to be taken to make satisfaction for any injuries committed by him: <p>and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day; his manner of and conversation from his infancy to this time was well known to them, and he had spent all his days in the service of God, and for the good of Israel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And now, behold, the king walketh <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons <i>are</i> with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.</span><p>(b) To govern you in peace and war.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the king walketh before you</span>] Goes in and out in your presence in the exercise of his regal authority.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and I am old and gray-headed; and, behold my sons are with you</span>] Samuel refers to the two reasons alleged by the elders in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm" title="And said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.">1 Samuel 8:5</a> for asking a king, (<span class="ital">a</span>) his own age, (<span class="ital">b</span>) the misgovernment of his sons.

The metaphor is taken from the position of the shepherd in the East, where he goes before his flock to guide and guard them. On this account the word shepherd or pastor is used in the Bible of the temporal ruler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>, etc.), and not, as with us, of the spiritual guide. <span class="cmt_word">My sons are with you.</span> This is no mere confirmation of the fact just stated that he was old, but a direct challenge of their dissatisfaction with his sons' conduct, as far at least as concerns any connivance on his part, or support of them in their  covetousness.
