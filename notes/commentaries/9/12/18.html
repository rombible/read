This was to convince them they had done wickedly in asking a king; not only by its coming at an unusual time, in wheat harvest, and on a clear day, but by the prophet's giving notice of it before. He showed their folly in desiring a king to save them, rather than God, or Samuel; promising themselves more from an arm of flesh, than from the arm of God, or from the power of prayer. Could their prince command such forces as the prophet could do by his prayers? It startled them very much. Some will not be brought to see their sins by any gentler methods than storms and thunders. They entreat Samuel to pray for them. Now they see their need of him whom shortly before they slighted. Thus many who will not have Christ to reign over them, would yet be glad to have him intercede for them, to turn away the wrath of God. Samuel aims to confirm the people in their religion. Whatever we make a god of, we shall find it deceive us. Creatures in their own places are good; but when put in God's place, they are vain things. We sin if we restrain prayer, and in particular if we cease praying for the church. They only asked him to pray for them; but he promises to do more, to teach them. He urges that they were bound in gratitude to serve God, considering what great things he had done for them; and that they were bound in interest to serve him, considering what he would do against them, if they should still do wickedly. Thus, as a faithful watchman, he gave them warning, and so delivered his own soul. If we consider what great things the Lord hath done for us, especially in the great work of redemption, we can neither want motive, encouragement, nor assistance in serving him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wheat harvest - Between May 15 and June 15.

Is it not wheat harvest to-day?&#8212;That season in Palestine occurs at the end of June or beginning of July, when it seldom or never rains, and the sky is serene and cloudless. There could not, therefore, have been a stronger or more appropriate proof of a divine mission than the phenomenon of rain and thunder happening, without any prognostics of its approach, upon the prediction of a person professing himself to be a prophet of the Lord, and giving it as an attestation of his words being true. The people regarded it as a miraculous display of divine power, and, panic-struck, implored the prophet to pray for them. Promising to do so, he dispelled their fears. The conduct of Samuel, in this whole affair of the king's appointment, shows him to have been a great and good man who sank all private and personal considerations in disinterested zeal for his country's good and whose last words in public were to warn the people, and their king, of the danger of apostasy and disobedience to God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Who had such great power and favour with God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Samuel called unto the Lord,.... Not in an authoritative way, or by way of command, but by prayer; so the Targum renders the clause in the preceding verse,"I will pray before the Lord:" <p>and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day; immediately, though there was no appearance of it; it was harvest time, and a fine harvest day. Josephus says (p) he sent thunder, lightning, and hail, a terrible storm and tempest it was: <p>and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel; the Lord that sent this tempest, and Samuel who had such power with God in prayer. Clement of Alexandria (q) thinks that from hence the Greeks borrowed their fable concerning Aeacus invoking God, when there was a drought in Greece; and as soon as he prayed, immediately there was thunder, and the whole air was covered with clouds; but perhaps they rather framed it from the instance of Elijah praying for rain (r), at whose request it came, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42</a>. <p>(p) Antiqu. l. 6. c. 5. sect. 6.

Naturally, therefore, this storm deeply impressed the minds of the people. Though not in itself miraculous, the circumstances made it so. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first proof of this was furnished by the deliverance of the children of Israel out of Egypt, and their safe guidance into Canaan ("this place" is the land of Canaan). The second was to be found in the deliverance of the people out of the power of their foes, to whom the Lord had been obliged to give them up on account of their apostasy from Him, through the judges whom He had raised up for them, as often as they turned to Him with penitence and cried to Him for help. Of the hostile oppressions which overtook the Israelites during this period of the judges, the following are singled out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-9.htm">1 Samuel 12:9</a> : (1) that by Sisera, the commander-in-chief of Hazor, i.e., that of the Canaanitish king Jabin of Hazor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>.); (2) that of the Philistines, by which we are to understand not so much the hostilities of that nation described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>, as the forty years' oppression mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-2.htm">Judges 10:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>; and (3) the Moabitish oppression under Eglon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>.). The first half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-10.htm">Judges 13:10</a> agrees almost word for word with <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-10.htm">Judges 10:10</a>, except that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>, the Ashtaroth are added to the Baalim (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>). Of the judges whom God sent to the people as deliverers, the following are named, viz., Jerubbaal (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>), i.e., Gideon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>), and Bedan, and Jephthah (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>), and Samuel. There is no judge named Bedan mentioned either in the book of Judges or anywhere else. The name Bedan only occurs again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-17.htm">1 Chronicles 7:17</a>, among the descendants of Machir the Manassite: consequently some of the commentators suppose Jair of Gilead to be the judge intended. But such a supposition is perfectly arbitrary, as it is not rendered probable by any identity in the two names, and Jair is not described as having delivered Israel from any hostile oppression. Moreover, it is extremely improbable that Samuel should have mentioned a judge here, who had been passed over in the book of Judges on account of his comparative insignificance. There is also just as little ground for rendering Bedan as an appellative, e.g., the Danite (ben-Dan), as Kimchi suggests, or corpulentus as Bttcher maintains, and so connecting the name with Samson. There is no other course left, therefore, than to regard Bedan as an old copyist's error for Barak (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>), as the lxx, Syriac, and Arabic have done, - a conclusion which is favoured by the circumstance that Barak was one of the most celebrated of the judges, and is placed by the side of Gideon and Jephthah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a>. The Syriac, Arabic, and one Greek MS (see Kennicott in the Addenda to his Dissert. Gener.), have the name of Samson instead of Samuel. But as the lxx, Chald., and Vulg. all agree with the Hebrew text, there is no critical ground for rejecting Samuel, the more especially as the objection raised to it, viz., that Samuel would not have mentioned himself, is far too trivial to overthrow the reading supported by the most ancient versions; and the assertion made by Thenius, that Samuel does not come down to his own times until the following verse, is altogether unfounded. Samuel could very well class himself with the deliverers of Israel, for the simple reason that it was by him that the people were delivered from the forty years' tyranny of the Philistines, whilst Samson merely commenced their deliverance and did not bring it to completion. Samuel appears to have deliberately mentioned his own name along with those of the other judges who were sent by God, that he might show the people in the most striking manner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>) that they had no reason whatever for saying to him, "Nay, but a king shall reign over us," as soon as the Ammonites invaded Gilead. "As Jehovah your God is your king," i.e., has ever proved himself to be your King by sending judges to deliver you. </body></html>
