Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God's protection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make up matters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whose hearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers who prophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse and impression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct the steps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to him for direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance. Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observed turns of Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It is called a trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling they could not resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came at once from the hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make it tremble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is remarkable that the epithet "uncircumcised," used as a term of reproach, is confined almost exclusively to the Philistines. (Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm">1 Samuel 17:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-3.htm">Judges 14:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-18.htm">Judges 15:18</a>, etc.) This is probably an indication of the long oppression of the Israelites by the Philistines and of their frequent wars. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. it may be that the Lord will work for us&#8212;This expression did not imply a doubt; it signified simply that the object he aimed at was not in his own power&#8212;but it depended upon God&#8212;and that he expected success neither from his own strength nor his own merit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said Jonathan, behold, we will pass over to these men,....

To these words, which introduce the occurrences that followed, there are attached from &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493; to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-5.htm">1 Samuel 14:5</a> a series of sentences introduced to explain the situation, and the thread of the narrative is resumed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a> by a repetition of Jonathan's words. It is first of all observed that Jonathan did not disclose his intentions to his father, who would hardly have approved of so daring an enterprise. Then follows a description of the place where Saul was stationed with the six hundred men, viz., "at the end of Gibeah (i.e., the extreme northern end), under the pomegranate-tree (Rimmon) which is by Migron." Rimmon is not the rock Rimmon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45</a>), which was on the north-east of Michmash, but is an appellative noun, signifying a pomegranate-tree. Migron is a locality with which we are not acquainted, upon the north side of Gibeah, and a different place from the Migron which was on the north or north-west of Michmash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a>). Gibeah (Tuleil el Phul) was an hour and a quarter from Geba, and from the pass which led across to Michmash. Consequently, when Saul was encamped with his six hundred men on the north of Gibeah, he may have been hardly an hour's journey from Geba.</body></html>
