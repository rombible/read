This war is related with some detail in the next chapter, but it is there introduced on account of other considerations. The English translators in their rendering, “he gathered an host,” have followed the Syriac and Vulg.; the marginal translation, “he wrought mightily,” is the more accurate.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:47-52 Here is a general account of Saul's court and camp. He had little reason to be proud of his royal dignity, nor had any of his neighbours cause to envy him, for he had but little enjoyment after he took the kingdom. And often men's earthly glory makes a blaze just before the dark night of disgrace and woe comes on them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>. The preceding narrative shows that before this time Saul had been king in name only, since his country was occupied by the Philistines, and he could only muster 600 men, and those but half armed and pent up in a narrow stronghold. Now, however, on the expulsion of the Philistines from his country, and the return of the Israelites from their vassalage and from their hiding places <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-21.htm">1 Samuel 14:21-22</a>, Saul became king in deed as well as in name, and acted the part of a king through the rest of his reign in defending his people against their enemies round about. A comprehensive list of these enemies, including the Ammonite war which had already been described <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-15</a>, and the Amalekite war which follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47-48</a>. There is not the slightest indication from the words whether this "taking the kingdom" occurred soon or really years after Saul's anointing at Gilgal. Hence, some would place the clause <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47-52</a> immediately after <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-15</a>, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12.htm">1 Samuel 12</a>, as a summary of Saul's reign. The details of the reign, namely, of the Philistine war in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13</a>; 14, of the Amalekite war in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, and the other events down to the end of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-13</a>, preceded by the formulary, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a>, would then follow according to the common method of Hebrew historical narrative.<p>Zobah - This was one of the petty Ara-roman kingdoms flourishing at this time (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-12</a> title).

One portion of these additions is also found in the text of our present Vulgate, and reads as follows: Et dixit Saul ad Dominum Deum Israel: Domine Deus Israel, da indicium! quid est quod non responderis servo tuo hodie? Si in me aut in Jonathan filio meo est iniquitas, da ostensionem; aut si haec iniquitas est in populo tuo, da sanctitatem. Et deprehensus est Jonathas et Saul, populus autem exivit. The beginning and end of this verse, as well as v. 42, agree here most accurately with the Hebrew text. But the words from quid est quod to da sanctitatem are interpolated, so that &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1492; are translated twice; first in the words da indicium, and then in the interpolation da ostensionem. This repetition of the same words, and that in different renderings, when taken in connection with the agreement of the Vulgate with the Hebrew text at the beginning and end of the verse, shows clearly enough, that the interpolated clauses did not originate with Jerome, but are simply inserted in his translation from the Itala. The additions of the lxx, in which &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#837; is evidently only a distortion of &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, are regarded by Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 48) and Thenius as an original portion of the text which has dropped out from the Masoretic text. They therefore infer, that instead of &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; we ought to read &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (Thummim), and that we have here the full formula used in connection with the use of the Urim and Thummim, from which it may be seen, that this mode of divine revelation consisted simply in a sacred lot, or in the use of two dice, the one of which was fixed upon at the outset as meaning no, and the other as meaning yes. So much at any rate is indisputable, that the Septuagint translator took &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of thummim, and so assumed that Saul had the guilty person discovered by resorting to the Urim and Thummim. But this assumption is also decidedly erroneous, together with all the inferences based upon it. For, in the first place, the verbs &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; and &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491; can be proved to be never used throughout the whole of the Old Testament to signify the use of the Urim and Thummim, and to be nothing more than technical expressions used to denote the casting of a simple lot (see the passages cited above in the text). Moreover, such passages as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-23.htm">1 Samuel 2:23</a>, show most unmistakeably that the divine oracle of the Urim and Thummim did not consist merely in a sacred lot with yes and no, but that God gave such answers through it as could never have been given through the lots. The Septuagint expansions of the text are nothing more, therefore, than a subjective and really erroneous interpretation on the part of the translators, which arose simply from the mistaken idea that &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; was thummim, and which is therefore utterly worthless.)</body></html>
