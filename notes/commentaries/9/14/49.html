It is supposed to be the same as the Abinadab mentioned in that battle. His two daughters, Merab and Michal, are speciallynamed, probably owing to their connection with the history of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/18-17.htm" title="And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.">1Samuel 18:17-21</a>), the elder of them having been promised to him in marriage, and the younger being actually wedded to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm" title="Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:">1 Samuel 14:49</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Ishui — </span>Called also Abinadab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-2.htm" title="And the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.">1 Samuel 31:2</a>.
