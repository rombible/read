Such is the nature of our bodies, that daily work cannot be done without daily bread, which therefore our Father in heaven graciously gives. Saul was turning aside from God, and now he begins to build altars, being then most zealous, as many are, for the form of godliness when he was denying the power of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hath troubled - The same word as was applied to Achan <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>, and gave its name to the valley of Achor.

The people of the land, as the Targum, the soldiers in his army; afflicted and distressed them, and made them uneasy in their minds, like troubled waters; the Arabic version is,"my father hath sinned against the people;''hath done them injury by forbidding them to eat. This was not wisely said by Jonathan; how much soever his father was to be blamed, it did not become him as a son thus to reflect upon him, and it might have tended to mutiny and sedition: <p>see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey; the benefit he received by it was very visible; it might easily be discerned that he was greatly refreshed with it, and his spirits invigorated by it; it was to be seen in the cheerfulness of his countenance, and the briskness of his eyes: and he suggests it would have had the same effect upon the people, had they eaten of it, as he had done. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said Jonathan, My father hath <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</span><p>(o) By making this cruel law.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">hath troubled</span>] The word applied to Achan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm" title="And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? the LORD shall trouble you this day.

Bethaven was on the east of Michmash, and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-31.htm">1 Samuel 14:31</a>, the Philistines fled westwards from Michmash to Ajalon. But if we bear in mind that the camp of the Philistines was on the eastern side of Michmash before Bethaven, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, and that the Israelites forced their way into it from the south, we shall see that the battle might easily have spread out beyond Bethaven, and that eventually the main body of the enemy might have fled as far as Ajalon, and have been pursued to that point by the victorious Israelites. </body></html>
