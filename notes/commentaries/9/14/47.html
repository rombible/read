It is, however, better to consider the statement contained in this verse as simply a general view of Saul’s reign, which was a reign of perpetual wars. The words, then, of our verse are simply introductory to the list of wars waged from the very beginning of his government. It should be observed that this view is supported by the mention of the Ammonite war, which took place a considerable time before the events just related. Such a mention would, therefore, be out of place, unless we take this verse as containing a general statement—in other words, “Saul assumed the reins of government, and during his reign he waged the following wars.”<p><span class= "bld">On every side . . . Moab . . . Ammon . . . Edom . . . Zobah . . . Philistines.</span>—This enumeration of the nations with whom he fought literally included the countries on every side of the Land of Promise. Moab and Ammon bounded the Israelites on the east; Edom on the south; the Philistines on the west, along the coast of the Mediterranean; while Zobah was a district of Syria on the north-east of the territory of the twelve tribes, lying between the Euphrates and the Syrian Orontes.<p><span class= "bld">He vexed them.</span>—The exact sense of the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">yar’shia, </span>rendered in our version “he vexed,” has puzzled all commentators. The LXX. evidently read another word here, as they translate it by <span class= "ital">esōzeto, </span>“he was preserved.” The majority of the versions and Gesenius, however, give the real sense: “Whithersoever he (Saul) turned himself <span class= "ital">lie was victorious.” </span>Luther’s rendering is scholarly: “Whithersoever he turned <span class= "ital">he inflicted punishment,” </span>and is adopted by Keil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them....">1 Samuel 14:47-48</a></span>. <span class="ital">Saul took the kingdom — </span>That is, resumed the administration of it, after he had, in a manner, lost it by the Philistines, who had almost got the entire possession of it, and enslaved Israel. <span class="ital">And fought against all his enemies on every side — </span>He did not invade them, as may be gathered from the next verse, but repelled them, and kept them within their own limits.

The preceding narrative shows that before this time Saul had been king in name only, since his country was occupied by the Philistines, and he could only muster 600 men, and those but half armed and pent up in a narrow stronghold. Now, however, on the expulsion of the Philistines from his country, and the return of the Israelites from their vassalage and from their hiding places <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-21.htm">1 Samuel 14:21-22</a>, Saul became king in deed as well as in name, and acted the part of a king through the rest of his reign in defending his people against their enemies round about. A comprehensive list of these enemies, including the Ammonite war which had already been described <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-15</a>, and the Amalekite war which follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47-48</a>. There is not the slightest indication from the words whether this "taking the kingdom" occurred soon or really years after Saul's anointing at Gilgal. Hence, some would place the clause <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47-52</a> immediately after <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-15</a>, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12.htm">1 Samuel 12</a>, as a summary of Saul's reign.

Summary account of Saul’s wars and family<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">47</span>. <span class="ital">So Saul took the kingdom</span>] The various wars undertaken by Saul whom the people elected king “to go out before them and fight their battles” are here summarily noticed. (1) Against Moab. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm" title="Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.">1 Samuel 11:1</a>. (2) Against the children of Ammon, as recorded in ch. 11, and perhaps upon other occasions. (3) Against the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, surnamed Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-30.htm" title="And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.">Genesis 25:30</a>), who occupied Edom or Idumaea, previously called Mount Seir (= <span class="ital">rugged</span>), the mountainous district stretching from the Dead Sea to the head of the Gulf of Elath. The Edomites were conquered by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm" title="And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2 Samuel 8:14</a>), and remained subject to Judah till the reign of Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm" title="In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.">2 Kings 8:20</a>). They are fiercely denounced by the later prophets, especially Obadiah, for their hostility to Judah. (4) Against the Syrian kingdom of Zobah on the north-east. This kingdom was probably situated between Damascus and the Euphrates, but its exact position and limits are undetermined. The “kings” were apparently independent chiefs; in David’s time it was ruled by a single king Hadadezer, and the account of David’s wars with it testify to its power and importance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/8-3.htm" title="David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates....">2 Samuel 8:3-10</a>). (5) Against the Philistines throughout his reign (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-52.htm" title="And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.">1 Samuel 14:52</a></span>). No special account of the wars against Moab, Edom and Zobah is given, for the object of the book is not to give a complete history of Saul’s reign, but to describe its salient features, and the sins which led to his rejection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he vexed them</span>] The word means literally “to condemn,” and so (if the reading is correct) “to conquer,” the war being regarded as a suit against the enemies of God, in which defeat was tantamount to a verdict of condemnation. The Sept. however reads simply, “he was victorious.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Saul took the kingdom.</span> Instead of <span class="accented">so</span> the Hebrew has <span class="accented">and</span>, rightly; for this is no result or consequence of Saul's victory over the Philistines, but a mere historical introduction to the summary of his wars. The more correct translation would be, "When Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought," etc. Saul's reign was valiant and full of military glory. He was, in fact, in war all that the people had longed for, and not only. did he gain independence for Israel.. but laid the foundation of the vast empire of David and Solomon. But it is not the purpose of Holy, Scripture to give us the history of all Saul s valiant exploits, but only of his moral probation and failure. Of wars we read more than enough in profane history; here we read of the formation of character, and how a hero in the midst of noble and worthy feats of arms may yet lose something nobler and worthier - the favour of God. On every side. Moab and Ammon were on the east, Edom on the south, Zobah on the northeast, and the Philistines on the west. Zobah lay beyond Damascus, and, from the accounts given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, must have been a powerful state. <span class="cmt_word">He vexed them.</span> The verb is a judicial one, used of punishing the guilty, and might be translated "he chastised them."
