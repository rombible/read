Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God's protection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make up matters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whose hearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers who prophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse and impression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct the steps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to him for direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance. Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observed turns of Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It is called a trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling they could not resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came at once from the hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make it tremble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Under a pomegranate - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>.

Saul was stationed probably at the northern extremity of it, under “<span class="bld">the</span> pomegranate tree which is in Migron.” So we find him afterwards “under the tamarisk in Gibeah” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-6.htm" title="When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul stayed in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)">1 Samuel 22:6</a>). <span class="ital">Migron</span> cannot be the place mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm" title="He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:">Isaiah 10:28</a>, which was north of Michmash.

Saul evidently shared to the full in the love of trees common among the Israelites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a>). The Hebrew word for pomegranate is Rimmon, but there is no doubt that the tree is here meant, and not the rock Rimmon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45, 47</a>), so called probably from a fancied resemblance to the fruit. <span class="cmt_word">Migron</span>, said to mean a <span class="accented">cliff</span> was apparently a common name for localities in this mountainous district, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a> we read of one lying to the north of Michmash, whereas this is to the south. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Israelites could not offer a successful resistance to these devastating raids, as there was no smith to be found in the whole land: "For the Philistines thought the Hebrews might make themselves sword or spear" (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; followed by &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, "to say, or think, that not," equivalent to being unwilling that it should be done). Consequently (as the words clearly imply) when they proceeded to occupy the land of Israel as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, they disarmed the people throughout, i.e., as far as they penetrated, and carried off the smiths, who might have been able to forge weapons; so that, as is still further related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-20.htm">1 Samuel 13:20</a>, all Israel was obliged to go to the Philistines, every one to sharpen his edge-tool, and his ploughshare, and his axe, and his chopper. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>, &#1488;&#1514; is an iron instrument used in agriculture; the majority of the ancient versions render it ploughshare. The word &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; is striking after the previous &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; (from &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;); and the meaning of both words is uncertain. According to the etymology, &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; might denote any kind of edge-tool, even the ploughshare. The second &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; is rendered &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (his sickle) by the lxx, and sarculum by Jerome, a small garden hoe for loosening and weeding the soil. The fact that the word is connected with &#1511;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, the axe or hatchet, favours the idea that it signifies a hoe or spade rather than a sickle. Some of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a> are still more obscure. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, which is the reading adopted by all the earlier translators, indicates that the result is about to be given of the facts mentioned before: "And there came to pass," i.e., so that there came to pass (or arose), &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, "a blunting of the edges." &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, bluntness, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;, to tear, hence to make blunt, is confirmed by the Arabic futa&#770;r, gladius fissuras habens, obtusus ensis, whereas the meaning to hammer, i.e., to sharpen by hammering, cannot be established. The insertion of the article before &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is as striking as the omission of it before &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; also the stat. abs. instead of the construct &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514;. These anomalies render it a very probable conjecture that the reading may have been &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; (inf. Hiph. nomin.). Accordingly the rendering would be, "so that bluntness of the edges occurred in the edge-tools, and the ploughshares, and the trident, and the axes, and the setting of the goad." &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473; is to be regarded as a nom. comp. like our trident, denoting an instrument with three prongs, according to the Chaldee and the Rabbins (see Ges. Thes. p. 1219). &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;, stimulus, is probably a pointed instrument generally, since the meaning goad is fully established in the case of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>.<p>(Note: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a> runs very differently in the lxx, namely, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#894; and Thenius and Bttcher propose an emendation of the Hebrew text accordingly, so as to obtain the following meaning: "And the sharpening of the edges in the case of the spades and ploughshares was done at three shekels a tooth (i.e., three shekels each), and for the axe and sickle it was the same" (Thenius); or, "and the same for the sickles, and for the axes, and for setting the prong" (Bttcher). But here also it is easy enough to discover that the lxx had not another text before them that was different from the Masoretic text, but merely confounded &#1492;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1492;&#1489;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and took &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, which was unintelligible to them, e conjectura for &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, altogether regardless of the sense or nonsense of their own translation. The latest supporters of this senseless rendering, however, have neither undertaken to prove the possibility of translating &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;), "each single piece" (i.e., each), or inquired into the value of money at that time, so as to see whether three shekels would be an unexampled charge for the sharpening of an axe or sickle.) </body></html>
