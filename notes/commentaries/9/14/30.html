Such is the nature of our bodies, that daily work cannot be done without daily bread, which therefore our Father in heaven graciously gives. Saul was turning aside from God, and now he begins to build altars, being then most zealous, as many are, for the form of godliness when he was denying the power of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hath troubled - The same word as was applied to Achan <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>, and gave its name to the valley of Achor.

Nevertheless, the pursuit was continued as far as the pass of Aijalon, and though, owing to the increasing weariness of the people, but few of the Philistines were overtaken, nevertheless it would compel them to throw away their arms, and abandon all the booty which they had collected.

The men of Israel were pressed (i.e., fatigued) on that day, sc., through the military service and fighting. Then Saul adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the man that eateth bread until the evening, and (till) I have avenged myself upon mine enemies." &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, fut. apoc. of &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, from &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, to swear, Hiphil to adjure or require an oath of a person. The people took the oath by saying "amen" to what Saul had uttered. This command of Saul did not proceed from a proper attitude towards the Lord, but was an act of false zeal, in which Saul had more regard to himself and his own kingly power than to the cause of the kingdom of Jehovah, as we may see at once from the expression &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "till I have avenged myself upon mine enemies."

All the people kept the command. "They tasted no bread." &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1506;&#1501; is not to be connected with &#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as an apodosis.</body></html>
