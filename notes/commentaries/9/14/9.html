Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God's protection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make up matters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whose hearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers who prophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse and impression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct the steps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to him for direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance. Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observed turns of Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It is called a trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling they could not resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came at once from the hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make it tremble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is remarkable that the epithet "uncircumcised," used as a term of reproach, is confined almost exclusively to the Philistines. (Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm">1 Samuel 17:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-3.htm">Judges 14:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-18.htm">Judges 15:18</a>, etc.) This is probably an indication of the long oppression of the Israelites by the Philistines and of their frequent wars. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. if they say, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand&#8212;When Jonathan appears here to prescribe a sign or token of God's will, we may infer that the same spirit which inspired this enterprise suggested the means of its execution, and put into his heart what to ask of God.

Ahiah is generally supposed to be the same person as Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>.), in which case Ahiah (&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, brother, i.e., friend of Jehovah) would be only another form of the name Ahimelech (i.e., brother or friend of the King, viz., Jehovah). This is very probable, although Ahimelech might have been Ahaiah's brother, who succeeded him in the office of high priest on account of his having died without sons, since there is an interval of at least ten years between the events related in this chapter and those referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22</a>. Ahimelech was afterwards slain by Saul along with the priests of Nob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>.); the only one who escaped being his son Abiathar, who fled to David and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>, was invested with the ephod. It follows, therefore, that Ahiah (or Ahimelech) must have had a son at least ten years old at the time of the war referred to here, viz., the Abiathar mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>, and must have been thirty or thirty-five years old himself, since Saul had reigned at least twenty-two years, and Abiathar had become high priest a few years before the death of Saul. These assumptions may be very easily reconciled with the passage before us. As Eli was ninety-eight years old when he died, his son Phinehas, who had been killed in battle a short time before, might have been sixty or sixty-five years old, and have left a son of forty years of age, namely Ahitub. Forty years later, therefore, i.e., at the beginning of Saul's reign, Ahitub's son Ahiah (Ahimelech) might have been about fifty years old; and at the death of Ahimelech, which took place ten or twelve years after that, his son Abiathar might have been as much as thirty years of age, and have succeeded his father in the office of high priest. But Abiathar cannot have been older than this when his father died, since he was high priest during the whole of David's forty years' reign, until Solomon deposed him soon after he ascended the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>.). Compare with this the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>. Jonathan had also refrained from telling the people anything about his intentions, so that they did not know that he had gone.</body></html>
