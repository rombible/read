Such is the nature of our bodies, that daily work cannot be done without daily bread, which therefore our Father in heaven graciously gives.

To Jonathan, who might direct and encourage the people to do as he had done, at least so he did by his example, if not by words; the latter is not improbable: and therefore one of the men that came along with Saul, and had now joined Jonathan, and who heard what Saul had said, replied: <p>thy father straitly charged the people with an oath; gave them a strict charge, with an oath or imprecation annexed to it: <p>saying, cursed be the man that eateth any food this day; that is, until the evening, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a>. <p>and the people were faint; which is either the observation of the writer of the book; or it may be the words of the man, imputing the faintness of the people to this adjuration of Saul restraining them from food; or as taking notice how strictly the people observed it, though they were hungry, faint, and weary. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day.

It makes, perhaps, the better sense if regarded as the continuation of the history, and inserted to justify Jonathan's disapproval of his father's hasty command.

Those Israelites whom the Philistines had incorporated into their army are called Hebrews, according to the name which was current among foreigners, whilst those who were with Saul are called Israel, according to the sacred name of the nation. The difficulty which many expositors have found in the word &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; has been very correctly solved, so far as the sense is concerned, by the earlier translators, by the interpolation of "they returned:" &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; (Chald.), &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; (lxx), reversi sunt (Vulg.), and similarly the Syriac and Arabic. We are not at liberty, however, to amend the Hebrew text in this manner, as nothing more is omitted than the finite verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; before the infinitive &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; (for this construction, see Gesenius, Gramm. 132, 3, Anm. 1), and this might easily be left out here, since it stands at the beginning of the verse in the main clause. The literal rendering would be, they were to be with Israel, i.e., they came over to Israel. The fact that the Hebrews who were serving in the army of the Philistines came over to Saul and his host, and turned their weapons against their oppressors, naturally heightened the confusion in the camp of the Philistines, and accelerated their defeat; and this was still further increased by the fact that the Israelites who had concealed themselves on the mountains of Ephraim also joined the Israelitish army, as soon as they heard of the flight of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-22.htm">1 Samuel 14:22</a>).</body></html>
