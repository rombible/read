So the battle rolled westward through Beth-aven, past city and village, over Mount Ephraim. It was a decisive victory, crushing in its results to the Philistines, who were driven back so effectually as not to re-appear till the close of Saul’s reign. The king was now at liberty to develop the military character of the people; and till the disaster which closed his life and reign, his various campaigns against the idolatrous nations who surrounded Israel generally appear to have gone on from victory to victory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-23.htm" title="So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over to Bethaven.">1 Samuel 14:23</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord saved Israel that day — </span>Their deliverance was evidently effected by him, and that by means very extraordinary, and such as could have produced no such effect without his almighty power working thereby. <span class="ital">The battle passed over unto Beth-aven — </span>That is, the warriors that were engaged in the battle, and were pursuing the Philistines.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:16-23 The Philistines were, by the power of God, set against one another. The more evident it was that God did all, the more reason Saul had to inquire whether God would give him leave to do any thing. But he was in such haste to fight a fallen enemy, that he would not stay to end his devotions, nor hear what answer God would give him. He that believeth, will not make such haste, nor reckon any business so urgent, as not to allow time to take God with him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Assembled themselves - See marg.
