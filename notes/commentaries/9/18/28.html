His daughter’s love, too, for the rising soldier contributed to his trouble. Saul felt that all that David undertook prospered—that surely another and a higher Power was helping him. So his fear grew, we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-29.htm" title="And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.">1Samuel 18:29</a>, and the paroxysms of jealous hatred deepened into a lifelong enmity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/18-28.htm" title="And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him....">1 Samuel 18:28-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">Saul knew that the Lord was with David — </span>He was convinced of it, by the success which he constantly had in all his undertakings. <span class="ital">And Saul was yet the more afraid of David — </span>Having thus advanced him; and seeing no hope of bringing his designs to pass against him. <span class="ital">And Saul became David’s enemy continually — </span>He was every day more resolved to destroy him. Such strange blindness did his anger and hatred, and such like passions, bring upon him, that he set himself against him, who he saw and knew, had God for his friend! In what a lost condition must Saul’s mind have now been!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:12-30 For a long time David was kept in continual apprehension of falling by the hand of Saul, yet he persevered in meek and respectful behaviour towards his persecutor. How uncommon is such prudence and discretion, especially under insults and provocations! Let us inquire if we imitate this part of the exemplary character before us. Are we behaving wisely in all our ways? Is there no sinful omission, no rashness of spirit, nothing wrong in our conduct? Opposition and perverseness in others, will not excuse wrong tempers in us, but should increase our care, and attention to the duties of our station. Consider Him that endured contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds, Heb 12:3. If David magnified the honour of being son-in-law to king Saul, how should we magnify the honour of being sons to the King of kings!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The days were not expired - David was so rapid in his attack upon the Philistines that he was able to bring the required dowry within the time, and to receive his wife (Michal), before the time had expired within which he was to receive Merab. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

This he perceived by the favour he gave him among men, by overruling all the steps Saul took to do him hurt, for his good, and in giving him success in all that he engaged in; the Targum is,"that the Word of the Lord was for the help of David:" <p>and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him; and therefore could entertain no hope of making use of her as an instrument of his ruin, but, on the contrary, would, out of her great affection to her husband, betray the designs of her father against him, and do all she could to preserve him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">that Michal Saul’s daughter loved him</span>] The reading of the Sept. certainly suits the context better: “that all Israel loved him.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - The failure of his evil purpose, and the knowledge that Michal loved her husband, and would protect him against his intrigues, and that the marriage had brought rank and influence to David, made Saul hate him all the more bitterly, because he could not now openly put to death one so closely connected with him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Saul therefore employed his courtiers to persuade David to accept his offer. In this way we may reconcile in a very simple manner the apparent discrepancy, that Saul is said to have offered his daughter to David himself, and yet he commissioned his servants to talk to David privately of the king's willingness to give him his daughter. The omission of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-21.htm">1 Samuel 18:21</a> in the Septuagint is to be explained partly from the fact that &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17-19</a>, which are wanting in this version, and partly also in all probability from the idea entertained by the translators that the statement itself is at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-22.htm">1 Samuel 18:22</a>. The courtiers were to talk to David &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, "in private," i.e., as though they were doing it behind the king's back.</body></html>
