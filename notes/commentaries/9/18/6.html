Evidently a series of victories after the fall of the dreaded champion—perhaps spread over a very considerable period—had for a time restored the supremacy of Israel in Canaan. In this war, David, on whom after his great feat of arms the eyes of all the soldiery were fixed, established his character for bravery and skill.<p><span class= "bld">Singing and dancing.</span>—This was on some grand occasion—probably the final triumph at the end of the war. The <span class= "ital">Speaker’s Commentary, </span>on the English rendering “singing and dancing,” remarks that “the Hebrew text is probably here corrupt, and suggests that for <span class= "ital">vau, ‘</span>and,’ we ought to read <span class= "ital">beth, ‘</span>with’ and that then the sense would be to sing ‘in the dance,’ or ‘with dancing.’ The action was for the women to dance to the sound of the timbrel, and to sing the Epinicium with strophe and antistrophe as they danced and played.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm" title="And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.">Judges 11:34</a>.)<p>We know that music and song were originally closely connected with dancing. David, for instance, when a mighty king, on one great occasion in Jerusalem actually himself performed dances before all the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2Samuel 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2Samuel 6:16</a>).

It is a sign that the Spirit of God is departed from men, if, like Saul, they are peevish, envious, suspicious, and ill-natured. Compare David, with his harp in his hand, aiming to serve Saul, and Saul, with his javelin in his hand, aiming to slay David; and observe the sweetness and usefulness of God's persecuted people, and the barbarity of their persecutors.

This is a characteristic trait of Oriental manners. On the return of friends long absent, and particularly on the return of a victorious army, bands of women and children issue from the towns and villages, to form a triumphal procession, to celebrate the victory, and, as they go along, to gratify the soldiers with dancing, instrumental music, and extempore songs, in honor of the generals who have earned the highest distinction by feats of gallantry. The Hebrew women, therefore, were merely paying the customary gratulations to David as the deliverer of their country, but they committed a great indiscretion by praising a subject at the expense of their sovereign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine; </span> either, first, From some eminent victory obtained by him against the Philistines, though not particularly related, wherein also Saul might be present and concerned. Or rather, secondly, From the slaughter of Goliath, and the other Philistines with him. Against this it is objected, that this song was sung either after David was advanced and employed, as is related <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm" title="And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.">1 Samuel 18:5</a></span>, and therefore not immediately after that great victory; or, before he was so advanced; and then it would have raised Saul’s jealousy and envy, and consequently hindered David’s advancement.

And that this did not hinder David’s preferment, must be ascribed partly to Saul’s policy, who, though he had an eye upon David, and designed to crush him upon a fit occasion; yet saw it necessary for his own reputation, and the encouragement of other men’s valour, and for the satisfaction of Jonathan’s passionate desire, and the just and general expectation of the whole army and people, to give him some considerable preferment for the present; and principally to God’s providence overruling Saul, against his own inclination, and his mistaken interest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of all cities of Israel, </span> i.e. out of all the neighbouring cities, by or through which the victorious army marched. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Singing and dancing, </span> according to the custom of those times and places; of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>"</span>, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm" title="And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.">Judges 11:34</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, as they came,....

The celebration of David’s victory<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">And it came to pass</span>, &c.] The narrative has made a digression to relate the circumstances of David’s permanent reception into Saul’s service, the commencement of the friendship between him and Jonathan, and his ultimate promotion and success. It now goes back to relate the welcome which David received when the army returned in triumph from the successful completion of the Philistine war. Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1 Samuel 18:6</a> is to be read (as it actually stands in the Sept.) in connexion with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-54.htm" title="And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.">1 Samuel 17:54</a>, though some time may have elapsed, during which the army was occupied in following up its first success. The Sept. reads <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1 Samuel 18:6</a></span> thus; “And the dancing women came out of all the cities of Israel to meet <span class="ital">David</span>, with tabrets and rejoicing and cymbals.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the women came out</span>, &c.] To escort the victors home with singing and dancing. Dancing was the usual expression of rejoicing upon occasions of national triumph like the present; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances....">Exodus 15:20-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm" title="And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.">Jdg 11:34</a>; and at religions festivals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm" title="The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with tambourines.">Psalm 68:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-3.htm" title="Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises to him with the tambourine and harp.">Psalm 149:3</a>). These dances were as a rule confined to women—David’s dancing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2 Samuel 6:14</a> was exceptional—and probably resembled the modern Oriental dance, in which the evolutions are extemporaneous, and not confined to any fixed rule, but varied at the pleasure of the leading dancer, who is imitated by the rest of the company.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with tabrets</span>, &c.] The dance was accompanied (1) by the “tabret” or “timbrel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm" title="And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.">Jdg 11:34</a>): i.e. the <span class="ital">hand-drum</span>, an instrument still used by the Arabs, and described as “a hoop (sometimes with pieces of brass fixed in it to make a jingling) over which a piece of parchment is distended. It is beaten with the fingers:”—(2) “with joy:” i.e. jubilant shouts and songs: (3) “with instruments of music;” either “triangles,” or “three-stringed instruments.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine.</span> Or more probably, as in the margin, "of the  Philistines." The allusion is not to the combat with Goliath, but to one of the expeditions referred to in ver. 5, in which David had gained some decisive victory. The women would not have described the slaughter of one champion as the slaying of ten thousand, nor would there have been any contrast between this act and the military enterprises of Saul. Probably he too would have looked with indifference upon this Oriental exaggeration of the daring bravery of a boy; but what galled him was David's continual success in repeated campaigns. <span class="cmt_word">The Philistine</span> means the whole people of that name; and as the war between them and Saul lasted all the days of Saul's life, and was his main kingly work, he saw with envy the rapid growth of David's reputation; and when, after some noble achievement, the women gave David an ovation, and declared in their songs that he had achieved a success ten times as great as Saul, an outburst of ill feeling was the result. Saul suddenly became aware that the young captain on whose shoulders he had devolved the chief labours of the war had supplanted him in the popular estimation, and hatred took the place of the good feeling which he had previously entertained towards him. <span class="cmt_word">The women came out of all cities of Israel...  to meet king Saul.</span> It is evident that this refers to some grand occasion, and probably to the conclusion of a peace between the two nations. The battle in the valley of Elah was probably followed by several years of warfare, during which David developed those great military qualities which made him subsequently the founder of the wide empire over which Solomon reigned. It was unendurable for Saul, himself a great soldier, to find, when the war at last was over, that the people recognised in his lieutenant higher military qualities than they had discovered in himself. <span class="cmt_word">With tabrets.</span> See on 1 Samuel 10:5. <span class="cmt_word">With joy.</span> As this is placed between the names of two instruments of music, it must mean some kind of joyous shouting or singing to the sound of their tabrets. <span class="cmt_word">With instruments of music.</span> Hebrew, with triangles, a very ancient but effective instrument for an outdoor procession accompanied with dancing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David returned "from the slaughter of the Philistine," i.e., after the defeat of Goliath, and when Abner, who probably went as commander to meet the brave hero and congratulate him upon his victory, had brought him to Saul, the king addressed the same question to David, who immediately gave him the information he desired. For it is evident that David said more than is here communicated, viz., "the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite," as we have already observed, from the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1</a>, which presuppose a protracted conversation between Saul and David. The only reason, in all probability, why this conversation has not been recorded, is that it was not followed by any lasting results either for Jesse or David. </body></html>
