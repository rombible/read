How uncommon is such prudence and discretion, especially under insults and provocations! Let us inquire if we imitate this part of the exemplary character before us. Are we behaving wisely in all our ways? Is there no sinful omission, no rashness of spirit, nothing wrong in our conduct? Opposition and perverseness in others, will not excuse wrong tempers in us, but should increase our care, and attention to the duties of our station. Consider Him that endured contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds, Heb 12:3. If David magnified the honour of being son-in-law to king Saul, how should we magnify the honour of being sons to the King of kings!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The days were not expired - David was so rapid in his attack upon the Philistines that he was able to bring the required dowry within the time, and to receive his wife (Michal), before the time had expired within which he was to receive Merab. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

This he did himself, for the verb is singular, and which were an hundred more than required; this he did to show his regard to the orders of Saul, and his obedience to him, and to testify the sincerity of his afflictions to his daughter, for whose sake he risked his life in this expedition, as well as to express his zeal for God, and his country, against their avowed enemies; the Greek version has only one hundred men, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-14.htm">2 Samuel 3:14</a>, <p>and David brought their foreskins; along with him to Saul's court, having taken them off when slain. Josephus says (z) he cut off their heads, and brought them to him, and he makes the number to be six hundred; neither are according to the text, but to make his history more agreeable to the Gentiles, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-21.htm">1 Samuel 18:21</a>; an Arabic writer (a) makes mention of a people, that cut off the genital parts of men, and gave them to their wives for their dowry: <p>and they gave them in full tale to the king; the messengers David sent in with them, even the full tale of two hundred, which were as many more as were demanded: <p>that he might be the king's son in law; being now as desirous of it as the king was: <p>and Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife; which he could not in honour refuse to do, seeing he had performed the condition he had required. David's marriage of the younger sister, when upon various considerations it might have been expected that he should have married the elder, may be an emblem of Christ's espousing the Gentile church, when the Jewish church, her elder sister, is neglected by him, she having rejected him. <p>(z) Antiqu. l. 6. c. 10. sect. 3.((a) Alcamus apud Bochart.

This may be inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-18.htm">1 Samuel 18:18</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-20.htm">1 Samuel 18:20</a>. Michal, the younger daughter of Saul, loved David. When Saul was told this, the thing was quite right in his eyes. He said, "I will give her to him, that she may become a snare to him, and the hand of the Philistines may come upon him" (sc., if he tries to get the price which I shall require a dowry; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-25.htm">1 Samuel 18:25</a>). He therefore said to David, "In a second way (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14</a>) shalt thou become my son-in-law." Saul said this casually to David; but he made no reply, because he had found out the fickleness of Saul, and therefore put no further trust in his words.</body></html>
