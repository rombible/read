This union of souls is from partaking in the Spirit of Christ. Where God unites hearts, carnal matters are too weak to separate them. Those who love Christ as their own souls, will be willing to join themselves to him in an everlasting covenant. It was certainly a great proof of the power of God's grace in David, that he was able to bear all this respect and honour, without being lifted up above measure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was knit with the soul of David - The same forcible phrase occurs of Jacob's love for Benjamin (marginal reference).

Thus in two ways, first as a musician, and now as a soldier, David was forced into those intimate relations with Saul, which ended so tragically. For a while, however, those happier results ensued summed up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan and David made a covenant.</span> We are not to suppose that this happened immediately. David continued on friendly terms with Saul for a considerable period, during which he went on many expeditions, and grew in military renown (see ver. 5). And thus the love which began with admiration of David's prowess grew deeper and more confirmed by constant intercourse, till this solemn bond of mutual friendship was entered into by the two youthful heroes, by which they bound themselves under all circumstances to be true and faithful to one another. How nobly Jonathan kept the bond the history proceeds immediately to tell us; nor was David subsequently unmindful of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>:l, 7). <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan stripped himself of the robe,</span> etc. In confirmation of the bond Jonathan gave David first his <span class="accented">robe</span>, the <span class="accented">meil</span>, which, as we have seen on 1 Samuel 2:19, was the ordinary dress of the wealthier classes; and next <span class="cmt_word">his garments,</span> his military dress (see on 1 Samuel 17:38, 39), worn over the <span class="accented">meil</span>, and which here seems to include his accoutrements, - the bow, sword, and girdle, - though elsewhere distinguished from them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>). In thus clothing David in his own princely equipments Jonathan was showing his friend the greatest personal honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8</a>), and such a gift is still highly esteemed in the East. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But David took the head of Goliath and brought it to Jerusalem, and put his armour in his tent. &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; is an antiquated term for a dwelling-place, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>, etc. The reference is to David's house at Bethlehem, to which he returned with the booty after the defeat of Goliath, and that by the road which ran past Jerusalem, where he left the head of Goliath. There is no anachronism in these statements; for the assertion made by some, that Jerusalem was not yet in the possession of the Israelites, rests upon a confusion between the citadel of Jebus upon Zion, which was still in the hands of the Jebusites, and the city of Jerusalem, in which Israelites had dwelt for a long time (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>). Nor is there any contradiction between this statement and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>, where Goliath's sword is said to have been preserved in the tabernacle at Nob: for it is not affirmed that David kept Goliath's armour in his own home, but only that he took it thither; and the supposition that Goliath's sword was afterwards deposited by him in the sanctuary in honour of the Lord, is easily reconcilable with this. Again, the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-2.htm">1 Samuel 18:2</a>, to the effect that, after David's victory over Goliath, Saul did not allow him to return to his father's house any more, is by no means at variance with this explanation of the verse before us. For the statement in question must be understood in accordance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-15.htm">1 Samuel 17:15</a>, viz., as signifying that from that time forward Saul did not allow David to return to his father's house to keep the sheep as he had done before, and by no means precludes his paying brief visits to Bethlehem. </body></html>
