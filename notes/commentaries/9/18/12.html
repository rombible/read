He looked on such manifestations of bitter hatred as simple outbursts of a temporary insanity. His loyal nature would not believe in the enduring hate of one so great and noble as Saul; but we read here that even when the king recovered from the paroxysm, he <span class= "ital">feared </span>David. Saul was conscious that his old vigour and ability were deserting him, and in David he recognised the presence of a power he knew had once been his. Not being able, even in his sane hours, to endure the presence of one whom he too surely felt would sooner or later take his place, the king dismissed him honourably from the Court, and invested him with an important military charge. Perhaps already the dark thought which some time later (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm" title="And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles.

How uncommon is such prudence and discretion, especially under insults and provocations! Let us inquire if we imitate this part of the exemplary character before us. Are we behaving wisely in all our ways? Is there no sinful omission, no rashness of spirit, nothing wrong in our conduct? Opposition and perverseness in others, will not excuse wrong tempers in us, but should increase our care, and attention to the duties of our station. Consider Him that endured contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds, Heb 12:3.

It is impossible to give the sense of "raving" to the word "prophesied," as though a merely natural state of frenzy were intended. The "prophesying" here was as directly the effect of the coming of the evil spirit upon Saul, as the "prophesying" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a> was the effect of the Spirit of God coming upon him. At the same time it is quite true that "madness" and "prophesyings" were considered as near akin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 18:10-12.

In the present it is used to express that Saul was in a frenzy. David, perceiving the symptoms, hastened, by the soothing strains of his harp, to allay the stormy agitation of the royal mind.

To his jealousy succeeded a sense of powerlessness, as knowing that a higher power was with David, while he had lost the Divine protection. This miserable feeling grew upon the unhappy king, till before the battle of Gilboa we find him with all his old heroic spirit gone, a miserable wreck, seeking for comfort at the hands of a woman of the most worthless kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-5.htm">1 Samuel 28:5, 7, 20</a>). In this despondent state of mind he dismisses David from attendance upon him, but in an honourable manner, giving him the command of a thousand men, at the head of whom <span class="cmt_word">he went out and came in before the people,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a public capacity, as an officer of state. As Saul seems entirely to have neglected the internal administration of the kingdom, this would refer to military expeditions (see on ver. 5); and in these <span class="cmt_word">David behaved himself wisely.</span> Rather, "prospered" (see on ver. 5). His great success only increased Saul's fears; but both <span class="cmt_word">Israel and Judah loved David,</span> now that in this higher command they had full opportunities for judging of his high qualities. Thus again his removal from his place in Saul's bodyguard only served to make him better known. The separate mention of Israel and Judah is an indication of the Books of Samuel having been written at a post-Solomonic date, though the distinction was a very old one (see on 1 Samuel 11:8).

On these grounds, no doubt, the lxx have not only omitted the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a> from their version, but also <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-9.htm">1 Samuel 18:9-11</a>. But the supposed discrepancy between <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-9.htm">1 Samuel 18:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-2.htm">1 Samuel 18:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>, - viz., that Saul could not have kept David by his side from attachment to him, or have placed him over his men of war after several prosperous expeditions, as is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-2.htm">1 Samuel 18:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>, if he had looked upon him with jealous eyes from the very first day, or if his jealousy had broken out on the second day in the way described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-11.htm">1 Samuel 18:11</a>, - is founded upon two erroneous assumptions; viz., (1) that the facts contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1-5</a> were contemporaneous with those in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6-14</a>; and (2) that everything contained in these two sections is to be regarded as strictly chronological. But the fact recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-2.htm">1 Samuel 18:2</a>, namely, that Saul took David to himself, and did not allow him to go back to his father's house any more, occurred unquestionably some time earlier than those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>. with their consequences. Saul took David to himself immediately after the defeat of Goliath, and before the war had been brought to an end. But the celebration of the victory, in which the paean of the women excited jealousy in Saul's mind, did not take place till the return of the people and of the king at the close of the war. How long the war lasted we do not know; but from the fact that the Israelites pursued the flying Philistines to Gath and Ekron, and then plundered the camp of the Philistines after that (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-52.htm">1 Samuel 17:52-53</a>), it certainly follows that some days, if not weeks, must have elapsed between David's victory over Goliath and the celebration of the triumph, after the expulsion of the Philistines from the land. Thus far the events described in the two sections are arranged in their chronological order; but for all the rest the facts are arranged antithetically, according to their peculiar character, whilst the consequences, which reached further than the facts that gave rise to them, and were to some extent contemporaneous, are appended immediately to the facts themselves. Thus David's going out whithersoever Saul sent him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>) may indeed have commenced during the pursuit of the flying Philistines; but it reached far beyond this war, and continued even while Saul was looking upon him with jealous eyes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a> contains a general remark, with which the historian brings to a close one side of the relation between David and Saul, which grew out of David's victory. He then proceeds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a> to give the other side, and rounds off this paragraph also (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14-16</a>) with a general remark, the substance of which resembles, in the main, the substance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>. At the same time it implies some progress, inasmuch as the delight of the people at the acts performed by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>) grew into love to David itself. This same progress is also apparent in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13</a> ("Saul made him captain over a thousand"), as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a> ("Saul set him over the men of war"). Whether the elevation of David into a captain over a thousand was a higher promotion than his appointment over the men of war, or the latter expression is to be taken as simply a more general or indefinite term, denoting his promotion to the rank of commander-in-chief, is a point which can hardly be determined with certainty.)<p> - Saul had no sooner attached the conqueror of Goliath to his court, than he began to be jealous of him. The occasion for his jealousy was the celebration of victory at the close of the war with the Philistines.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6-7</a><p>"When they came," i.e., when the warriors returned with Saul from the war, "when (as is added to explain what follows) David returned from the slaughter," i.e., from the war in which he had slain Goliath, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, "to singing and dancing," i.e., to celebrate the victory with singing and choral dancing (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), "to meet king Saul with tambourines, with joy, and with triangles." &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492;&#1492; is used here to signify expressions of joy, a fte, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a>, etc. The striking position in which the word stands, viz., between two musical instruments, shows that, the word is to be understood here as referring specially to songs of rejoicing, since according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a> their playing was accompanied with singing. The women who "sported" (&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;), i.e., performed mimic dances, sang in alternate choruses ("answered," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>), "Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands." </body></html>
