This union of souls is from partaking in the Spirit of Christ. Where God unites hearts, carnal matters are too weak to separate them. Those who love Christ as their own souls, will be willing to join themselves to him in an everlasting covenant. It was certainly a great proof of the power of God's grace in David, that he was able to bear all this respect and honour, without being lifted up above measure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was knit with the soul of David - The same forcible phrase occurs of Jacob's love for Benjamin (marginal reference).

Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David&#8212;To receive any part of the dress which had been worn by a sovereign, or his eldest son and heir, is deemed, in the East, the highest honor which can be conferred on a subject (see on [245]Es 6:8). The girdle, being connected with the sword and the bow, may be considered as being part of the military dress, and great value is attached to it in the East.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Partly as a pledge of his great respect and affection to him; and partly to vindicate David from that contempt which might cleave to him for his former pastoral habit and condition, and to put him into a habit suitable to his present greatness and glory. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,....

The account of the relation into which David was brought to Saul through the defeat of Goliath is introduced by a supplementary remark, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-56.htm">1 Samuel 17:56</a>, as to a conversation which took place between Saul and his commander-in-chief Abner concerning David, whilst he was fighting with the giant. So far, therefore, as the actual meaning is concerned, the verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-56.htm">1 Samuel 17:56</a> should be rendered as pluperfects. When Saul saw the youth walk boldly up to meet the Philistine, he asked Abner whose son he was; whereupon Abner assured him with an oath that he did not know. In our remarks concerning the integrity of this section we have already observed, with regard to the meaning of the question put by Saul, that it does not presuppose an actual want of acquaintance with the person of David and the name of his father, but only ignorance of the social condition of David's family, with which both Abner and Saul may hitherto have failed to make themselves more fully acquainted.<p>(Note: The common solutions of this apparent discrepancy, such as that Saul pretended not to know David, or that his question is to be explained on the supposition that his disease affected his memory, have but little probability in them, although Karkar still adheres to them.) </body></html>
