It is, however, clear from other notices (see, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-8.htm" title="And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.">1Samuel 11:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-4.htm" title="And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.">1Samuel 15:4</a>, in this book) that at a period long anterior to the final disruption between the north and south a marked distinction between the two had begun to exist.<p>In David’s case, however, although he was of Judah, the future king was equally popular with the northern tribes.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:12-30 For a long time David was kept in continual apprehension of falling by the hand of Saul, yet he persevered in meek and respectful behaviour towards his persecutor. How uncommon is such prudence and discretion, especially under insults and provocations! Let us inquire if we imitate this part of the exemplary character before us. Are we behaving wisely in all our ways? Is there no sinful omission, no rashness of spirit, nothing wrong in our conduct? Opposition and perverseness in others, will not excuse wrong tempers in us, but should increase our care, and attention to the duties of our station. Consider Him that endured contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds, Heb 12:3. If David magnified the honour of being son-in-law to king Saul, how should we magnify the honour of being sons to the King of kings!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He prophesied - This, as the effect of the evil spirit coming upon him, is singular as regards Saul, but is borne out by what we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>. (Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-15.htm">Acts 19:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-3</a>). It is impossible to give the sense of "raving" to the word "prophesied," as though a merely natural state of frenzy were intended. The "prophesying" here was as directly the effect of the coming of the evil spirit upon Saul, as the "prophesying" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a> was the effect of the Spirit of God coming upon him. At the same time it is quite true that "madness" and "prophesyings" were considered as near akin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 18:13-16.

This use of the word is founded upon the ecstatic utterances, in which the supernatural influence of the Spirit of God manifested itself in the prophets (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1496;&#1500;, from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, he hurled the javelin, and said (to himself), "I will pierce David and the wall." With such force did he hurl his spear; but David turned away from him, i.e., eluded it, twice. His doing so a second time presupposes that Saul hurled the javelin twice; that is to say, he probably swung it twice without letting it go out of his hand, - a supposition which is raised into certainty by the fact that it is not stated here that the javelin entered the wall, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>. But even with this view &#1497;&#1496;&#1500; is not to be changed into &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500;, as Thenius proposes, since the verb &#1504;&#1496;&#1500; cannot be proved to have ever the meaning to swing. Saul seems to have held the javelin in his hand as a sceptre, according to ancient custom.</body></html>
