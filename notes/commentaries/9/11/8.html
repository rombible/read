The chronicler, with pardonable exultation, specially mentions the splendid result of the young hero’s first summons to the tribes, adding, with perhaps an undertone of sadness, that the rich and populous Judah to that great host only contributed 30,000. There is no doubt, as Dean Payne Smith well observes, that “as a matter of fact Judah always stood apart until there was a king who belonged to itself. Then, in David’s time, it first took an active interest in the national welfare, and it was its vast power and numbers which made the shepherd-king, who sprang from Judah, so powerful.” In the reign of King Asa of Judah, the numbers of the men of war of that proud tribe amounted to 300,000. It is, however, to be remembered that in the Old Testament Books, owing to the mistakes of copyists, <span class= "ital">numbers </span>are not always to be strictly relied upon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-8.htm" title="And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.">1 Samuel 11:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">The men of Judah thirty thousand — </span>They were numbered apart to their honour, to show how readily they, to whom the kingdom was promised, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>,) submitted to their king, though of another tribe, and how willing they were to hazard themselves for their brethren, although they might have excused themselves from the necessity of defending their own country from their dangerous neighbours the Philistines.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-11 The first fruit of Saul's government was the rescue of Jabesh-gilead from the Ammonites. To save their lives, men will part with liberty, and even consent to have their eyes put out; is it then no wisdom to part with that sin which is as dear to us as our right eye, rather than to be cast into hell-fire? See the faith and confidence of Saul, and, grounded thereon, his courage and resolution. See also his activity in this business. When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon men, it will make them expert, even without experience. When zeal for the glory of God, and love for the brethren, urge men to earnest efforts, and when God is pleased to help, great effects may speedily be produced.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He numbered them - This was done to see who was absent (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-9.htm">Judges 21:9</a>).<p>Bezek has been conjectured to be the name of a district rather than of a town.

Josephus (y) has made a gross mistake in the numbers here, he makes the men of Israel to be 700,000, and the men of Judah 70,000, contrary to the text, the Targum, Syriac and Arabic versions; but the Septuagint comes pretty near him, which has 600,000 of the men of Israel, 70,000 of the men of Judah. <p>(u) Vid.

The separate numbering of Israel and Judah has been taken to mark the date of the book as posterior to the Division of the Kingdom. It may however be only an indication of a tendency on the part of Judah to isolation which was confirmed by the separation in the early part of David’s reign, and prepared the way for the Disruption.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He numbered them in Bezek</span>. This place was in the tribe of Issachar, and must be distinguished from that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3, 4</a>, which was in Judah, and too remote from the scene of operations. And here Saul appears as the commander-in-chief; for the numbering included the forming of battalions, arranged in thousands, hundreds, and fifties, and the setting officers over them. These, naturally, were the chief men in each district. The result would be that, coming to Bezek, the appointed rendezvous, a disorderly multitude, they would leave it as an army arranged in order, and Saul, in the many difficulties that would arise, would have his first opportunity of showing his powers of command. <span class="cmt_word">Children of Israel,...  men of Judah</span> - the distinction which ended in the disruption of the nation. Judah, too, with its 30,000 men, is but poorly represented, nor is it a sufficient explanation of the small number who came that the tribe had enough to do at home in making head against the Philistines. As a matter of fact, Judah always stood apart until there was a king who belonged to itself. Then, in David's time, it first took an active interest in the national welfare, and it was its vast power and numbers which made him so powerful. Had it been so nearly overpowered by the Philistines, it could not so suddenly have sprung forth with a might which made it well nigh a match for all the rest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Nahash replied, "On this condition (&#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, lit. at this price, &#1489;&#1468; pretii) will I make a covenant with you, that I may put out all your right eyes, and so bring a reproach upon all Israel." From the fact that the infinitive &#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512; is continued with &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, it is evident that the subject to &#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512; is Nahash, and not the Israelites, as the Syriac, Arabic, and others have rendered it. The suffix to &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; is neuter, and refers to the previous clause: "it," i.e., the putting out of the right eye. This answer on the part of Nahash shows unmistakeably that he sought to avenge upon the people of Israel the shame of the defeat which Jephthah had inflicted upon the Ammonites.</body></html>
