This royal family was in some way related to David (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.">2Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="Whose sisters were Zeruiah, and Abigail.

At the time of David’s exile owing to the rebellion of Absalom, a son of Nahash the Ammonite is specially mentioned as showing kindness to the fugitive king. Jabesh-gilead was a city situated in Northern Gilead, in the territory assigned to Manasseh. Josephus states that it was the capital of the country of Gilead. The Ammonites were a kindred race to the Moabites, being descended from the same ancestor, the patriarch Lot. They asserted that a portion of their territory had been taken from them by Israel, and in the days of the judges sorely harassed the people. The Judge Jephthah attacked and defeated them with great slaughter.<p>It was, no doubt, to avenge the disgrace they had suffered at the hands of Jephthah that their warlike monarch, Nahash,—deeming the opportunity a favourable one, owing to the old age of the reigning judge, Samuel,—invaded the Israelitic country bordering upon his kingdom, and besieged the city of Jabesh-gilead.<p><span class= "bld">Make a covenant with us.</span>—The citizens of Jabesh-gilead, feeling their isolation and comparative remoteness from the chief centre of the people, were willing to pay a tribute to the Ammonite king, and made him overtures to this effect.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm" title="Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.">1 Samuel 11:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then — </span>That is, about that time; for that this happened before, and was the occasion of their desire of a king, may seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm" title="And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.">1 Samuel 12:12</a>; although it is possible that Nahash’s preparation might cause that desire, and that he did not actually come till their king was chosen. <span class="ital">Will serve — </span>The occasion of this offer was, that they saw no likelihood of relief from their brethren in Canaan.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-11 The first fruit of Saul's government was the rescue of Jabesh-gilead from the Ammonites. To save their lives, men will part with liberty, and even consent to have their eyes put out; is it then no wisdom to part with that sin which is as dear to us as our right eye, rather than to be cast into hell-fire? See the faith and confidence of Saul, and, grounded thereon, his courage and resolution. See also his activity in this business. When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon men, it will make them expert, even without experience.

A month after, as in the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, that is, a month after Saul was chosen king; so Josephus (p): this prince was preparing for war against Israel before, which they hearing of, requested they might have a king to go before them in battle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a> but now he actually marched from his own country, and besieged Jabeshgilead, a city in the land of Gilead, from whence it had its name, and lay in the half tribe of Manasseh, on the other side Jordan, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-8.htm">Judges 21:8</a>. It lay near to the Ammonites, and was part of the country they laid claim to in the times of Jephthah, which they now renewed, and attempted to gain it by force. This Nahash was king of the Ammonites, as he is called in the Targum, and by Josephus (q), and so in the Arabic version, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>. <p>and all the men of Jabeshgilead said unto Nahash, make a covenant with us; they desired to be his allies and confederates, live in peace and friendship with him, and enjoy their religion and liberties on certain conditions they were willing to come into; and this was the sense of them all, or at least the greatest part, which showed a mean and abject spirit in them, to make no defence of themselves, but as soon as besieged to move for a capitulation. This doubtless arose from a sense of their weakness, not being able to hold it out long, and from an apprehension that their brethren the Israelites, on the other side Jordan, could give them no assistance, being in an unsettled condition, having chosen a king, and he scarcely on the throne, and the Philistines having great power over them: <p>and we will serve thee; not as slaves, but as tributaries; they were willing to pay a yearly tax to him. <p>(p) Antiqu. l. 6. c. 5. sect. 1.((q) Ibid. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Nahash the Ammonite <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</span><p>(a) After that Saul was chosen king: for fear of whom they asked a king, as in 1Sa 12:12.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/11-1.htm" title="Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you....">1 Samuel 11:1-11</a>.

The Sept. however omits the words “But he held his peace” at the close of ch. 10, and begins this chapter “And it came to pass after about a month that Nahash, &c.” This rendering represents a very slight variation in the consonants of the Hebrew text, and possibly preserves the original reading. At any rate we may gather from ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm" title="And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.">1 Samuel 12:12</a> that an Ammonite attack was threatened before Saul’s election, and probably the actual invasion took place not long after.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nahash</span>] The king of the Ammonites (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm" title="And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.">1 Samuel 12:12</a>). This Nahash can hardly have been the Nahash who “shewed kindness to David” during his wanderings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-2.htm" title="Then said David, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father.

According to Josephus he was slain in the battle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Ammonite</span>] South and East of the Israelite settlements on the Eastern side of the Jordan dwelt the powerful tribes of the Ammonites and Moabites. The limits of their respective territories cannot be exactly defined, but the Ammonites appear to have lived north and the Moabites south of the Arnon. The Ammonites were a fierce marauding tribe: the Moabites a settled and civilised nation. United by the tie of common descent from Lot, they were generally in alliance against Israel. Twice during the period of the Judges they “oppressed Israel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/3-12.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD....">Jdg 3:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-11.htm" title="And the LORD said to the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?">Jdg 10:11</a>), and even crossed the Jordan and occupied Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-13.htm" title="For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.">1 Samuel 3:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-9.htm" title="And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.">1 Samuel 10:9</a>). After their defeat by Jephthah, the Ammonites are not mentioned until the present occasion. During the early part of David’s reign they were on friendly terms with him, but the studied insult offered by Hanun to his ambassadors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.">2 Samuel 10:1</a> ff.) led to a war which resulted in the capture of their metropolis Rabbah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-26.htm" title="And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.">2 Samuel 12:26</a>). In the reign of Jehoshaphat they once more invaded Judah in conjunction with the Moabites (2 Chronicles 20), but were signally defeated, and became tributary to Uzziah and Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-8.htm" title="And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.">2 Chronicles 26:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-5.htm" title="He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay to him, both the second year, and the third.">2 Chronicles 27:5</a>). Even after the Return their old hostility survived (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/4-7.htm" title="But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,...">Nehemiah 4:7-8</a>). Judas Maccabaeus found them “a mighty power,” and “fought many battles with them until at length they were discomfited before him” (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/5-6.htm" title="Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captain....">1Ma 5:6-7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jabesh-Gilead</span>] i.e. Jabesh <span class="ital">in Gilead</span>, the extensive district lying immediately E. of the Jordan between Bashan on the N. and Moab and Ammon on the S. and S. E. To the southern portion of this district the Ammonites laid claim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-13.htm" title="And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.">Jdg 11:13</a>). A terrible vengeance had been executed on Jabesh for its neglect to join the levy of Israel in the war against Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-8.htm" title="And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.">Jdg 21:8</a> ff.), but from this blow it had recovered, and Nahash now attacked it as the capital of Gilead, and the key to the possession of the country. The name of Jabesh still survives in the <span class="ital">Wady Yâbis</span>, which runs down into the Jordan valley a few miles below Beth-shan. It is a lovely valley, full of straggling old olives, patches of barley, and rich pasture.

He is there said to have shown kindness to David; and as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a> that Abigal (so the Hebrew, not Abigail as the A.V., who was David's wife), Amasa's mother, was the daughter of Nahash, and as Abigal was the sister or half-sister of Zeruiah, David's aunt, there seems to have been some relationship between them. The Ammonites were old enemies of the Israelites, alleging that Israel had taken possession of territory east of the Jordan which rightfully belonged to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13</a>); but after their defeat by Jephthah their power was so broken that they allowed a century to elapse before they ventured again to assert their claim. Nahash, apparently after other invasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>), now attacks Jabesh-Gilead, a city in the half-tribe of Manasseh, which had been cruelly treated by the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-10.htm">Judges 21:10</a>), but apparently had risen again from its ruins. Its inhabitants were willing humbly to submit to Ammonite rule; but Nahash will grant them no other terms than that they should let him <span class="cmt_word">thrust out</span> - Hebrew, bore through - <span class="cmt_word">all their right eyes,</span> not from any special spite against them, but as an insult to all Israel. No better proof could be given of the disorganisation of the nation  than that a petty despot should venture to show his contempt for it in so offensive a way. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then they inquired of Jehovah, "Is any one else come hither?" and Jehovah replied, "Behold, he (whom ye are seeking) is hidden among the things." The inquiry was made through the high priest, by means of the Urim and Thummim, for which &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; was the technical expression, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a> (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, etc.). There can be no doubt, that in a gathering of the people for so important a purpose as the election of a king, the high priest would also be present, even though this is not expressly stated. Samuel presided over the meeting as the prophet of the Lord. The answer given by God, "Behold, he is hidden," etc., appears to have no relation to the question, "Is any one else come?" The Sept. and Vulg. have therefore altered the question into &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;, utrumnam venturus esset; and Thenius would adopt this as an emendation. But he is wrong in doing so; for there was no necessity to ask whether Saul would still come: they might at once have sent to fetch him. What they asked was rather, whether any one else had come besides those who were present, as Saul was not to be found among them, that they might know where they were to look for Saul, whether at home or anywhere else. And to this question God gave the answer, "He is present, only hidden among the things." By &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (the things or vessels, Eng. ver. the stuff) we are to understand the travelling baggage of the people who had assembled at Mizpeh. Saul could neither have wished to avoid accepting the monarchy, nor have imagined that the lot would not fall upon him if he hid himself. For he knew that God had chosen him; and Samuel had anointed him already. He did it therefore simply from humility and modesty. "In order that he might not appear to have either the hope or desire for anything of the kind, he preferred to be absent when the lots were cast" (Seb. Schmidt).</body></html>
