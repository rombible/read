The seer, with striking generosity to one who superseded him in his position as judge, again presented the hero Saul to Israel as their anointed king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-14.htm" title="Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.">1 Samuel 11:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then said Samuel — </span>While the people were together by Jabesh- gilead. <span class="ital">Come, and let us renew the kingdom — </span>That is, confirm our former choice, and more solemnly and unanimously inaugurate Saul for our king.

The calm and sagacious counsel of Samuel directed the popular feelings into a right channel, by appointing a general assembly of the militia, the really effective force of the nation, at Gilgal, where, amid great pomp and religious solemnities, the victorious leader was confirmed in his kingdom [1Sa 11:15].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> whilst the people were together by Jabesh-gilead, wherein Samuel’s great prudence and fidelity to Saul is evident.

(s. v. Bezek), about seven hours to the north of Nabulus towards Beisan (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-4.htm">Judges 1:4</a>). The number assembled were 300,000 men of Israel, and 30,000 of Judah. These numbers will not appear too large, if we bear in mind that the allusion is not to a regular army, but that Saul had summoned all the people to a general levy. In the distinction drawn between the children of Judah and the children of Israel we may already discern a trace of that separation of Judah from the rest of the tribes, which eventually led to a formal secession on the part of the latter.</body></html>
