It was Samuel to whom the people looked to bring to punishment the men who had dared to question the wisdom of electing Saul as king. It should be remembered, too, that the royal summons to Israel which accompanied the bloody war-signal of King Saul, ran in the joint names of Saul and Samuel. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-7.htm" title="And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.">1Samuel 11:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/11-12.htm" title="And the people said to Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death....">1 Samuel 11:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">The people said unto Samuel — </span>Who, it appears from hence, accompanied Saul in this expedition, to encourage him with hopes of good success. <span class="ital">Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day</span> — Saul had prudently dissembled his knowledge of their despising him before the kingdom was confirmed to him. But the moderation which he now manifested, after he had been so wonderfully victorious, argued still greater nobleness of mind, and benevolence, and mildness of disposition. For nothing is more glorious than to be humble and meek in the height of power.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:12-15 They now honoured Saul whom they had despised; and if an enemy be made a friend, that is more to our advantage than to have him slain. The once despised Saviour will at length be acknowledged by all as the Lord's own anointed king. As yet, upon his mercy-seat, he receives the submission of rebels, and even pleads their cause; but shortly, from his righteous tribunal, he will condemn all who persist in opposing him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The march from Bezek may have begun the night before. This disposition of the forces "in three companies" (imitating Gideon's strategy, compare the marginal reference.) would not have been made until the morning when they were very near the Ammonitish forces. "The morning watch" was the last of the three watches, of four hours each, into which the night was anciently divided by the Hebrews. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19</a> note.)

The calm and sagacious counsel of Samuel directed the popular feelings into a right channel, by appointing a general assembly of the militia, the really effective force of the nation, at Gilgal, where, amid great pomp and religious solemnities, the victorious leader was confirmed in his kingdom [1Sa 11:15].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall Saul reign over us?</span> they did not say so in terms, a we may see, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-27.htm" title="But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?

By which it seems that Samuel accompanied Saul in this expedition; though it is somewhat difficult to account for it, that a man of his years should be able to attend so quick a march that Saul made; it may be, therefore, that he might follow after him gently, and meet him quickly after the battle was fought, when the people made the following speech to him: <p>who is he that said, shall Saul reign over us? is such a mean inexperienced man fit to rule over us? who can bear his government, and submit to it? what can be expected from him, that he should deliver and save us out of the hands of our enemies? in this they had respect to the sons of Belial, and what they said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>, but now it appeared he was sufficiently qualified, and God had made him an instrument of salvation, and was a proper person to be king over them: <p>bring the men, that we may put them to death; so transported were they with affection to Saul, and indignation against those men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the people said unto Samuel, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> Who <i>is</i> he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.</span><p>(g) By this victory the Lord won the hearts of the people to Saul.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people said unto Samuel.</span> Even after this glorious victory the people turn to Samuel, and doubtless his presence and influence had had great weight in gaining obedience to Saul's command (ver. 7). They now, with the old tumultuous violence, demand' that those who had opposed Saul's election should be put to death. Probably the ringleaders of Saul's opponents were some of the ciders disappointed at not being chosen themselves (see on 1 Samuel 10:27). But Saul displays, first, the kingly virtue of clemency, saying, <span class="cmt_word">There shall not a man be put to death this day</span> - a decision politic as well as generous, for bloodshed would have led only to future feuds; and, secondly, piety, in so humbly ascribing to Jehovah the salvation that had been wrought in Israel.
