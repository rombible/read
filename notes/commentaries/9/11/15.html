Version that Saul was anointed afresh at Gilgal. The Greek Version reads, “and Samuel anointed Saul king there.” The Gilgal convention was nothing more than a solemn national confirmation of the popular election at Mizpeh. The words “before the Lord,” imply the presence of the Ark, or of the high priest with the mystic Urim and Thummim. Bishop Wordsworth understands the words “they made Saul king” to signify that after this “the people would not allow him any longer to lead a private life, but they made him to assume the royal state and authority to which he had been appointed by God.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm" title="And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.">1 Samuel 11:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">There they made Saul king — </span>Owned and accepted him for their king. Saul had been anointed in Ramah, and chosen by lot in Mizpeh; but still some disdained to acknowledge him for their king, which made him content himself for a time with a private life. But now, after this signal token of God’s presence with him, in the late victory, he was, by common consent, received by all the people for their king. <span class="ital">Before the Lord — </span>Not before the ark, the symbol of God’s presence, as the expression sometimes means; for the ark was now at Kirjath-jearim, and not at Gilgal; but in a solemn manner, as in God’s presence, appealing to him as a witness of their sincerity in this transaction, and with solemn sacrifices and prayers for his blessing upon it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:12-15 They now honoured Saul whom they had despised; and if an enemy be made a friend, that is more to our advantage than to have him slain.

The example of David, who, besides his original anointing by Samuel <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>, was twice anointed, first as king of Judah <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>, and again as king over all Israel <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>, makes it probable that Saul was anointed a second time; but this may be included in the word "made king" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-5.htm">1 Samuel 12:5</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 11:12-15.

The calm and sagacious counsel of Samuel directed the popular feelings into a right channel, by appointing a general assembly of the militia, the really effective force of the nation, at Gilgal, where, amid great pomp and religious solemnities, the victorious leader was confirmed in his kingdom [1Sa 11:15].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They made Saul king, </span> i.e. they recognized him, or owned and accepted him for their king by consent; for, to speak properly, Saul was not made or constituted king by the people, but by the Lord’s immediate act: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-9.htm" title="Now therefore listen to their voice: however, yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.">1 Samuel 8:9</a> 10:1</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before the Lord; </span> who was there present in a special manner; both because the people of the Lord were there assembled, and because there was an altar, as the following sacrifices show.

Agreed to the motion, and marched along with Saul and Samuel thither: <p>and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal; that is, they declared him to be king there; he was inaugurated into, and invested with his office, otherwise it was God only that made him king, who only had the power of making one, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>. Josephus says (e) that Samuel anointed him with the holy oil; and so the Septuagint version here renders it,"and Samuel anointed Saul there to be king;''and it is not improbable, that as he privately anointed him, he did it publicly also; if not at the election of him, then at this time; and it is observable, that in the next chapter, and not before, he is called the Lord's anointed. Now this was "before the Lord"; in this place; this being, as Abarbinel observes, a sanctified place, where the tabernacle and ark of God had been; and he supposes it probable that the ark was brought hither; but it was enough that the people and congregation of the Lord were here, and who, when assembled in his name, his presence was with them: <p>and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord; where an altar was built, and on which they offered these peace offerings by way of thanksgiving, partly for the victory obtained over the Ammonites, and partly for the renewal of the kingdom to Saul, and their unanimity in it, as well as to implore and obtain future peace and prosperity: <p>and there Saul, and all the people of Israel, rejoiced greatly; they in their king, and he in the good will of his people, and both in the great salvation God had wrought for them. <p>(e) Ut supra, (Antiqu. l. 6. c. 5.) sect. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</span><p>(i) In sign of thanksgiving for the victory.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">there they made Saul king</span>] The choice of Saul as king, privately made by God through Samuel, and publicly confirmed by the election at Mizpah, had received an unmistakable ratification in his victory over Nahash. His detractors were silenced, and the unanimous consent of the people accepted him. The assembly now held after the general levy for the war was probably larger and more representative of the whole nation than the previous one at Mizpah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Sept. has, “and Samuel anointed Saul there to be king,” which may possibly be the original reading.
