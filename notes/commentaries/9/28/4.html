Shunem is known in Biblical history as the home of Abishag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-3.htm" title="So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.">1Kings 1:3</a>), and the dwelling-place of the woman who entertained Elisha, and whose dead son he raised to life (2 Kings 4).<p>It has been identified by modern travellers. Conder speaks of it as being at present only a mud hamlet, with cactus hedges and a spring; but the view, he says, extends as far as Mount Carmel, fifteen miles away. It is now called Sutêm.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.</span>—Saul’s position was only a few miles distant from the camp of his enemies, on the slope of the hills opposite Shunem, but parted by the deep Valley of Jezreel. From the high ground by his camp Saul could plainly see the whole of the Philistine army. Mount Gilboa is the name given to a range of lofty hills, rising 1,500 feet above the sea, and consisting of white chalk.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-6 David could not refuse Achish without danger. If he promised assistance, and then stood neuter, or went over to the Israelites, he would behave with ingratitude and treachery. If he fought against Israel, he would sin greatly. It seemed impossible that he should get out of this difficulty with a clear conscience; but his evasive answer, intended to gain time, was not consistent with the character of an Israelite indeed. Troubles are terrors to the children of disobedience. In his distress, Saul inquired of the Lord. He did not seek in faith, but with a double, unstable mind. Saul had put the law in force against those that had familiar spirits, Ex 22:18. Many seem zealous against, sin, when they are any way hurt by it, who have no concern for the glory of God, nor any dislike of sin as sin. Many seem enemies to sin in others, while they indulge it in themselves. Saul will drive the devil out of his kingdom, yet harbours him in his heart by envy and malice. How foolish to consult those whom, according to God's law, he had endeavoured to root out!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gilboa - Now called Jebel Fukuak. But the ancient name is preserved in the village of Jelbon, situated on the south side of the mountain. It was separated from Shunem (see the marginal reference) by the deep valley of Jezreel. The Philistines either advanced along the seacoast, and then entered the valley of Jezreel from the west, or they came by the present road right through Samaria, starting from Aphek <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. the Philistines &#8230; pitched in Shunem&#8212;Having collected their forces for a last grand effort, they marched up from the seacoast and encamped in the "valley of Jezreel." The spot on which their encampment was fixed was Shunem (Jos 19:18), now Sulem, a village which still exists on the slope of a range called "Little Hermon." On the opposite side, on the rise of Mount Gilboa, hard by "the spring of Jezreel," was Saul's army&#8212;the Israelites, according to their wont, keeping to the heights, while their enemies clung to the plain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shunem; </span> a town in the tribe of Issachar, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm" title="And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,">Joshua 19:18</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gilboa; </span> a mountain not far from the valley of Jezreel, where the battle was fought, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.">1 Samuel 31:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-21.htm" title="You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, on you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.">2 Samuel 1:21</a></span>.

This was a village in the tribe of Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>), rendered famous as the abode of the woman who made a little chamber for Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>); and from thence also came Abishag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>). Conder describes it as being at present only a mud hamlet, with cactus hedges and a spring, but the view extends, he says, as far as to Mount Carmel, fifteen miles away ('Tent-Work,' 1:123). It is now called Sulem, a name given to it also by Eusebius, and lies upon the slopes of the little Hermon, opposite Mount Gilboa, from which it is separated by the valley of Jezreel. This broad plain "is bounded on the east by the range of Gilboa, rising 1500 feet above the sea, and consisting of white chalk; while on the west a long spur runs out at about the same average elevation with Gilboa, and wends northwest to the ridge of Carmel (Conder, 'Handbook,' p. 209). As the valley is about 250 feet above the sea level, Saul, from an elevation of 1200 feet, would easily see the camp of the Philistines pitched upon the slopes of the opposite range at a distance of about four miles. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Achish said, "Ye have not made an invasion to-day, have ye?" &#1488;&#1500;, like &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;, is an interrogative sense; the &#1492; has dropped out: vid., Ewald, 324, b. David replied, "Against the south of Judah, and the south of the Jerahmeelites, and into the south of the Kenites," sc., we have made an incursion. This reply shows that the Geshurites, Gerzites, and Amalekites dwelt close to the southern boundary of Judah, so that David was able to represent the march against these tribes to Achish as a march against the south of Judah, to make him believe that he had been making an attack upon the southern territory of Judah and its dependencies. The Negeb of Judah is the land between the mountains of Judah and the desert of Arabia (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>). The Jerahmeelites are the descendants of Jerahmeel, the first-born of Hezron (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-25.htm">1 Chronicles 2:25-26</a>), and therefore one of the three large families of Judah who sprang from Hezron. They probably dwelt on the southern frontier of the tribe of Judah (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>). The Kenites were protgs of Judah (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-11.htm">1 Samuel 27:11</a> the writer introduces the remark, that in his raid David left neither man nor woman of his enemies alive, to take them to Gath, because he thought "they might report against us, and say, Thus hath David done." There ought to be a major point under &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, as the following clause does not contain the words of the slaughtered enemies, but is a clause appended by the historian himself, to the effect that David continued to act in that manner as long as he dwelt in the land of the Philistines. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, the mode of procedure; lit. the right which he exercised (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-9.htm">1 Samuel 8:9</a>). </body></html>
