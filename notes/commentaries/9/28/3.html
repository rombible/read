In other words, the compiler says: “Now Samuel, whom Saul was so anxious to see, was dead and buried, and the possessors of familiar spirits, whose aid Saul was about to invoke to carry out his purpose, had long since been put out, by his own order, from the land.” “Those that had familiar spirits”—those that had at their command <span class= "ital">ôboth, </span>rendered “familiar spirits,” the plural form of <span class= "ital">ôb, </span>a word which has never been explained with any certainty. Scholars think they can connect it with <span class= "ital">ôb, to be hollow, </span>and <span class= "ital">ôb </span>is then “the hollow thing,” or “bag;” and so it came to signify, “one who speaks in a hollow voice.” It hence appears to mean the distended belly of the <span class= "ital">ventriloquist, </span>a word by which the LXX. always render <span class= "ital">ôb. </span>It thus is used to designate the male or female ventriloquist, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-3.htm" title="And David dwelled with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.">1Samuel 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-9.htm" title="And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.">1Samuel 27:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-11.htm" title="Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>, &c., and also the spirit which was supposed to speak from the belly of the ventriloquist; in this sense it is so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/27-8.htm" title="And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 27:8-9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a>.

Saul, in his early zeal, we read, had actively put in force these edicts of Moses, which apparently, in the lax state of things which had long prevailed in Israel, had been suffered to lie in abeyance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm" title="Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.

If he promised assistance, and then stood neuter, or went over to the Israelites, he would behave with ingratitude and treachery. If he fought against Israel, he would sin greatly. It seemed impossible that he should get out of this difficulty with a clear conscience; but his evasive answer, intended to gain time, was not consistent with the character of an Israelite indeed. Troubles are terrors to the children of disobedience. In his distress, Saul inquired of the Lord. He did not seek in faith, but with a double, unstable mind. Saul had put the law in force against those that had familiar spirits, Ex 22:18. Many seem zealous against, sin, when they are any way hurt by it, who have no concern for the glory of God, nor any dislike of sin as sin. Many seem enemies to sin in others, while they indulge it in themselves. Saul will drive the devil out of his kingdom, yet harbours him in his heart by envy and malice.

Now Samuel is dead, &c.&#8212;This event is here alluded to as affording an explanation of the secret and improper methods by which Saul sought information and direction in the present crisis of his affairs. Overwhelmed in perplexity and fear, he yet found the common and legitimate channels of communication with Heaven shut against him. And so, under the impulse of that dark, distempered, superstitious spirit which had overmastered him, he resolved, in desperation, to seek the aid of one of those fortune telling impostors whom, in accordance with the divine command (Le 19:31; 20:6, 27; De 18:11), he had set himself formerly to exterminate from his kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Samuel was dead:</span> this is mentioned here as the reason why Saul did not inquire of Samuel; which, if he had now been alive, he would have done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In his own city, </span> where he had his birth and education, and most settled habitation, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-18.htm" title="So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him.

This he did, either by Samuel’s instigation; or from a conceit that the evil spirit came upon him by some of their means; or that he might gain the repute of a religious prince, which was very useful to him; or that he might quiet his troubled conscience, and please God as far as his interest would give him leave. And this is here related, partly to show that a hypocrite and wicked man may obey some of God’s commands, and principally to bring in the following history. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of the land</span> of Israel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now Samuel was dead,....

And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.">1 Samuel 25:1</a>); (2) Saul’s expulsion of the soothsayers. This he probably did in the early part of his reign.

The occasion of this attack is not mentioned, as being a matter of indifference in relation to the chief object of the history; but it is no doubt to be sought for in plundering incursions made by these tribes into the land of Israel. For David would hardly have entered upon such a war in the situation in which he was placed at that time without some such occasion, seeing that it would be almost sure to bring him into suspicion with Achish, and endanger his safety. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, "he advanced," the verb being used, as it frequently is, to denote the advance of an army against a people or town (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>). At the same time, the tribes which he attacked may have had their seat upon the mountain plateau in the northern portion of the desert of Paran, so that David was obliged to march up to reach them. &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, to invade for the purpose of devastation and plunder. Geshuri is a tribe mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2</a> as living in the south of the territory of the Philistines, and is a different tribe from the Geshurites in the north-east of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>). These are the only passages in which they are mentioned. The Gerzites, or Gizrites according to the Keri, are entirely unknown. Bonfrere and Clericus suppose them to be the Gerreni spoken of in 2 Macc. 13:24, who inhabited the town of Gerra, between Rhinocolura and Pelusium (Strabo, xvi. 760), or Gerron (Ptol. iv. 5). This conjecture is a possible one, but is very uncertain nevertheless, as the Gerzites certainly dwelt somewhere in the desert of Arabia. At any rate Grotius and Ewald cannot be correct in their opinion that they were the inhabitants of Gezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>). The Amalekites were the remnant of this old hereditary foe of the Israelites, who had taken to flight on Saul's war of extermination, and had now assembled again (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8-9</a>). "For they inhabit the land, where you go from of old to Shur, even to the land of Egypt." The &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; may be explained from the fact that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;&#1498; is not adverbial here, but is construed according to its form as an infinitive: literally, "where from of old thy coming is to Shur." &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; cannot have crept into the text through a copyist's mistake, as such a mistake would not have found its way into all the MSS. The fact that the early translators did not render the word proves nothing against its genuineness, but merely shows that the translators regarded it as superfluous. Moreover, the Alexandrian text is decidedly faulty here, and &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is confounded with &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;. Shur is the desert of Jifar, which is situated in front of Egypt (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>). These tribes were nomads, and had large flocks, which David took with him as booty when he had smitten the tribes themselves. After his return, David betook himself to Achish, to report to the Philistian king concerning his enterprise, and deceive him as to its true character. </body></html>
