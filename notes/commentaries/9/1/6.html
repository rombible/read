The one sin of polygamy poisons the whole home life of the family, in all other respects apparently a quiet, Godfearing, orderly household.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Elkanah kept up his attendance at God's altar, notwithstanding the unhappy differences in his family. If the devotions of a family prevail not to put an end to its divisions, yet let not the divisions put a stop to the devotions. To abate our just love to any relation for the sake of any infirmity which they cannot help, and which is their affliction, is to make God's providence quarrel with his precept, and very unkindly to add affliction to the afflicted. It is evidence of a base disposition, to delight in grieving those who are of a sorrowful spirit, and in putting those out of humour who are apt to fret and be uneasy. We ought to bear one another's burdens, not add to them. Hannah could not bear the provocation. Those who are of a fretful spirit, and are apt to lay provocations too much to heart, are enemies to themselves, and strip themselves of many comforts both of life and godliness. We ought to notice comforts, to keep us from grieving for crosses. We should look at that which is for us, as well as what is against us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A worthy portion - Probably as in the margin.

That is, Peninnah, the other wife of Elkanah; for when a man had more wives, two or more, they were usually at enmity to one another, as the two wives of Socrates were, being always jealous lest one should have more love and respect than the other from the husband; and this woman provoked Hannah one time after another, and continually, by upbraiding her with her barrenness; and this was another reason why Elkanah did all he could to comfort her, not only because the Lord had restrained her from bearing children, but because also she that envied and emulated her sadly provoked her: <p>for to make her fret; and be uneasy, and murmur at and complain of her unhappy circumstances: some render it, "because she thundered" (l) against her; that is, Peninnah was exceeding loud and clamorous with her reproaches and scoffs, which were grievously provoking to Hannah. So said Socrates, when Xantippe first scolded at him, and then poured foul water on him: did not I say, says he, that Xantippe first thunders, and then rains (m)? <p>because the Lord had shut up her womb; it was this Peninnah upbraided her with, and at which Hannah fretted and grieved. <p>(l)  "propterea quod intonabat contra eam", Piscator.

Peninnah, triumphant in her fruitfulness, is yet Hannah's adversary, because, in spite of her barrenness, she has the larger portion of the husband's love; while Hannah is so sorely vexed at the taunts of her rival, that she weeps from sheer vexation. In vain Elkanah tries to give her comfort. The husband really is not "better than ten sons," for the joy of motherhood is quite distinct from that of conjugal affection, and especially to a Hebrew woman, who had special hopes from which she was cut off by barrenness. In ver. 7 there is a strange confusion of subject, owing to the first verb having been read as an active instead of a passive. It should be, "And so it happened year by year: when she (Hannah) went up to the house of Jehovah she (Peninnah) thus provoked her, and she wept and did not eat." It must be remembered that the Hebrews had no written vowels, but only consonants; the vowels were added in Christian times, many centuries after the coming of our Lord, and represent the traditional manner of reading of one great Jewish school. They are to be treated with the greatest respect, because as a rule they give us a sense confirmed by the best authorities; but they are human, and form no part of Holy Scripture. The ancient versions, the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, which are all three older than the Masoretic vowels, translate, "And so she (Peninnah) did year by year;" but this requires a slight change of the consonants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"These are the generations of Perez," i.e., the families descended from Perez in their genealogical order (toledoth: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>). The genealogy only goes back as far as Perez, because he was the founder of the family of Judah which was named after him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-20.htm">Numbers 26:20</a>), and to which Elimelech and Boaz belonged. Perez, a son of Judah by Tamar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29</a>), begat Hezrom, who is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a> among the sons of Judah who emigrated with Jacob into Egypt, although (as we have shown in our comm. on the passage) he was really born in Egypt. Of this son Ram (called Aram in the Sept. Cod. Al., and from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>) nothing further is known, as he is only mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>. His son Amminidab was the father-in-law of Aaron, who had married his daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>), and the father of Nahesson (Nahshon), the tribe-prince of the house of Judah in the time of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>). According to this there are only four or five generations to the 430 years spent by the Israelites in Egypt, if we include both Perez and Nahesson; evidently not enough for so long a time, so that some of the intermediate links must have been left out even here. But the omission of unimportant members becomes still more apparent in the statement which follows, viz., that Nahshon begat Salmah, and Salmah Boaz, in which only two generations are given for a space of more than 250 years, which intervened between the death of Moses and the time of Gideon. Salmah (&#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; or &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-11.htm">1 Chronicles 2:11</a>) is called Salmon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-21.htm">Ruth 4:21</a>; a double form of the name, which is to be explained form the fact that Salmah grew out of Salmon through the elision of the n, and that the terminations an and on are used promiscuously, as we may see from the form &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-18.htm">Job 41:18</a> when compared with &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-38.htm">1 Samuel 17:38</a> (see Ewald, 163-4). According to the genealogy of Christ in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>, Salmon married Rahab; consequently he was a son, or at any rate a grandson, of Nahshon, and therefore all the members between Salmon and Boaz have been passed over. Again, the generations from Boaz to David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-21.htm">Ruth 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-22.htm">Ruth 4:22</a>) may possibly be complete, although in all probability one generation has been passed over even here between Obed and Jesse. It is also worthy of notice that the whole chain from Perez to David consists of ten links, five of which (from Perez to Nahshon) belong to the 430 years of the sojourn in Egypt, and five (from Salmon to David) to the 476 years between the exodus from Egypt and the death of David. This symmetrical division is apparently as intentional as the limitation of the whole genealogy to ten members, for the purpose of stamping upon it through the number ten as the seal of completeness the character of a perfect, concluded, and symmetrical whole.<p>The genealogy closes with David, an evident proof that the book was intended to give a family picture form the life of the pious ancestors of this great and godly king of Israel. But for us the history which points to David acquires a still higher signification, from the fact that all the members of the genealogy of David whose names occur here are also found in the genealogy of Jesus Christ. "The passage is given by Matthew word for word in the genealogy of Christ, that we may see that this history looks not so much to David as to Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed by all as the Saviour and Redeemer of the human race, and that we may learn with what wonderful compassion the Lord raises up the lowly and despised to the greatest glory and majesty" (Brentius).</body></html>
