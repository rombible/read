This is a striking picture of one of the many holy homes in Israel, even in the wild, disorderly days of the Judges, and of the deep degradation of the priests of the sanctuary.<p>“The house at Ramah,” the usual short name by which the city, “The Ramahs of the Watchers,” <span class= "ital">Ramathaim-zophim, </span>was known.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/1-19.htm" title="And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her....">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord remembered her — </span>Manifested his remembrance of her by the effect. <span class="ital">She called his name Samuel — </span>That is, <span class="ital">asked of God.

Prayer and provender do not hinder a journey. When men are in such haste to set out upon journeys, or to engage in business, that they have not time to worship God, they are likely to proceed without his presence and blessing. Hannah, though she felt a warm regard for the courts of God's house, begged to stay at home. God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Those who are detained from public ordinances, by the nursing and tending of little children, may take comfort from this instance, and believe, that if they do that duty in a right spirit, God will graciously accept them therein. Hannah presented her child to the Lord with a grateful acknowledgment of his goodness in answer to prayer. Whatever we give to God, it is what we have first asked and received from him. All our gifts to him were first his gifts to us. The child Samuel early showed true piety. Little children should be taught to worship God when very young. Their parents should teach them in it, bring them to it, and put them on doing it as well as they can; God will graciously accept them, and will teach them to do better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A beautiful example of the composing influence of prayer. Hannah had cast her burden upon the Lord, and so her own spirit was relieved of its load.

Eli marked her mouth&#8212;The suspicion of the aged priest seems to indicate that the vice of intemperance was neither uncommon nor confined to one sex in those times of disorder. This mistaken impression was immediately removed, and, in the words, "God grant," or rather, "will grant," was followed by an invocation which, as Hannah regarded it in the light of a prophecy pointing to the accomplishment of her earnest desire, dispelled her sadness, and filled her with confident hope [1Sa 1:18]. The character and services of the expected child were sufficiently important to make his birth a fit subject for prophecy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They rose up in the morning early; </span> partly for their journey, and partly for prayer, as it follows, for which this was a very fit and usual time, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-3.htm" title="My voice shall you hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer to you, and will look up.">Psalm 5:3</a> 119:147</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Remembered her, </span> i.e. manifested his remembrance of her by the effect. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they rose up in the morning early,.... Partly for devotion, and partly for the sake of their journey: <p>and worshipped before the Lord; went up to the tabernacle, and prayed with their faces towards that part of it, the western part, where stood the ark of the Lord, the symbol of the divine Presence; and when they no doubt gave thanks for all the favours they had received there, and prayed for a safe and prosperous journey home, committing themselves to the care of divine Providence: <p>and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; or "Ramatha", the same with Ramathaim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>.

It seems to have been the mother's right to give names to her children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-60.htm">Luke 1:60</a>), and Hannah saw in Samuel, whom she had asked of God, a living proof that she had been heard by him. The name, therefore, is of fuller significance than the reason given for it. Ishmael has virtually the same meaning, signifying "God heareth."
