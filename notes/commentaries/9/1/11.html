The mother looked on to a life-long service in the ritual of the Tabernacle for him, but the Being who heard her prayer destined her son for higher work; in his case the priestly duties were soon merged in the far more responsible ones of the prophet—the great reformer of the people. The second promise undertook that he should be a Nazarite. Now the Nazariteship included three things—the refraining from intoxicating drinks, the letting the hair grow, and the avoiding all ceremonial defilement by corpses even of the nearest kin. Samuel was what the Talmud calls a perpetual Nazarite.<p>These strange restrictions and customs had an inner signification. The abstinence from wine and strong drink typified that the Nazarite determined to avoid all sensual indulgence which might cloud the mind and render the man unfit for prayer to, and work for, the Lord; the avoiding contact with the dead was a perpetual outward protest that the vower of the solemn vow renounced all moral defilement, that he gave up every thing which could stain and soil the life consecrated to the Eternal’s service; the untouched hair, which here is especially mentioned, was a public protest that the consecrated one had determined to refrain from intercourse with the world, and to devote the whole strength and fulness of life to the Lord’s work. The LXX. (Greek) Version here inserts the words, “and he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink,” wishing to bring the passage into stricter accordance with Numbers 6. The original Hebrew text, however, contents itself with specifying merely the outward sign of the untouched hair, by which these solemnly consecrated ones were publicly known.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1 Samuel 1:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">But wilt give unto thy handmaid — </span>She thrice calls herself God’s handmaid, out of a profound sense of her meanness, and his majesty.

God gives us leave, in prayer, not only to ask good things in general, but to mention that special good thing we most need and desire. She spoke softly, none could hear her. Hereby she testified her belief of God's knowledge of the heart and its desires. Eli was high priest, and judge in Israel. It ill becomes us to be rash and hasty in censures of others, and to think people guilty of bad things while the matter is doubtful and unproved. Hannah did not retort the charge, and upbraid Eli with the wicked conduct of his own sons. When we are at any time unjustly censured, we have need to set a double watch before the door of our lips, that we do not return censure for censure. Hannah thought it enough to clear herself, and so must we. Eli was willing to acknowledge his mistake. Hannah went away with satisfaction of mind. She had herself by prayer committed her case to God, and Eli had prayed for her. Prayer is heart's ease to a gracious soul. Prayer will smooth the countenance; it should do so. None will long remain miserable, who use aright the privilege of going to the mercy-seat of a reconciled God in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>vows are characteristic of this particular age of the Judges.

This was the burden of Hannah's prayer; and the strong preference she expressed for a male child originated in her purpose of dedicating him to the tabernacle service.

See Numbers 6. The vow was usually taken for a limited time only, but Samson, Samuel, and St John the Baptist were dedicated to a perpetual Nazirate from their birth.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And it came to pass, the day, and he offered sacrifice" (for, "on which he offered sacrifice"), that he gave to Peninnah and her children portions of the flesh of the sacrifice at the sacrificial meal; but to Hannah he gave &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1502;&#1490;&#1492;, "one portion for two persons," i.e., a double portion, because he loved her, but Jehovah had shut up her womb: i.e., he gave it as an expression of his love to her, to indicate by a sign, "thou art as dear to me as if thou hadst born me a child" (O. v. Gerlach). This explanation of the difficult word &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, of which very different interpretations have been given, is the one adopted by Tanchum Hieros., and is the only one which can be grammatically sustained, or yields an appropriate sense. The meaning face (facies) is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a> and other passages; and the use of &#1500;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; as a synonym for &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-23.htm">1 Samuel 25:23</a>, also establishes the meaning "person," since &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is used in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-11.htm">2 Samuel 17:11</a>. It is true that there are no other passages that can be adduced to prove that the singular &#1488;&#1507; was also used in this sense; but as the word was employed promiscuously in both singular and plural in the derivative sense of anger, there is no reason for denying that the singular may also have been employed in the sense of face (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;). The combination of &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1502;&#1490;&#1492; in the absolute state is supported by many other examples of the same kind (see Ewald, 287, h). The meaning double has been correctly adopted in the Syriac, whereas Luther follows the tristis of the Vulgate, and renders the word traurig, or sad. But this meaning, which Fr. Bttcher has lately taken under his protection, cannot be philologically sustained either by the expression &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-6.htm">Genesis 4:6</a>), or by <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-20.htm">Daniel 11:20</a>, or in any other way. &#1488;&#1507; and &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; do indeed signify anger, but anger and sadness are two very different ideas. But when Bttcher substitutes "angrily or unwillingly" for sadly, the incongruity strikes you at once: "he gave her a portion unwillingly, because he loved her!" For the custom of singling out a person by giving double or even large portions, see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-34.htm">Genesis 43:34</a>.</body></html>
