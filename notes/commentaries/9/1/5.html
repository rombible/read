It was an expression of his deep love for her. As Von Gerlach puts it, “Thou art as dear to me as if thou hadst borne me a child.” Some scholars would translate the difficult Hebrew expression here by, “But to Hannah he gave a portion of anger or sadness,” thus intensifying the natural sorrow of Hannah by representing her husband as unkind. The Vulgate, Luther, and Abarbanel favour this singular interpretation; but the one adopted by the English Version, and explained above, is in all respects grammatically and exegetically to be preferred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/1-5.htm" title="But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb....">1 Samuel 1:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion — </span>Or, a double portion; in token of his extraordinary respect and kindness to her. <span class="ital">For he loved Hannah: but the Lord — </span>Or, <span class="ital">though the Lord, had shut her womb — </span>Her barrenness did not cause him to love her less, but rather more; because he would comfort her under her affliction.

If the devotions of a family prevail not to put an end to its divisions, yet let not the divisions put a stop to the devotions. To abate our just love to any relation for the sake of any infirmity which they cannot help, and which is their affliction, is to make God's providence quarrel with his precept, and very unkindly to add affliction to the afflicted. It is evidence of a base disposition, to delight in grieving those who are of a sorrowful spirit, and in putting those out of humour who are apt to fret and be uneasy. We ought to bear one another's burdens, not add to them. Hannah could not bear the provocation. Those who are of a fretful spirit, and are apt to lay provocations too much to heart, are enemies to themselves, and strip themselves of many comforts both of life and godliness. We ought to notice comforts, to keep us from grieving for crosses. We should look at that which is for us, as well as what is against us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A worthy portion - Probably as in the margin.

Elkanah marked his love for Hannah by giving her a double portion. Similarly Joseph distinguished Benjamin by sending him a fivefold portion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-34.htm" title="And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.">Genesis 43:34</a>). But the Sept. points to a different reading which would give the following sense: “And to Hannah he gave a single portion, because she had no child: nevertheless Elkanah loved Hannah most: but the Lord had shut up her womb.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">had shut up her womb</span>] Hannah’s faith might have been strengthened by the recollection that Sarah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-1.htm" title="Now Sarai Abram's wife bore him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.">Genesis 16:1</a>), Rachel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-1.htm" title="And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.">Genesis 30:1</a>), Manoah’s wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm" title="And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.">Jdg 13:2</a>), all had to bear the reproach of childlessness for a time, and all eventually bore illustrious sons.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A worthy portion.</span> This rendering is based upon the idea that the Hebrew, which is literally "one portion of two faces," may mean "one portion enough for two persons." But for this there is no sufficient authority, and though the word is a dual, it really signifies the two sides of the face, or more exactly "the two nostrils," and so simply the countenance. The Syriac translation, "a double portion," is based upon an accidental resemblance between the words. As the term sometimes signifies anger from the swelling of the nostrils of an enraged person, the Vulgate translates, "And Elkanah was sad when he gave Hannah her portion; for..." The Septuagint has a different reading, <span class="accented">epes</span> for <span class="accented">apaim</span>, and though the words look different in our writing, they are nearly identical in Hebrew. This is probably the true reading, and the translation would then be, <span class="accented">"And to Hannah he gave one portion only</span> (because she bad no child, while Peninnah had many portions, as each son and daughter had a share); <span class="accented">for he loved Hannah</span> (and did not leave her without this mark of affection), <span class="accented">though Jehovah had shut up her womb."</span> These portions were of course taken from those parts of the victim which formed a feast for the offerers, after Jehovah and the priests had had their dues. It is plain from this feast that Elkanah's annual sacrifice was a peace offering, for the law of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-21</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"These are the generations of Perez," i.e., the families descended from Perez in their genealogical order (toledoth: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>). The genealogy only goes back as far as Perez, because he was the founder of the family of Judah which was named after him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-20.htm">Numbers 26:20</a>), and to which Elimelech and Boaz belonged. Perez, a son of Judah by Tamar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29</a>), begat Hezrom, who is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a> among the sons of Judah who emigrated with Jacob into Egypt, although (as we have shown in our comm. on the passage) he was really born in Egypt. Of this son Ram (called Aram in the Sept. Cod. Al., and from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>) nothing further is known, as he is only mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>. His son Amminidab was the father-in-law of Aaron, who had married his daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>), and the father of Nahesson (Nahshon), the tribe-prince of the house of Judah in the time of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>). According to this there are only four or five generations to the 430 years spent by the Israelites in Egypt, if we include both Perez and Nahesson; evidently not enough for so long a time, so that some of the intermediate links must have been left out even here. But the omission of unimportant members becomes still more apparent in the statement which follows, viz., that Nahshon begat Salmah, and Salmah Boaz, in which only two generations are given for a space of more than 250 years, which intervened between the death of Moses and the time of Gideon. Salmah (&#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; or &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-11.htm">1 Chronicles 2:11</a>) is called Salmon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-21.htm">Ruth 4:21</a>; a double form of the name, which is to be explained form the fact that Salmah grew out of Salmon through the elision of the n, and that the terminations an and on are used promiscuously, as we may see from the form &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-18.htm">Job 41:18</a> when compared with &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-38.htm">1 Samuel 17:38</a> (see Ewald, 163-4). According to the genealogy of Christ in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>, Salmon married Rahab; consequently he was a son, or at any rate a grandson, of Nahshon, and therefore all the members between Salmon and Boaz have been passed over. Again, the generations from Boaz to David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-21.htm">Ruth 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-22.htm">Ruth 4:22</a>) may possibly be complete, although in all probability one generation has been passed over even here between Obed and Jesse. It is also worthy of notice that the whole chain from Perez to David consists of ten links, five of which (from Perez to Nahshon) belong to the 430 years of the sojourn in Egypt, and five (from Salmon to David) to the 476 years between the exodus from Egypt and the death of David. This symmetrical division is apparently as intentional as the limitation of the whole genealogy to ten members, for the purpose of stamping upon it through the number ten as the seal of completeness the character of a perfect, concluded, and symmetrical whole.<p>The genealogy closes with David, an evident proof that the book was intended to give a family picture form the life of the pious ancestors of this great and godly king of Israel. But for us the history which points to David acquires a still higher signification, from the fact that all the members of the genealogy of David whose names occur here are also found in the genealogy of Jesus Christ. "The passage is given by Matthew word for word in the genealogy of Christ, that we may see that this history looks not so much to David as to Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed by all as the Saviour and Redeemer of the human race, and that we may learn with what wonderful compassion the Lord raises up the lowly and despised to the greatest glory and majesty" (Brentius).</body></html>
