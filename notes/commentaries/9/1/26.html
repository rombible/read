Prayer and provender do not hinder a journey. When men are in such haste to set out upon journeys, or to engage in business, that they have not time to worship God, they are likely to proceed without his presence and blessing. Hannah, though she felt a warm regard for the courts of God's house, begged to stay at home. God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Those who are detained from public ordinances, by the nursing and tending of little children, may take comfort from this instance, and believe, that if they do that duty in a right spirit, God will graciously accept them therein. Hannah presented her child to the Lord with a grateful acknowledgment of his goodness in answer to prayer. Whatever we give to God, it is what we have first asked and received from him. All our gifts to him were first his gifts to us. The child Samuel early showed true piety. Little children should be taught to worship God when very young. Their parents should teach them in it, bring them to it, and put them on doing it as well as they can; God will graciously accept them, and will teach them to do better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As thy soul liveth - This oath is unique to the Books of Samuel, in which it occurs six times, and to the Books of Kings, in which however, it is found only once.

According to the Targum, it is a supplication or request, I beseech thee, my lord; that is, to look upon her son, and take him under his care as his disciple or scholar, to instruct him in the law of God, and enter him into his service; to which Eli might be very backward and indifferent, and even treat it with some degree of contempt, that such a young Levite should be brought to him, when the soonest the Levites were admitted was at twenty five years of age: <p>as thy soul liveth, my lord; which Ben Gersom takes for the form of an oath, as if she swore to the truth of what follows by the life of the high priest; but as it was forbidden to swear by any but by the living God, by his life, it cannot be thought so good a woman as Hannah would be guilty of such a sinful and Heathenish practice; this rather is a wish or prayer for his life and health, and the continuance thereof, to bring up her son in the exercise of true religion: <p>I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord: by which it appears that Eli was now at the tabernacle, and in the same place he was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a> when she was some years ago praying near him, at the distance of four cubits, as the Jews say: she takes no notice of his mistaking her for a drunken woman, nor of his censure on her, and the reproof he gave her; but puts him in mind only of her praying to the Lord standing near to him, which made him take the more notice of her; standing is a prayer posture; the Jews say there is no standing but what is prayer, or prayer is meant by it; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she said, Oh my lord, <i>as</i> thy <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> soul liveth, my lord, I <i>am</i> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</span><p>(k) That is, most certainly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">as thy soul liveth</span>] An oath peculiar to the books of Samuel and Kings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that stood by thee</span>] Prayer was offered either (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">standing</span>, as by Hannah and Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-22.htm" title="And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.">Genesis 18:22</a>), cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

The next morning Elkanah returned home to Ramah (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>) with his two wives, having first of all worshipped before the Lord; after which he knew his wife Hannah, and Jehovah remembered her, i.e., heard her prayer. "In the revolution of the days," i.e., of the period of her conception and pregnancy, Hannah conceived and bare a son, whom she called Samuel; "for (she said) I have asked him of the Lord." The name &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; (&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, lxx) is not formed from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1500;, name of God (Ges.

Because Hannah had asked him of Jehovah, she gave him the name, "the God-heard," as a memorial of the hearing of her prayer. </body></html>
