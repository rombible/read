That popular lilt, the folk-song of the Israelitish maidens, which sang of the prowess of David, the son of Jesse, was no doubt current in frontier towns like Gath, and at once the fugitive was recognised. We hear of no attempt made upon his life, or even against his liberty. The feeling among his generous foes was rather pitiful admiration mingled with wonder at seeing the doer of such splendid achievements in poverty and in exile.<p><span class= "bld">David the king.</span>—Here, again, the title king is vaguely used. Neither the people of Gath nor his own countrymen—save, perhaps, a few chosen spirits—knew of the sacred anointing by Samuel at Bethlehem. The appellation simply means: Is not this the renowned warrior, the greatest man in Israel of whom the people sing? Saul, our sovereign, has been a valiant captain over us, and has slain his thousands; but this one is greater still, he has slain his ten thousands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-11.htm" title="And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?">1 Samuel 21:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">King of the land — </span>Of Canaan.

In this place his person must have been known, and to venture into that country, he their greatest enemy, and with the sword of Goliath in his hand, would seem to have been a perilous experiment; but, doubtless, the protection he received implies that he had been directed by the divine oracle. Achish was generous (1Sa 27:6).

Thus Achish, though really a <span class="accented">seren</span> (see on 1 Samuel 5:11), is called king of Gath; and they meant nothing more as regards David than that he was Israel's great man, though in accepting Goliath's challenge he had undertaken what in old time was regarded as the king's especial duty. <span class="cmt_word">Did they not sing one to another of him in dances?</span> The Hebrew method of singing was by choruses, who sang and danced in turns to the music of their tambours (see on 1 Samuel 18:7). David evidently had hoped not to be recognised, but to be admitted to serve as a soldier, or in some other capacity, without many questions being asked. As we find an Edomite in Saul's service, Cushites, Maachathites, and other foreigners in the employment of David, there was probably much of this desertion of one service for another, especially as kings in those days had absolute authority and their displeasure was death. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David quieted him concerning this scruple, and said, "Nay, but women have been kept from us since yesterday and the day before." The use of &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; may be explained from the fact, that in David's reply he paid more attention to the sense than to the form of the priest's scruple, and expressed himself as concisely as possible. The words, "if the young men have only kept themselves from women," simply meant, if only they are not unclean; and David replied, That is certainly not the case, but women have been kept from us; so that &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has the meaning but in this passage also, as it frequently has after a previous negative, which is implied in the thought here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-33.htm">2 Samuel 13:33</a>. "When I came out, the young men's things were holy (Levitically clean); and if it is an unholy way, it becomes even holy through the instrument." David does not say that the young men were clean when he came out (for the rendering given to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; in the Septuagint, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, is without any critical value, and is only a mistaken attempt to explain the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, which was unintelligible to the translator), but simply affirms that &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, i.e., according to Luther's rendering (der Knaben Zeug war heilig), the young men's things (clothes, etc.) were holy. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean merely vessels, arms, or tools, but also the dress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>), or rather the clothes as well as such things as were most necessary to meet the wants of life. By the coitus, or strictly speaking, by the emissio seminis in connection with the coitus, not only were the persons themselves defiled, but also every article of clothing or leather upon which any of the semen fell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-18.htm">Leviticus 15:18</a>); so that it was necessary for the purpose of purification that the things which a man had on should all be washed. David explains, with evident allusion to this provision, that the young men's things were holy, i.e., perfectly clean, for the purpose of assuring the priest that there was not the smallest Levitical uncleanness attaching to them. The clause which follows is to be taken as conditional, and as supposing a possible case: "and if it is an unholy way." &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, the way that David was going with his young men, i.e., his purpose of enterprise, by which, however, we are not to understand his request of holy bread from Ahimelech, but the performance of the king's commission of which he had spoken. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488;&#1507;, lit. besides (there is) also that,  equals  moreover there is also the fact, that it becomes holy through the instrument; i.e., as O. v. Gerlach has correctly explained it, "on the supposition of the important royal mission, upon which David pretended to be sent, through me as an ambassador of the anointed of the Lord," in which, at any rate, David's meaning really was, "the way was sanctified before God, when he, as His chosen servant, the preserver of the true kingdom of God in Israel, went to him in his extremity." That &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; in the sense of instrument is also applied to men, is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-25.htm">Jeremiah 50:25</a>.</body></html>
