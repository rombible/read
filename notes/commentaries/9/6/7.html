And there was another reason for choosing such kine as are here mentioned; that it might be more manifest that they were led by the God of Israel, if they went directly into his country. For untamed heifers are apt to run back, or to wander, and keep no certain and constant paths, as oxen accustomed to the yoke do; and therefore were very unlikely to keep the direct road to the land of Israel. And the taking their calves from them would excite natural affection in them, and cause them rather to return home to their calves than to go into a strange country.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-9 Seven months the Philistines were punished with the presence of the ark; so long it was a plague to them, because they would not send it home sooner. Sinners lengthen out their own miseries by refusing to part with their sins. The Israelites made no effort to recover the ark. Alas! where shall we find concern for religion prevail above all other matters? In times of public calamity we fear for ourselves, for our families, and for our country; but who cares for the ark of God? We are favoured with the gospel, but it is treated with neglect or contempt. We need not wonder if it should be taken from us; to many persons this, though the heavies of calamities, would occasion no grief. There are multitudes whom any profession would please as well as that of Christianity. But there are those who value the house, the word, and the ministry of God above their richest possessions, who dread the loss of these blessings more than death. How willing bad men are to shift off their convictions, and when they are in trouble, to believe it is a chance that happens; and that the rod has no voice which they should hear or heed!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A new cart ... kine on which there hath come no yoke - This was so ordered in reverence to the ark, and was a right and true feeling.

The transposition of the A.V. throws undue stress upon the verb <span class="accented">make</span>, whereas the Hebrew simply means that both the cart was to be new, and the heifers untrained and unbroken to the yoke. Both these were marks of reverence. Nothing was to be employed in God's service which had been previously used for baser purposes (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-2.htm">Mark 11:2</a>). No animal was deemed fit for sacrifice which had laboured in the field. The separation of the kine from their calves was for the purpose of demonstrating whether the plague after all was supernatural, and it is remarkable what great care the Philistine priests take against confounding the extraordinary with the Divine. If, however, the kine act in a manner contrary to nature, their last doubt will be removed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Ark of God Sent Back. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-1.htm">1 Samuel 6:1-3</a>. The ark of Jehovah was in the land (lit. the fields, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a>) of the Philistines for seven months, and had brought destruction to all the towns to which it had been taken. At length the Philistines resolved to send it back to the Israelites, and therefore called their priests and diviners (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-23.htm">Numbers 23:23</a>) to ask them, "What shall we do with regard to the ark of God; tell us, with what shall we send it to its place?" "Its place" is the land of Israel, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; does not mean "in what manner" (quomodo: Vulgate, Thenius), but with what, wherewith (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6</a>). There is no force in the objection brought by Thenius, that if the question had implied with what presents, the priests would not have answered, "Do not send it without a present;" for the priests did not confine themselves to this answer, in which they gave a general assent, but proceeded at once to define the present more minutely. They replied, "If they send away the ark of the God of Israel (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; is to be taken as the third person in an indefinite address, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-24.htm">1 Samuel 2:24</a>, and not to be construed with &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; supplied), do not send it away empty (i.e., without an expiatory offering), but return Him (i.e., the God of Israel) a trespass-offering." &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, lit. guilt, then the gift presented as compensation for a fault, the trespass-offering (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14-6:7</a>). The gifts appointed by the Philistines as an asham were to serve as a compensation and satisfaction to be rendered to the God of Israel for the robbery committed upon Him by the removal of the ark of the covenant, and were therefore called asham, although in their nature they were only expiatory offerings. For the same reason the verb &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to return or repay, is used to denote the presentation of these gifts, being the technical expression for the payment of compensation for a fault in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-7.htm">Numbers 5:7</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a> for compensation for anything belonging to another, that had been unjustly appropriated. "Are ye healed then, it will show you why His hand is not removed from you," sc., so long as ye keep back the ark. The words &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1494; are to be understood as conditional, even without &#1488;&#1501;, which the rules of the language allow (see Ewald, 357, b.); this is required by the context. For, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>, the Philistine priests still thought it a possible thing that any misfortune which had befallen the Philistines might be only an accidental circumstance. With this view, they could not look upon a cure as certain to result from the sending back of the ark, but only as possible; consequently they could only speak conditionally, and with this the words "we shall know" agree. </body></html>
