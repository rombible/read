God's providence takes notice even of brute creatures, and serves its own purposes by them. When the reapers saw the ark, they rejoiced; their joy for that was greater than the joy of harvest. The return of the ark, and the revival of holy ordinances, after days of restraint and trouble, are matters of great joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word "Levites" here probably means priests <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14</a>, sons of Levi, since Bethshemesh was one of the cities of the priests <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13-16</a>. The burnt offering of the kine was not in any sense the offering of the men of Bethshemesh, but rather of the Philistine lords to whom the cart and the kine belonged. But the Bethshemites themselves, in token of their gratitude for such a signal mercy, now offered both burnt offerings and sacrifices, probably peace offerings, and doubtless feasted together with great joy and gladness (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62-66</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-17</a>). There is nothing whatever in the text to indicate that these sacrifices were offered otherwise than in the appointed way by the priests. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. and they clave&#8212;that is, the Beth-shemites, in an irrepressible outburst of joy.<p>offered the kine&#8212;Though contrary to the requirements of the law (Le 1:3; 22:19), these animals might properly be offered, as consecrated by God Himself; and though not beside the tabernacle, there were many instances of sacrifices offered by prophets and holy men on extraordinary occasions in other places.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, when they had seen that prodigious return of the ark to its own country, and the entertainment it found there. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it,....

When the Philistines, in accordance with the advice given them by their priests, had placed the ark of the covenant and the expiatory gifts upon the cart to which the two cows were harnessed, "the cows went straight forward on the way to Bethshemesh; they went along a road going and lowing (i.e., lowing the whole time), and turned not to the right or to the left; and the princes of the Philistines went behind them to the territory of Bethshemesh." &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, lit., "they were straight in the way," i.e., they went straight along the road. The form &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; is the imperf. Kal, third pers. plur. fem., with the preformative &#1497; instead of &#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-38.htm">Genesis 30:38</a> (see Ges. 47, Anm. 3; Ewald, 191, b.). Bethshemesh, the present Ain-shems, was a priests' city on the border of Judah and Dan (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>). </body></html>
