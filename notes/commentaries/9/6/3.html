Their people had insulted Him; He had shown Himself powerful enough, however, to injure His captors, so the insults must cease, and He must be appeased with rich offerings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-3.htm" title="And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.">1 Samuel 6:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Send it not empty — </span>They answer directly to the question, first in general; that it must not be sent back without some offering. <span class="ital">In any wise return him a trespass-offering — </span>As an acknowledgment that they had offended the God of Israel by bringing his ark from its proper place; for which they begged his pardon by this offering. <span class="ital">Then ye shall be healed,</span> &c. — Le Clerc renders this sentence, <span class="ital">Then if ye shall be healed, it shall be known, or manifest unto you, why his hand is not removed from you. </span>And it is evident this is the meaning of the words.

Sinners lengthen out their own miseries by refusing to part with their sins. The Israelites made no effort to recover the ark. Alas! where shall we find concern for religion prevail above all other matters? In times of public calamity we fear for ourselves, for our families, and for our country; but who cares for the ark of God? We are favoured with the gospel, but it is treated with neglect or contempt. We need not wonder if it should be taken from us; to many persons this, though the heavies of calamities, would occasion no grief. There are multitudes whom any profession would please as well as that of Christianity. But there are those who value the house, the word, and the ministry of God above their richest possessions, who dread the loss of these blessings more than death. How willing bad men are to shift off their convictions, and when they are in trouble, to believe it is a chance that happens; and that the rod has no voice which they should hear or heed!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Send it not empty - See the marginal references.

As they perceived they had either resolved upon, or at least were inclined to do; and which they also thought advisable and therefore would have them by no means send it away as it was, but with some presents along with it; for the meaning of this word "empty" is not that they should take care that all that were in it when taken should go with it, and nothing be taken out of it, or it be stripped of its contents; but that some gifts and offerings should be sent along with it: perhaps they might have some notion of, or respect unto a law in Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a> or might say this from a common principle received among Heathens, that deities were to be appeased by gifts (e): <p>but in any wise return him a trespass offering; here again they seem to have some notion of the sorts and kinds of sacrifice among the Israelites; and advise to a trespass offering, to make satisfaction and atonement for the offence they had committed in taking away the ark; and that they should make restoration not only by returning the ark, but by sending an expiatory offering along with it: <p>then ye shall be healed; of the disease with which they were smitten; for it seems it still continued on them, at least on many: <p>and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you; which was because the ark was detained by them; but when that should be sent home, and they be healed upon it, then it would be a plain case that the reason why the disease was inflicted and continued was because of that. <p>(e) "Munera crede mihi", &amp;c.
