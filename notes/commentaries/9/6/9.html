This strange experiment would satisfy the minds of the Philistine people. If the cows, contrary to their expectation, kept on the road to Bethshemesh, this would be a sign that they were driven and guided by a Divine power, and it would be clear to all that the Ark was a dangerous possession, and that they were well rid of it. They would be assured then that the scourge they were suffering from came from the angry Israelite Deity. If, on the other hand, the animals, left to themselves, returned to their own stalls, which, evidently, the diviners expected would be the case—then the Philistines might safely retain the Ark, being confident that their late sufferings were simply the results of natural causes. It will be remembered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-7.htm" title="Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:">1Samuel 6:7</a>) that these were milch cows, whose calves were shut up in the stall. The diviners felt quite sure that the cows, left to their own instincts, would, unless driven by some Divine power, come back to their young ones in the stall. What the priests and diviners advised was done, and the next two verses (10 and 11) relate how the restoration of the Ark was carried out in the way prescribed above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-9.htm" title="And see, if it goes up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.">1 Samuel 6:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">And see if it goeth up by his own coast — </span>Without any guide; <span class="ital">to Beth-shemesh — </span>A city in the tribe of Judah, in the confines of both countries. <span class="ital">Then he hath done this great evil — </span>Hath inflicted this sore calamity upon us.

Sinners lengthen out their own miseries by refusing to part with their sins. The Israelites made no effort to recover the ark. Alas! where shall we find concern for religion prevail above all other matters? In times of public calamity we fear for ourselves, for our families, and for our country; but who cares for the ark of God? We are favoured with the gospel, but it is treated with neglect or contempt. We need not wonder if it should be taken from us; to many persons this, though the heavies of calamities, would occasion no grief. There are multitudes whom any profession would please as well as that of Christianity. But there are those who value the house, the word, and the ministry of God above their richest possessions, who dread the loss of these blessings more than death. How willing bad men are to shift off their convictions, and when they are in trouble, to believe it is a chance that happens; and that the rod has no voice which they should hear or heed!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bethshemesh was the first Israelite town they would come to, being on the border of Judah.

Its position is identified by the modern village of <span class="ital">Ain Shems</span> (= “Fountain of the Sun”) in the <span class="ital">Wady es Sŭrâr</span>, and is described by Robinson as “a noble site for a city, a low plateau at the junction of two fine plains,” the “valley” in which the Beth-shemeshites were reaping their wheat (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-13.htm" title="And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.">1 Samuel 6:13</a></span>). “Here are vestiges of a former extensive city, consisting of many foundations and remains of ancient walls of hewn stone … Enough yet remains to make it one of the largest and most marked sites which we had anywhere seen.” <span class="ital">Biblical Researches</span>, II. 224.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Beth-shemesh was the scene of Amaziah’s defeat by Jehoash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/14-11.htm" title="But Amaziah would not hear.

If cows unaccustomed to the yoke drew the cart quietly; if in spite of their natural instincts they deserted their calves; if without human guidance they went straight to the nearest Israelite town; the obvious conclusion must be that they were controlled by a supernatural power, and that that power was the God of Israel. Compare Gideon’s ‘signs,’ consisting of phenomena contrary to expectation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-37.htm" title="Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the earth beside, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.">Jdg 6:37</a> ff.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His own coast,</span> or "border."

It was now a city of the priests, situated in the tribe of Judah, on its northeastern border, next the tribe of Dan, and was the nearest Israelite town to Ekron. If, then, the kine, albeit unused to the yoke, left their calves behind, and drew the cart by the most direct route unto the land of Judah, they would give the required proof that the Philistines were smitten by the hand of Jehovah, and that it was no chance that had happened unto them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Ark of God Sent Back. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-1.htm">1 Samuel 6:1-3</a>. The ark of Jehovah was in the land (lit. the fields, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a>) of the Philistines for seven months, and had brought destruction to all the towns to which it had been taken. At length the Philistines resolved to send it back to the Israelites, and therefore called their priests and diviners (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-23.htm">Numbers 23:23</a>) to ask them, "What shall we do with regard to the ark of God; tell us, with what shall we send it to its place?" "Its place" is the land of Israel, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; does not mean "in what manner" (quomodo: Vulgate, Thenius), but with what, wherewith (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6</a>). There is no force in the objection brought by Thenius, that if the question had implied with what presents, the priests would not have answered, "Do not send it without a present;" for the priests did not confine themselves to this answer, in which they gave a general assent, but proceeded at once to define the present more minutely. They replied, "If they send away the ark of the God of Israel (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; is to be taken as the third person in an indefinite address, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-24.htm">1 Samuel 2:24</a>, and not to be construed with &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; supplied), do not send it away empty (i.e., without an expiatory offering), but return Him (i.e., the God of Israel) a trespass-offering." &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, lit. guilt, then the gift presented as compensation for a fault, the trespass-offering (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14-6:7</a>). The gifts appointed by the Philistines as an asham were to serve as a compensation and satisfaction to be rendered to the God of Israel for the robbery committed upon Him by the removal of the ark of the covenant, and were therefore called asham, although in their nature they were only expiatory offerings. For the same reason the verb &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to return or repay, is used to denote the presentation of these gifts, being the technical expression for the payment of compensation for a fault in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-7.htm">Numbers 5:7</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a> for compensation for anything belonging to another, that had been unjustly appropriated. "Are ye healed then, it will show you why His hand is not removed from you," sc., so long as ye keep back the ark. The words &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1494; are to be understood as conditional, even without &#1488;&#1501;, which the rules of the language allow (see Ewald, 357, b.); this is required by the context. For, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>, the Philistine priests still thought it a possible thing that any misfortune which had befallen the Philistines might be only an accidental circumstance. With this view, they could not look upon a cure as certain to result from the sending back of the ark, but only as possible; consequently they could only speak conditionally, and with this the words "we shall know" agree. </body></html>
