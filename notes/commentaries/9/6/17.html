In the preceding chapter only Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron are mentioned as abiding places of the Ark, but there is no doubt that during the “seven months” the sacred chest was for a long or short period located in each of the five towns, in the Dagon temple which each of the cities possessed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:10-18 These two kine knew their owner, their great Owner, whom Hophin and Phinehas knew not. God's providence takes notice even of brute creatures, and serves its own purposes by them. When the reapers saw the ark, they rejoiced; their joy for that was greater than the joy of harvest. The return of the ark, and the revival of holy ordinances, after days of restraint and trouble, are matters of great joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word "Levites" here probably means priests <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14</a>, sons of Levi, since Bethshemesh was one of the cities of the priests <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13-16</a>. The burnt offering of the kine was not in any sense the offering of the men of Bethshemesh, but rather of the Philistine lords to whom the cart and the kine belonged. But the Bethshemites themselves, in token of their gratitude for such a signal mercy, now offered both burnt offerings and sacrifices, probably peace offerings, and doubtless feasted together with great joy and gladness (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62-66</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-17</a>). There is nothing whatever in the text to indicate that these sacrifices were offered otherwise than in the appointed way by the priests. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18. And these are the golden emerods &#8230; and the mice&#8212;There were five representative images of the emerods, corresponding to the five principal cities of the Philistines.

We have here a specific description of the propitiatory offering actually sent; (<span class="ital">a</span>) a golden “boil” for each chief city: (<span class="ital">b</span>) a golden mouse for each city and village throughout the whole country.

The reason for the offering of mice from the whole country probably was that the plague of mice had ravaged the whole country, while the pestilence was chiefly confined to the great cities.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fenced cities</span>] Fortified or walled cities, contrasted with the “country villages” or unwalled towns.

But there is no mention of such a name having been given to it: it is scarcely natural that this stone should be taken as the boundary of the land of the Philistines: and the sentence as it stands is ungrammatical. It seems best to follow the Targum and Sept. in reading “stone” instead of Abel, and to make a slight further alteration of the text, by which we obtain good sense and grammar: either (<span class="ital">a</span>) “And <span class="bld">the great stone</span> whereon they set down the ark of the Lord is <span class="bld">a witness</span> unto this day in the field of Joshua the <span class="bld">Beth-shemeshite.</span>” (Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-52.htm" title="This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.">Genesis 31:52</a>): or (<span class="ital">b</span>) “<span class="bld">The great stone … remaineth</span> unto this day.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The golden emerods.</span> We have here and in ver. 18 an enumeration of the gifts differing from, without being at variance with, that in ver. 4. They are still five golden emerods, for which the name here is not <span class="accented">ophalim</span>, but <span class="accented">tehorim</span>, the word always read in the synagogue (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>). From  its use in the cognate languages it is pretty certain that it is rightly translated in our version. But besides these there were <span class="cmt_word">golden mice, according to the number of all the cities,</span> etc. The priests had named only five mice, one for each of the lords of the Philistines; but the eagerness of the people outran their suggestion, and not only the fenced towns, but even the unwalled villages sent their offering, lest they should still be chastised. <span class="cmt_word">Country villages.</span> Literally, "the village" or "hamlet of the Perazi." The Septuagint, a trustworthy authority in such matters, makes the Perazi the same as the Perizzite. Both words really signify "the inhabitant of the lowland," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the plain country of Phoenicia; but from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>, where Perazoth is translated "towns without walls," and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>, where it is rendered "unwalled villages," we may conclude that it had come popularly to mean an open village, though literally, in both these places, it means "the hamlets of the lowland." <span class="cmt_word">Even unto the great stone of Abel,</span> etc. All this part of the verse is exceedingly corrupt, and requires large interpolations to obtain from it any meaning. Both the Vulgate and the Syriac retain the unmeaning word Abel; but the Septuagint gives us what is probably the true reading: "and the great stone whereon they set the ark of Jehovah, which is in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite, is a witness unto this day" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-52.htm">Genesis 31:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The God of Israel actually did what the idolatrous priests hardly considered possible. When the Philistines, in accordance with the advice given them by their priests, had placed the ark of the covenant and the expiatory gifts upon the cart to which the two cows were harnessed, "the cows went straight forward on the way to Bethshemesh; they went along a road going and lowing (i.e., lowing the whole time), and turned not to the right or to the left; and the princes of the Philistines went behind them to the territory of Bethshemesh." &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, lit., "they were straight in the way," i.e., they went straight along the road. The form &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; is the imperf. Kal, third pers. plur. fem., with the preformative &#1497; instead of &#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-38.htm">Genesis 30:38</a> (see Ges. 47, Anm. 3; Ewald, 191, b.). Bethshemesh, the present Ain-shems, was a priests' city on the border of Judah and Dan (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>). </body></html>
