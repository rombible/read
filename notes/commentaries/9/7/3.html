They were both favourite Phœnician deities, known under the familiar names of Baal, Bil, Bel, and Ashtaroth, Astarte, Istar. They represented the productive power of nature, and were generally worshipped throughout the East, usually with a wild and wanton worship.<p><span class= "bld">Prepare your hearts.</span>—It was, indeed, a desperate venture seemingly, this, to which the prophet summoned unarmed and undisciplined Israel. They were then completely at the mercy of their long victorious foes, who held the chief fortified places in the country with their garrisons; and Samuel challenged Israel to bid defiance to the most cherished institutions of their oppressors, bade them, if they loved the Eternal, to turn aside from reverencing what Philistia held to be sacred and all-powerful. He knew well that what he urged upon the people would at once provoke what appeared to be a dangerous and most unequal contest. If defeated, then Israel would bring upon their devoted heads utter misery, and a ruin hitherto undreamed of even in their unhappy land. Had they courage and faith to plunge unarmed, undisciplined, into so perilous a contest? For twenty years the great patriot-statesman had laboured for this end. He had succeeded at last in opening the eyes of Israel to see the real cause of their misfortunes. He had made them as a nation hunger for the lost presence of the Eternal, who had loved them in past days with so great a love; and now, after twenty long slow years, was his work done at last? They sorrowed indeed for their national sins; but had they faith and courage, all unarmed as they were, to rise against the powerful enemies of purity and God?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm" title="And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.">1 Samuel 7:3</a>. </span><span class="ital">Samuel spake to all the house of Israel </span>— To all the rulers and people too, as he had occasion in his circuit, described below, mixing exhortations to repentance with his judicial administrations. <span class="ital">If ye return unto the Lord — </span>If you do indeed what you profess, if you be resolved to go on in that which you seem to have begun; <span class="ital">with all your heart — </span>Sincerely and in good earnest; <span class="ital">put away the strange gods — </span>Out of your houses, where some of you keep them; and out of your hearts, where they still have an interest in many of you; <span class="ital">and Ashtaroth — </span>Especially Ashtaroth, whom they, together with the neighbouring nations, did more eminently worship. <span class="ital">Prepare your hearts — </span>By purging them from all sin, and particularly from all inclinations to other gods.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-4 God will find a resting-place for his ark; if some thrust it from them, the hearts of others shall be inclined to receive it. It is no new thing for God's ark to be in a private house. Christ and his apostles preached from house to house, when they could not have public places. Twenty years passed before the house of Israel cared for the want of the ark. During this time the prophet Samuel laboured to revive true religion. The few words used are very expressive; and this was one of the most effectual revivals of religion which ever took place in Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references.

The Israelites, through Samuel's Influence, Solemnly Repent at Mizpeh.<p>3-6. Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel&#8212;A great national reformation was effected through the influence of Samuel. Disgusted with their foreign servitude, and panting for the restoration of liberty and independence, they were open to salutary impressions; and convinced of their errors, they renounced idolatry. The re-establishment of the faith of their fathers was inaugurated at a great public meeting, held at Mizpeh in Judah, and hallowed by the observance of impressive religious solemnities. The drawing water, and pouring it out before the Lord, seems to have been a symbolical act by which, in the people's name, Samuel testified their sense of national corruption, their need of that moral purification of which water is the emblem, and their sincere desire to pour out their hearts in repentance before God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto all the house of Israel; </span> to all the rulers and people too, as he had occasion in his circuit, described below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.">1 Samuel 7:16</a></span>, mixing exhortations to repentance with his judicial administrations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If ye do return unto the Lord; </span> if you do indeed what you profess, if you are resolved to go on in that which you seem to have begun. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With all your heart; </span> sincerely and in good earnest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Put away the strange gods out of your houses, </span> where some of you keep and worship them; and out of your hearts and affections, where they still have an interest in many of you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And Ashtaroth; </span> and particularly or especially <span class="ital">Ashtaroth</span>, which he mentions as a god, whom they, together with the neighbouring nations, did more eminently worship.

When they assembled at one of their three yearly feasts, or as he went from place to place, exhorting them to repentance and reformation; and perceiving they began to be awakened to a sense of their sins, and seemed desirous of returning to God, and restoring his worship: <p>saying, if ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts; truly and sincerely; for he might fear there was hypocrisy and dissimulation at least in some of them: <p>then put away the strange gods; as all but the true God are; or the gods of another people, as the Philistines, Canaanites, &amp;c.

Samuel's secret addresses had no doubt been watched with anger by the Philistines, but he now ventures upon open resistance; for this public summons to Israel to put away its idols by a national act was a summons also to an uprise against foreign domination. We must suppose that the people had often assured Samuel in his wanderings of the reality of their repentance, and of their readiness to stake everything upon the issue of war. As a statesman, he now judges that the time has come, and convenes a national assembly. But everything would depend upon their earnestness. They were virtually unarmed; they would have to deal with an enemy long victorious, and who held the most important posts in their country with garrisons. Terrible suffering would follow upon defeat. Was their faith strong enough, their courage desperate enough, for so fearful a risk? Especially as Samuel is never described to us as a warrior or military hero. He could inspire no confidence as a general. He himself makes everything depend upon theft faith, and all he can promise is, "I will pray for you unto Jehovah" (ver. 5). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm">1 Samuel 6:15</a> contains a supplementary remark, therefore &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; is to be translated as a pluperfect. After sacrificing the cart, with the cows, as a burnt-offering to the Lord, the inhabitants of Bethshemesh gave a further practical expression to their joy at the return of the ark, by offering burnt-offerings and slain-offerings in praise of God. In the burnt-offerings they consecrated themselves afresh, with all their members, to the service of the Lord; and in the slain-offerings, which culminated in the sacrificial meals, they sealed anew their living fellowship with the Lord. The offering of these sacrifices at Bethshemesh was no offence against the commandment, to sacrifice to the Lord at the place of His sanctuary alone. The ark of the covenant was the throne of the gracious presence of God, before which the sacrifices were really offered at the tabernacle. The Lord had sanctified the ark afresh as the throne of His presence, by the miracle which He had wrought in bringing it back again. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a> the different atoning presents, which the Philistines sent to Jehovah as compensation, are enumerated once more: viz., five golden boils, one for each of their five principal towns (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>), and "golden mice, according to the number of all the Philistian towns of the five princes, from the fortified city to the village of the inhabitants of the level land" (perazi; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>). The priests had only proposed that five golden mice should be sent as compensation, as well as five boils (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4</a>). But the Philistines offered as many images of mice as there were towns and villages in their five states, no doubt because the plague of mice had spread over the whole land, whereas the plague of boils had only fallen upon the inhabitants of those towns to which the ark of the covenant had come. In this way the apparent discrepancy between <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a> is very simply removed. The words which follow, viz., &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "upon which they had set down the ark," show unmistakeably, when compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-14.htm">1 Samuel 6:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm">1 Samuel 6:15</a>, that we are to understand by &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1500; the great stone upon which the ark was placed when it was taken off the cart. The conjecture of Kimchi, that this stone was called Abel (luctus), on account of the mourning which took place there (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>), is extremely unnatural. Consequently there is no other course left than to regard &#1488;&#1489;&#1500; as an error in writing for &#1488;&#1489;&#1503;, according to the reading, or at all events the rendering, adopted by the lxx and Targum. But &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; (even unto) is quite unsuitable here, as no further local definition is required after the foregoing &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, and it is impossible to suppose that the Philistines offered a golden mouse as a trespass-offering for the great stone upon which the ark was placed. We must therefore alter &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; into &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;: "And the great stone is witness (for &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; in this sense, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-52.htm">Genesis 31:52</a>) to this day in the field of Joshua the Bethshemeshite," sc., of the fact just described. </body></html>
