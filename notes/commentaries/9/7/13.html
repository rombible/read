It was no mere solitary victory, this success of Israel at Ebenezer, but was the sign of a new spirit in Israel, which animated the nation during the lifetime of Samuel, and the reigns of David and Solomon and the great Hebrew kings. The petty jealousies had disappeared, and had given place to a great national desire for unity. In the several tribal districts it was no longer the glory and prosperity of Judah, Ephraim, or Benjamin, but the glory and prosperity of Israel that was aimed at. The old idol worship of Canaan, which corrupted and degraded every nationality which practised it, was in a great measure swept away from among the chosen people, while the pure religion of the Eternal of Hosts was no longer confided solely to the care and guardianship of the tribe of Levi, which had shown itself unworthy of the mighty trust. The Levites still ministered in the sanctuary, and when the Temple took its place, alone officiated in its sacred courts; and the chosen race of Aaron, in the family first of Ithamar, then of Eleazar, alone wore the jewels and the official robe of the high priest; but in religious matters the power of the priestly tribe was never again supreme in the Land of Promise. From the days of Samuel a new order—that of the Prophets, whose exact functions with regard to the ritual of the worship of the Eternal were undefined—was acknowledged by the people as the regular medium of communication with the Jewish King of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">The hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.</span>—The Philistines never entirely recovered their supremacy in Canaan. There was. it is true, a long fierce struggle, but with the exception of the short period which immediately preceded the election of Saul, and the temporary disasters of the children of Israel which were the punishments of that king’s disobedience—from this time forward the power of the Philistines gradually decayed. while the strength of Israel steadily increased, until King David completely subdued them, and the old oppressors of Israel were absorbed into the subject races of Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm" title="So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.">1 Samuel 7:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Came no more — </span>That is, with a great host, but only molested them with straggling parties, or garrisons. <span class="ital">All the days of Samuel — </span>That is, while Samuel was their sole judge, or ruler; for in Saul’s time they did come.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:13-17 In this great revival of true religion, the ark was neither removed to Shiloh, nor placed with the tabernacle any where else.

We must then understand the statement in the text as either (<span class="ital">a</span>) “a general expression allowable in such a brief survey as is here given:” or (<span class="ital">b</span>) as referring only to the period of Samuel’s active judgeship. In the latter case we may conjecture that the Philistines re-established their ascendancy in his old age, in consequence of the weak and corrupt government of his sons.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the Philistines were subdued.</span> Not completely, for we find that they had garrisons in Israel when Saul was made king; but it was a thorough victory for the time, and was followed up, moreover, by an invasion of Philistia, in which Samuel recovered the towns which had been wrested from Israel upon the western borders of Judah and Benjamin. Moreover, the enemy <span class="cmt_word">came no more into the coast of Israel.</span> That is, all invasions ceased. <span class="cmt_word">And the hand of Jehovah was against the philistines all the days of Samuel.</span> This, of course, includes the reign of Saul, till within four years of his death; for Samuel continued to he prophet, and to a certain extent shophet, even when Saul was king. The words, moreover, imply a struggle, during which there was a gradual growth in strength on Israel's part, and a gradual enfeeblement on the part of the Philistines, until David completely vanquished them, though they appear again as powerful enemies in the days of King Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>). It is certain, however, that fifteen or twenty years after this battle the Philistines were again in the ascendant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-23</a>), and it was this which made the Israelites demand a king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>). But it is the method of the Divine historians to include the ultimate results, however distant, in their account of an event (see on 1 Samuel 16:21; 17:55-58); and Israel's freedom and the final subjugation of the Philistines were both contained in Samuel's victory at Mizpah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they had assembled together here, "they drew water and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord." Drawing water and pouring it out before Jehovah was a symbolical act, which has been thus correctly explained by the Chaldee, on the whole: "They poured out their heart like water in penitence before the Lord." This is evident from the figurative expressions, "poured out like water," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>, and "pour out thy heart like water," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>, which are used to denote inward dissolution through pain, misery, and distress (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>). Hence the pouring out of water before God was a symbolical representation of the temporal and spiritual distress in which they were at the time, - a practical confession before God, "Behold, we are before Thee like water that has been poured out;" and as it was their own sin and rebellion against God that had brought this distress upon them, it was at the same time a confession of their misery, and an act of the deepest humiliation before the Lord. They gave a still further practical expression to this humiliation by fasting (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), as a sign of their inward distress of mind on account of their sin, and an oral confession of their sin against the Lord. By the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which is added to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "they said "there," i.e., at Mizpeh, the oral confession of their sin is formally separated from the two symbolical acts of humiliation before God, though by this very separation it is practically placed on a par with them. What they did symbolically by the pouring out of water and fasting, they explained and confirmed by their verbal confession. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is never an adverb of time signifying "then;" neither in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>, nor <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>. "And thus Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpeh." &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; does not mean "he became judge" (Mich. and others), any more than "he punished every one according to his iniquity" (Thenius, after David Kimchi). Judging the people neither consisted in a censure pronounced by Samuel afterwards, nor in absolution granted to the penitent after they had made a confession of their sin, but in the fact that Samuel summoned the nation to Mizpeh to humble itself before Jehovah, and there secured for it, through his intercession, the forgiveness of its sin, and a renewal of the favour of its God, and thus restored the proper relation between Israel and its God, so that the Lord could proceed to vindicate His people's rights against their foes.<p>When the Philistines heard of the gathering of the Israelites at Mizpeh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8</a>), their princes went up against Israel to make war upon it; and the Israelites, in their fear of the Philistines, entreated Samuel, "Do not cease to cry for us to the Lord our God, that He may save us out of the hand of the Philistines." <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>. "And Samuel took a milk-lamb (a lamb that was still sucking, probably, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-27.htm">Leviticus 22:27</a>, a lamb seven days old), and offered it whole as a burnt-offering to the Lord." &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is used adverbially, according to its original meaning as an adverb, "whole." The Chaldee has not given the word at all, probably because the translators regarded it as pleonastic, since every burnt-offering was consumed upon the altar whole, and consequently the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; was sometimes used in a substantive sense, as synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-21.htm">Psalm 51:21</a>). But in the passage before us, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is not synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, but simply affirms that the lamb was offered upon the altar without being cut up or divided. Samuel selected a young lamb for the burnt-offering, not "as being the purest and most innocent kind of sacrificial animal," - for it cannot possibly be shown that very young animals were regarded as purer than those that were full-grown, - but as being the most suitable to represent the nation that had wakened up to new life through its conversion to the Lord, and was, as it were, new-born. For the burnt-offering represented the man, who consecrated therein his life and labour to the Lord. The sacrifice was the substratum for prayer. When Samuel offered it, he cried to the Lord for the children of Israel; and the Lord "answered," i.e., granted, his prayer.</body></html>
