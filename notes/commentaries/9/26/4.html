How helpless were Saul and all his men! All as though disarmed and chained, yet nothing is done to them; they are only asleep. How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thought fit to avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to the promised crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong; but if he yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted the temptation, and trusted God with the event.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The incident related in this chapter of the meeting between Saul and David bears a strong general resemblance to that recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24.htm">1 Samuel 24</a>, and is of a nature unlikely to have occurred more than once. Existing discrepancies are explained by the supposition that one narrative relates fully some incidents on which the other is silent. On the whole the most probable conclusion is that the two narratives relate to one and the same event. (Compare the two narratives of the Creation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> ff; the two narratives of David's war, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a>; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10</a>; and those of the death of Ahaziah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a> ff; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-9.htm">2 Chronicles 22:9</a>.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.
