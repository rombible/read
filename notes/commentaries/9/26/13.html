Keil calls attention here to the special notice in the text that the mountain whence David spoke was afar off, not, as we should say, “as the crow flies,” but afar, because a deep steep ravine lay between the camp of Saul and the hill on which David and Abishai stood. “On the previous occasion when, in the cave of En-gedi, the son of Jesse cut off the skirt of the royal garment, David fearlessly cried to Saul when the king was still evidently quite close to the cave. <span class= "ital">Now, </span>however, he seems to have reckoned far less upon any change in the state of Saul’s mind than he had done before . . . in fact, he rather feared lest Saul should endeavour to get him into his power as soon as he woke from his sleep.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/26-13.htm" title="Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:...">1 Samuel 26:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">And stood on the top of a hill — </span>On such a rock or precipice that there was no coming to him but by taking a circuit round.

Those who forbid our attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange us from God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposes us to sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirred thee up against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way to punish me for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; let Him accept an offering from us both. Let us join in seeking peace, and to be reconciled with God by sacrifice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ahimelech the Hittite - Only mentioned here.

Then David &#8230; stood on the top of an hill afar off &#8230; and cried to the people&#8212;(See on [252]Jud 9:7). The extraordinary purity and elasticity of the air in Palestine enable words to be distinctly heard that are addressed by a speaker from the top of one hill to people on that of another, from which it is separated by a deep intervening ravine. Hostile parties can thus speak to each other, while completely beyond the reach of each other's attack. It results from the peculiar features of the country in many of the mountain districts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That his person might be out of their reach, and yet his voice might be heard; which in a clear air, and in the silence of the night, might be heard at a great distance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then David went over to the other side,.... To a hill on the other side, opposite to Hachilah, where Saul lay encamped; or "passed over the passage" (q), the valley that lay between the two hills, and perhaps passed over a brook that ran in the valley, which is not unusual; so Josephus (r) says, that he went over a brook and came to the top of a mountain: <p>and stood on the top of an hill afar off; he chose the top of an hill, that his voice might be heard at a distance, as it might in a clear air, and still night; and to be afar off, that he might the better make his escape, should an attempt be made to pursue him: <p>a great space being between them; a large valley lying between the two hills. <p>(q)  "et transivit transitum", Montanus.

David’s final expostulation with Saul<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">a great space being between them</span>] This precaution indicates that David trusted Saul less now than upon the former occasion.

Here Saul had his army round him, and David had entered his camp by stealth. It is not, therefore, till he had placed an ample interval between them that he calls to <span class="cmt_word">Abner</span>, and asks in derision, <span class="cmt_word">Art thou not a man?</span> The irony is enfeebled by the insertion of  the word <span class="accented">valiant</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>). No special valour was needed;any one worthy of the name of man ought to have guarded his master better. <span class="cmt_word">Who is like to thee</span> - Hebrew, "who is as thou"  -  <span class="cmt_word">in Israel?</span> Among all Saul's subjects there was no one so powerful and highly placed as the commander-in-chief, and he ought to have shown himself worthy of his pre-eminence. Justly, therefore, for neglecting his duty and exposing the king to danger, he and his people were <span class="cmt_word">worthy to die.</span> Hebrew, "sons of death" (see on 1 Samuel 20:31). Finally David bids him search for the king's spear and water bottle, that he may understand how completely Saul had been in his power. It has been suggested that Abner was probably a personal enemy of David, with whom he could never have held the high position which he occupied with his near relative Saul. Possibly instead of dissuading Saul from persecuting David, he stirred up his ill feelings. Still absolutely there is nothing in this banter which was not justified by Abner's official position. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Upon the receipt of this information, David rose up with two attendants (mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-6.htm">1 Samuel 26:6</a>) to reconnoitre the camp of Saul. When he saw the place where Saul and his general Abner were lying - Saul was lying by the waggon rampart, and the fighting men were encamped round about him - he said to Ahimelech and Abishai, "Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?" Whereupon Abishai declared himself ready to do so; and they both went by night, and found Saul sleeping with all the people. Ahimelech the Hittite is never mentioned again; but Abishai the son of Zeruiah, David's sister (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">1 Chronicles 2:16</a>), and a brother of Joab, was afterwards a celebrated general of David, as was also his brother Joab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-2.htm">2 Samuel 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>). Saul's spear was pressed (stuck) into the ground at his head, as a sign that the king was sleeping there, for the spear served Saul as a sceptre (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>).</body></html>
