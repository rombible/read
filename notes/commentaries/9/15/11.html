But as a man desires to make a change when he repents, so when God is said in Scripture to repent, we may expect a change from Him. He changed Saul’s kingdom when it is said He repented of making him king.”—<span class= "ital">Bishop Wordsworth.</span><p><span class= "bld">And it grieved Samuel</span>—“Many grave thoughts seem to have presented themselves at once to Samuel, and to have disturbed his mind when he reflected on the dishonour which would be inflicted upon the name of God, and the occasion which the rejection and deposition of Saul would furnish to wicked men for blaspheming the invisible King of Israel . . . For Saul had been chosen by God Himself from all the people, and called by Him to the throne; if, therefore, he was deposed, it seemed likely that the worship of God would be overturned, and the greatest disturbance ensue.”—<span class= "ital">Calvin, quoted by Keil. </span>Abarbanel tells us respecting Samuel’s grief that he was angry and displeased, because he loved Saul for his beauty and heroism, and as his own creature whom he had made king; and that he prayed all night because God had not revealed to him Saul’s sin, and he wished to know why sentence was pronounced against him.<p><span class= "bld">And he cried unto the Lord all night.</span>—This was, no doubt, that “piercing shrill cry” peculiar to Samuel. With this strange cry he seems to have on many a solemn occasion spoken with his God. He is often in this book represented as thus “crying unto God.” (See Stanley’s <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church, </span>Vol. I., 1 Samuel 18)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm" title="It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.

The change was in Saul; He is turned back from following me. Hereby he made God his enemy. Samuel spent a whole night in pleading for Saul. The rejection of sinners is the grief of believers: God delights not in their death, nor should we. Saul boasts to Samuel of his obedience. Thus sinners think, by justifying themselves, to escape being judged of the Lord. The noise the cattle made, like the rust of the silver, Jas 5:3, witnessed against him. Many boast of obedience to the command of God; but what means then their indulgence of the flesh, their love of the world, their angry and unkind spirit, and their neglect of holy duties, which witness against them? See of what evil covetousness is the root; and see what is the sinfulness of sin, and notice that in it which above any thing else makes it evil in the sight of the Lord; it is disobedience: Thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord. Carnal, deceitful hearts, like Saul, think to excuse themselves from God's commandments by what pleases themselves. It is hard to convince the children of disobedience. But humble, sincere, and conscientious obedience to the will of God, is more pleasing and acceptable to him than all burnt-offering and sacrifices. God is more glorified and self more denied, by obedience than by sacrifice. It is much easier to bring a bullock or lamb to be burned upon the altar, than to bring every high thought into obedience to God, and to make our will subject to his will. Those are unfit and unworthy to rule over men, who are not willing that God should rule over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It grieved Samuel - "Samuel was angry, or displeased," as Jonah was <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-1.htm">Jonah 4:1</a>, and for a similar reason.

Saul’s disobedience and its penalty<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">It repenteth me</span>] “God’s repentance is the change of His dispensation.” In the language of the O. T. God is said to repent when a change in the character and conduct of those with whom He is dealing leads to a corresponding change in His plans and purposes towards them. Thus (<span class="ital">a</span>) upon man’s penitence God repents and withdraws a threatened punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-14.htm" title="And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.">Exodus 32:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2 Samuel 24:16</a>): (<span class="ital">b</span>) upon man’s faithlessness and disobedience He cancels a promise or revokes a blessing which He had given. The opposite is also true, “God is not a man that he should repent” (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1 Samuel 15:29</a></span>). His repentance is not to be understood as though He who foreknows all things <span class="ital">regretted</span> His action, nor is it a sign of mutability. A change in the attitude of man to God necessarily involves a corresponding change in the attitude of God to man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">it grieved Samuel</span>] This rendering is probably right, though the word more commonly means “to be angry.” Samuel was grieved at the failure of one from whom he had hoped for so much advantage to the nation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he cried unto the Lord all night</span>] Interceding for Saul if perchance he might he forgiven. For Samuel’s intercessions see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm" title="And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.">1 Samuel 7:5</a>, and compare Moses’ pleading for Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-11.htm" title="And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?...">Exodus 32:11-13</a>). Our Lord “continued all night in prayer to God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It repenteth me.</span> By the law of man's free will his concurrence is necessary in carrying out the Divine purpose, and consequently every man called to the execution of any such purpose undergoes a probation. God's purpose will be finally carried out, but each special instrument, if it prove unworthy, will be laid aside. This change of administration is always described in Scriptural language as God's repentance, possibly because the phrase contains also the idea of the Divine grief over the rebellious sinner. But though Saul and his dynasty were thus put aside, and no longer represented Jehovah, still Saul remained the actual king, because God works slowly by the natural sequence of cause and effect. Saul's ill-governed temper, and his hatred and malice towards David, were the means of bringing about his ruin. <span class="cmt_word">It grieved Samuel.</span> Hebrew, "it burned to Samuel," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he was angry and displeased. The same phrase occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-1.htm">Jonah 4:1</a>, where it is rendered "he was very angry." But with whom was Samuel vexed? Generally at the whole course  of events, but especially with Saul. In choosing him he had hoped that, in addition to high military qualities, he would possess a religious and obedient heart. He had now obtained for him a second trial, and if, warned by his earlier failure, he had proved trustworthy all might have been well. Saul had too many noble gifts for Samuel to feel indifferent at the perversion of so great an intellect and so heroic a heart. But he was of a despotic temperament, and would bend to no will but his own; and so he had saved the best of the plunder to enrich the people, and Agag possibly as a proof of his personal triumph. <span class="cmt_word">And he cried unto Jehovah all night</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he offered an earnest prayer for forgiveness for Saul, and for a change in his heart. As Abravanel says, Samuel no doubt loved Saul for his beauty and heroism, and therefore prayed for him; but no change came in answer to his prayer, and as forgiveness is conditional upon man's repentance, Saul was not forgiven. It is remarkable how often Samuel is represented as "crying" unto God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He then advanced as far as the city of the Amalekites, the situation of which is altogether unknown, and placed an ambush in the valley. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489; does not come from &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, to fight, i.e., to quarrel, not to give battle, but was understood even by the early translators as a contracted form of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;, the Hiphil of &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;.
