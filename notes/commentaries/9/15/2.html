They were descended from Esau’s grandson, Amalek. Not long after the exodus from Egypt, they attacked and cruelly harassed the almost defenceless rear-guard of Israel in the desert of Rephidim. They were then, at the prayer of Moses, defeated by Joshua; but, for this cowardly unprovoked attack, solemnly doomed to destruction. In the prophecy of Balaam they are alluded to as the first of the nations who opposed the Lord’s people. During the stormy ages that followed, the hand of Amalek seems to have been constantly lifted against Israel, and we read of them perpetually as allied to their relentless foes.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The sentence of condemnation against the Amalekites had gone forth long before, Ex 17:14; De 25:19, but they had been spared till they filled up the measure of their sins. We are sure that the righteous Lord does no injustice to any. The remembering the kindness of the ancestors of the Kenites, in favour to them, at the time God was punishing the injuries done by the ancestors of the Amalekites, tended to clear the righteousness of God in this dispensation. It is dangerous to be found in the company of God's enemies, and it is our duty and interest to come out from among them, lest we share in their sins and plagues, Re 18:4. As the commandment had been express, and a test of Saul's obedience, his conduct evidently was the effect of a proud, rebellious spirit. He destroyed only the refuse, that was good for little. That which was now destroyed was sacrificed to the justice of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references.

Their territory extended over the whole of the eastern portion of the desert of Sinai to Rephidim&#8212;the earliest opponent (De 25:18; Ex 17:8-16)&#8212;the hereditary and restless enemy of Israel (Nu 14:45; Jud 3:13; 6:3), and who had not repented (1Sa 14:48) of their bitter and sleepless hatred during the five hundred years that had elapsed since their doom was pronounced. Being a people of nomadic habits, they were as plundering and dangerous as the Bedouin Arabs, particularly to the southern tribes. The national interest required, and God, as King of Israel, decreed that this public enemy should be removed. Their destruction was to be without reservation or exception.<p>I remember&#8212;I am reminded of what Amalek did&#8212;perhaps by the still remaining trophy or memorial erected by Moses (Ex 17:15, 16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I seem to have forgotten, but now I will show that I remember, and now will revenge, those old injuries done four hundred years ago, which now I will punish in their children; which was the more just, because they continued in their parents’ cruel practices, below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.

According to one view they had migrated from the East: according to another they were the descendants of Esau’s grandson Amalek (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a>). They were a nomad people, roaming over the wilderness which lies to the south and south-west of Palestine and stretches down into the peninsula of Sinai. They disputed the passage of the Israelites, but were signally defeated at Rephidim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm" title="Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.">Exodus 17:8</a>). Upon a later occasion they joined with the Canaanites, and were victorious in a battle near Hormah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm" title="Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.">Numbers 14:45</a>). In league with the Moabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Jdg 3:13</a>) and Midianites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Jdg 6:3</a>) they continued to harass the Israelites alter their entrance into Canaan. As the first of the heathen nations who opposed the progress of God’s people after the Exodus they were doomed to utter destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-16.htm" title="For he said, Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.">Exodus 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.">Numbers 24:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/25-17.htm" title="Remember what Amalek did to you by the way, when you were come forth out of Egypt;...">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>), and the time had now come for the execution of this sentence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amalek</span>. The Amalekites were a fierce race of nomads who inhabited the desert to the south of Judaea towards Egypt. They were, and still continue to be in their descendants, the Bedouins, an untamable race of savages, whose delight is in robbery and plunder. Between them and Israel there was bitter hostility occasioned by their having attacked the people immediately after the Exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>), and the command there given to exterminate them is repeated now, probably in consequence of their raids having become more numerous and sanguinary under their present king, as we gather from ver. 33. The reference to a war with the Amalektes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a> no doubt refers to this expedition, as we have there a mere summary of Saul's military enterprises. <span class="cmt_word">I remember.</span> Literally, "I have visited;" but the sense of <span class="accented">remembering</span> seems confirmed by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>. The Septuagint, however, and Aquila, give a very good sense: "I have considered, "thought over." <span class="cmt_word">How he laid wait for him in the way.</span> There is no idea in the Hebrew of ambuscade or treachery. It is simply, "How he set himself in the way against him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> opposed, withstood him, tried to bar his progress. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And he acquired power;" &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>) does not merely signify he proved himself brave, or he formed an army, but denotes the development and unfolding of power in various respects. Here it relates more particularly to the development of strength in the war against Amalek, by virtue of which Saul smote this arch-enemy of Israel, and put an end to their depredations. This war is described more fully in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, on account of its consequences in relation to Saul's own sovereignty.</body></html>
