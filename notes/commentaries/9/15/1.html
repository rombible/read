God here refers to that most notorious instance of cruelty, inhumanity, and impiety, their invading and destroying, as far as in them lay, by treachery and surprise, and that uninjured and unprovoked, the people of Israel, when they were coming out of Egypt, and were manifestly under the immediate and miraculous protection of Almighty God. “This was a sin,” says Dr. Delaney, “at once so inhuman and so atheistical, as perhaps cannot be paralleled in any one instance from the foundation of the world, and therefore it is no wonder if this flagrant act of villany and impiety produced that dreadful decree against them, recorded <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>, <span class="ital">I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven: </span>and again, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-16.htm" title="Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the LORD has said to me this night.

And that this was the case of the Amalekites, sufficiently appears from their history. For, as their fathers attempted upon the Israelites, when under the manifest protection of God, their sons continued to do the same upon every occasion, though the same protection became every day more and more conspicuous by many and repeated instances.” <span class="ital">When he came out of Egypt</span> <span class="ital">— </span>When he was newly come out of cruel and long bondage, and was now weak, and weary, and faint, and hungry, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-18.htm" title="How he met you by the way, and smote the hindmost of you, even all that were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he feared not God.">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>; and therefore it was barbarous, instead of that pity which even nature prompted them to afford, to add affliction to the afflicted; it was also horrid impiety to fight against God himself, and to lift up <span class="ital">their hand </span>in a <span class="ital">manner, against the Lord’s throne, </span>while they struck at that people which God had brought forth in so stupendous a way.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 The sentence of condemnation against the Amalekites had gone forth long before, Ex 17:14; De 25:19, but they had been spared till they filled up the measure of their sins. We are sure that the righteous Lord does no injustice to any. The remembering the kindness of the ancestors of the Kenites, in favour to them, at the time God was punishing the injuries done by the ancestors of the Amalekites, tended to clear the righteousness of God in this dispensation. It is dangerous to be found in the company of God's enemies, and it is our duty and interest to come out from among them, lest we share in their sins and plagues, Re 18:4. As the commandment had been express, and a test of Saul's obedience, his conduct evidently was the effect of a proud, rebellious spirit. He destroyed only the refuse, that was good for little. That which was now destroyed was sacrificed to the justice of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The absence of all chronology or note of time is remarkable. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>1Sa 15:1-6.

Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee &#8230;: now therefore hearken thou unto &#8230; the Lord&#8212;Several years had been passed in successful military operations against troublesome neighbors. During these Saul had been left to act in a great measure at his own discretion as an independent prince. Now a second test is proposed of his possessing the character of a theocratic monarch in Israel; and in announcing the duty required of him, Samuel brought before him his official station as the Lord's vicegerent, and the peculiar obligation under which he was laid to act in that capacity. He had formerly done wrong, for which a severe rebuke and threatening were administered to him (1Sa 13:13, 14). Now an opportunity was afforded him of retrieving that error by an exact obedience to the divine command.Samuel sendeth Saul to destroy the Amalekites: his army, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/15-1.htm" title="Samuel also said to Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of the LORD....">1 Samuel 15:1-5</a></span>.

When and where he said to him what follows, it is not easy to determine, perhaps at Gilgal, where they after met again: <p>the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel; that is, he gave him orders to anoint him king of Israel, otherwise Saul was in providence sent to Samuel to be anointed, and not Samuel to Saul: <p>now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord; for so great a favour, and such high honour he had conferred on him, laid him under great obligation to obey the commands of the Lord; and whereas he had been deficient in one instance before, for which he had been reproved, he suggests, that now he should take care to observe and do, particularly and punctually, what should be enjoined him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee <i>to be</i> king over his people, over Israel: now therefore <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.</span><p>(a) Because he has preferred you to this honour, you are bound to obey him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/15-1.htm" title="Samuel also said to Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of the LORD....">1 Samuel 15:1-9</a>.

The prophet appeals to his former commission to anoint Saul as accrediting him to be God’s messenger on the present occasion. “The note of special warning” with which he prefaces the command indicates that he felt that “the discipline of Saul’s life was gathering itself up into a special trial,” and that this would be “a crisis in that life-history, with which by God’s own hand his own had been so strangely intertwined.” Wilberforce’s <span class="ital">Heroes of Hebrew History</span>, p. 219.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Samuel also said.</span> Better literally, "And Samuel said." There is no note of time, but probably a considerable interval elapsed before this second trial of Saul was made. God does not finally reject a man until, after repeated opportunities for repentance, he finally proves obdurate. David committed worse crimes than Saul, but he had a tender conscience, and each fall was followed by deep and earnest sorrow. Saul sinned and repented not. Just, then, as Eli had a first warning, which, though apparently unconditional in its terms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>), was really a call to repentance, and was only made irrevocable by his persistence for many years in the same sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11-14</a>), so was it with Saul. The prophet's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13, 14</a> were a stern warning, and had Saul taken them to heart, God would have forgiven him his sin. He repented not, but repeated the offence, and so the sentence was confirmed. When, then, critics say that we have two accounts of Saul's rejection, and that he is represented as having been set aside first for one reason and then for another, their objection arises entirely from a false view of God's dealings with mankind. Alike promises and threatenings, blessings and punishments are conditional; for there is no heathen fatalism in Holy Scripture, but mercy waiting to triumph over justice. God, then, was not willing lightly to cast away so noble an instrument as Saul. His first sin too had been committed when he was new in the kingdom, and in a position of danger and difficulty. He waits, therefore, till Saul has had some years of success and power, and his character has developed itself, and is taking its permanent form; and then again gives him a trial in order to test his fitness to be a theocratic king. The interest, then, of this chapter lies in the unfolding of Saul's character, and so it follows immediately upon ch. 14, which was occupied with the same subject, without any note of chronology, because the historical narrative is subservient to the personal. Hence, too, Samuel's solemn address, reminding Saul that he was Jehovah's anointed one, and therefore had special duties towards him; that he had also been anointed by Samuel's instrumentality, and after earnest instruction as to his duties; and, finally, that Israel was Jehovah's people, and their king, therefore, bound to obey Jehovah's commands. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>General Summary of Saul's other Wars, and Account of his Family. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>. "But Saul had taken the sovereignty." As Saul had first of all secured a recognition of himself as king on the part of all the tribes of Israel, through his victory over the Ammonites at Jabesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-12.htm">1 Samuel 11:12</a>.), so it was through the victory which he had gained over the Philistines, and by which these obstinate foes of Israel were driven back into their own land, that he first acquired the kingship over Israel, i.e., first really secured the regal authority over the Israelites. This is the meaning of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;; and this statement is not at variance either with the election of Saul by lot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17</a>.), or with his confirmation at Gilgal (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14-15</a>). But as Saul had to fight for the sovereignty, and could only secure it by successful warfare, his other wars are placed in the foreground in the summary account of his reign which follows (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>), whilst the notices concerning his family, which stand at the very beginning in the case of other kings, are not mentioned till afterwards (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm">1 Samuel 14:49-51</a>). Saul fought successfully against all the enemies of Israel round about; against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, a district of Syria on this side the Euphrates (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>), and against the Philistines. The war against the Ammonites is described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-15</a>; but with the Philistines Saul had to wage repeated war all the days of his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>). The other wars are none of them more fully described, simply because they were of no importance to the history of the kingdom of God, having neither furnished occasion for any miraculous displays of divine omnipotence, nor brought about the subjection of hostile nations to the power of Israel. "Whithersoever he turned, he inflicted punishment." This is the rendering which Luther has very aptly given to &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;; for &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; signifies to declare wrong, hence to condemn, more especially as applied to judges: here it denotes sentence or condemnation by deeds. Saul chastised these nations for their attacks upon Israel.</body></html>
