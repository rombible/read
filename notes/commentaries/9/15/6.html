This kindly feeling sprang up soon after the departure from Egypt, and was, no doubt, in the first instance owing to the fact of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, belonging to this people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm" title="And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.

We are sure that the righteous Lord does no injustice to any. The remembering the kindness of the ancestors of the Kenites, in favour to them, at the time God was punishing the injuries done by the ancestors of the Amalekites, tended to clear the righteousness of God in this dispensation. It is dangerous to be found in the company of God's enemies, and it is our duty and interest to come out from among them, lest we share in their sins and plagues, Re 18:4. As the commandment had been express, and a test of Saul's obedience, his conduct evidently was the effect of a proud, rebellious spirit. He destroyed only the refuse, that was good for little. That which was now destroyed was sacrificed to the justice of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Telaim - Probably the same as "Telem" <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-24.htm">Joshua 15:24</a>, one of the uttermost cities of Judah, toward the coast of Edom.

In Abraham's time they were a powerful people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>), but, for some reason or other, broke up into small tribes, some, as those here spoken of, choosing the wilderness of Judah for their home (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), others living far to the north in Naphtali (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11, 17</a>), others among the rocks of Arabia Petraea.

If we observe this, which is the true relation between the two clauses in this verse, the appearance of abruptness which we find in the first notice completely vanishes, and the verse follows very suitably upon the allusion to the general. The meaning might be expressed in this manner: And as Saul had to carry on a severe war against the Philistines his whole life long, he drew to himself every powerful man and every brave man that he met with. </body></html>
