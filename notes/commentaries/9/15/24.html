The grounds of the Divine rejection evidently sank deep into Saul’s heart. Such a thought as that, in the eyes of the Invisible and Eternal, he ranked with the idolators and heathen sinners around, was, even for one sunk so low as Saul, terrible.<p><span class= "bld">Because I feared the people.</span>—He, with stammering lips, while deprecating the Divine sentence, still seeks to justify himself; but all that he could allege in excuse only more plainly marked out his unfitness for his high post. He could, after all, only plead that he loved the praise of men more than the approval of his God; that he preferred—as so many of earth’s great ones have since done—the sweets of transient popular applause to the solitary consciousness that he was a faithful servant of the Highest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/15-24.htm" title="And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice....">1 Samuel 15:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">I have sinned — </span>It does by no means appear that Saul acts the hypocrite herein, in assigning a false cause of his disobedience.

All his care was to save his credit, and preserve his interest in the people. Men are fickle and alter their minds, feeble and cannot effect their purposes; something happens they could not foresee, by which their measures are broken; but with God it is not so.

I have sinned &#8230; turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord&#8212;The erring, but proud and obstinate monarch was now humbled. He was conscience-smitten for the moment, but his confession proceeded not from sincere repentance, but from a sense of danger and desire of averting the sentence denounced against him. For the sake of public appearance, he besought Samuel not to allow their serious differences to transpire, but to join with him in a public act of worship. Under the influence of his painfully agitated feelings, he designed to offer sacrifice, partly to express his gratitude for the recent victory, and partly to implore mercy and a reversal of his doom. It was, from another angle, a politic scheme, that Samuel might be betrayed into a countenancing of his design in reserving the cattle for sacrificing. Samuel declined to accompany him.<p>I feared the people, and obeyed their voice&#8212;This was a different reason from the former he had assigned. It was the language of a man driven to extremities, and even had it been true, the principles expounded by Samuel showed that it could have been no extenuation of the offense. The prophet then pronounced the irreversible sentence of the rejection of Saul and his family. He was judicially cut off for his disobedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have sinned; </span> which confession proceeded not from true repentance, but from the sense of his great danger, and from a desire of recalling that dreadful sentence denounced against him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The commandment of the Lord, and thy words, </span> i.e. the commandment of the Lord delivered to me by thy words; another <span class="ital">hendiadis</span>.

The rejection of Saul<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">I have sinned</span>] Though a formal confession of his sin is extorted from Saul, he does not humble himself before God in genuine penitence. He still tries to shift the blame on to the people, and his chief anxiety is lest the breach between Samuel and himself should become a public scandal and weaken his authority (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-30.htm" title="Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.">1 Samuel 15:30</a></span>).

The same authority which had first given him the kingdom now withdraws it from him, and pronounces his offence as equal in God's sight to crimes which Saul himself held in great abhorrence. He humbles himself, therefore, before Samuel, acknowledges his sin, and frankly confesses that the cause of it had been his unwillingness to act in a manner contrary to the wishes of the people; and we must fairly conclude that the sparing of the spoil had been the people's doing. But was it not the king's duty to make the people obedient to Jehovah's voice? As the theocratic king, he was Jehovah's minister, and in preferring popularity to duty he showed himself unworthy of his position. Nor can we suppose that his confession of sin arose from penitence. It was the result simply of vexation at having his victory crossed by reproaches and disapproval from the only power capable of holding him in check. It seems, too, as if it were Samuel whom he feared more than Jehovah; for he speaks of <span class="cmt_word">thy words,</span> and asks Samuel to pardon his sin, and to grant him the favour of his public presence with him at the sacrifice which was about to be celebrated in honour of their triumph. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samuel therefore bade him be silent. &#1492;&#1512;&#1507;, "leave off," excusing thyself any further. "I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night." (The Chethibh &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is evidently a copyist's error for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;.) "Is it not true, when thou wast little in thine eyes (a reference to Saul's own words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), thou didst become head of the tribes of Israel? and Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel, and Jehovah sent thee on the way, and said, Go and ban the sinners, the Amalekites, and make war against them, until thou exterminatest them. And wherefore hast thou nor hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and hast fallen upon the booty," etc.? (&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>.)<p>Even after this Saul wanted to justify himself, and to throw the blame of sparing the cattle upon the people. </body></html>
