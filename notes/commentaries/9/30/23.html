Ewald prefers to render the phrase as an ejaculatory oath, “By that which the Lord,” &c. Some commentators here quote a passage from Polybius, where a similar scene is depicted as having taken place after the capture of Nova Carthago, where Publius Scipio decided that the spoil then taken should be divided equally among the troops that had been actually engaged, and the reserves and the sick among the soldiery, and those in the army who had been detached from the main body on special service.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/30-23.htm" title="Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which the LORD has given us, who has preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand....">1 Samuel 30:23-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye shall not do so, my brethren — </span>He uses his authority to overrule their intention; but manages the matter with all sweetness, though they were such wicked and unreasonable men, calling them brethren; not only as being of the same nation and religion with him, but as his fellow- soldiers. <span class="ital">With that which the Lord hath given us — </span>As much as to say, When God hath been so good to us, we ought not to be unkind to our brethren, nor what he hath freely imparted, ought we churlishly and injuriously to withhold from them. <span class="ital">For who will hearken unto you? — </span>No disinterested person, he tells them, would be of their opinion, if the matter were referred to them. <span class="ital">They shall part alike — </span>A prudent and equitable constitution, and therefore practised by the Romans, as Polybius and others note. The reason of it is manifest; because they were exposed to hazards as well as their brethren; and were a reserve to whom they might retreat in case of a defeat; and they were now in actual service, and in the station in which their general had placed them. <span class="ital">And it was so from that day forward</span> — This law, concerning the division of the spoil taken from an enemy, seems to have continued to the time of the Maccabees, as appears from the second book of their history, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/8-28.htm" title="And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they divided among themselves and their servants.">2Ma 8:28</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/8-30.htm" title="Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easily got high and strong holds, and divided among themselves many spoils more, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also, equal in spoils with themselves.">2Ma 8:30</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:21-31 What God gives us, he designs we should do good with. In distributing the spoil, David was just and kind. Those are men of Belial indeed, who delight in putting hardships upon their brethren, and care not who is starved, so that they may be fed to the full. David was generous and kind to all his friends. Those who consider the Lord as the Giver of their abundance, will dispose of it with fairness and liberality.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is, "and David took all the sheep and oxen which the Amalekites drove" (i. e. had in their possession) "before that acquisition of cattle" (namely, before what they took in their raid to the south), "and they" (the people) "said, This is David's spoil." This was his share as captain of the band (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24-26</a>). All the other plunder of the camp - arms, ornaments, jewels, money, clothes, camels, accoutrements, and so on - was divided among the little army. David's motive in choosing the sheep and oxen for himself was to make presents to his friends in Judah <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26-31</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow&#8212;This unexpected accession of spoil was nearly proving an occasion of quarrel through the selfish cupidity of some of his followers, and serious consequences might have ensued had they not been prevented by the prudence of the leader, who enacted it as a standing ordinance&#8212;the equitable rule&#8212;that all the soldiers should share alike (see Nu 31:11; see on [254]Nu 31:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye shall not do so, my brethren:</span> he useth his power and authority to overrule them; but manageth it with all sweetness, calling them brethren; not only as of the same nation and religion with him, but as his fellow soldiers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With that which the Lord hath given us; </span> what he hath freely imparted to us, we should not unkindly and injuriously withhold from our brethren. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said David, ye shall not do so, my brethren,.... Though he saw through their wickedness, and disapproved of the bad sentiments they had embraced, yet he deals gently with them, calling them brethren, being of the same nation and religion, and his fellow soldiers; yet at the same time keeps up and maintains his dignity and authority as a general, and declares it should not be as they willed, and gives his reasons for it, that it was not fit they should do as they pleased: <p>with that which the Lord hath given us; what they had was given them, and therefore, as they had freely received, they should freely give; and what was given them, was not given to them only, but to the whole body, by the Lord: <p>who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand; it was not by their own power and might that they got the victory over the enemy, and the spoil into their hands, but it was through the Lord only; and therefore, as they should not assume the honour of the victory to themselves, so neither should they claim the spoil as wholly belonging to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not do so, my brethren.</span> David rejects their unjust proposal kindly, but firmly. <span class="cmt_word">With that which</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of that which, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Who will</span>  <span class="cmt_word">hearken unto you in this matter?</span> Literally, "this word," this proposal of yours. David then enacts that those left to guard the baggage are to share in the booty equally with the combatants.
