In distributing the spoil, David was just and kind. Those are men of Belial indeed, who delight in putting hardships upon their brethren, and care not who is starved, so that they may be fed to the full. David was generous and kind to all his friends. Those who consider the Lord as the Giver of their abundance, will dispose of it with fairness and liberality.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aroer - Not Aroer on the Arnon, but (if rightly written) some town in Judah, not elsewhere named.<p>Siphmoth, Rachal <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>, and Athach <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-30.htm">1 Samuel 30:30</a>, are unknown and not elsewhere mentioned; but Zabdi the Shiphmite <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-27.htm">1 Chronicles 27:27</a>, who was over David's wine-cellars, was evidently a native of the first-named place. It is a remarkable proof of the grateful nature of David, and of his fidelity to his early friendships, as well as a curious instance of undesigned coincidence, that we find among those employed by David in offices of trust in the height of his power so many inhabitants of those obscure places where he found friends in the days of his early difficulties. Ezri the son of Chelub, Shimei the Ramathite, and Zabdi the Shiphmite, as well as Ira and Gareb, and Ittai, and Hezrai, and many others, were probably among these friends of his youth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah&#8212;This was intended as an acknowledgment to the leading men in those towns and villages of Judah which had ministered to his necessities in the course of his various wanderings. It was the dictate of an amiable and grateful heart; and the effect of this well-timed liberality was to bring a large accession of numbers to his camp (1Ch 12:22). The enumeration of these places shows what a numerous and influential party of adherents to his cause he could count within his own tribe [1Sa 30:27-31].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And to them which were in Rachal,....
