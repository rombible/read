South Ramoth . . . Yattir.</span>—Here follows an enumeration of the cities of Judah to whom David sent, most of which have been identified. Bethel—evidently not the well known place of that name, but Bethuel or Bethul in the tribe of Simeon. The LXX. read here Baithsour. South Ramoth, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Ramah of the South. Shimei, who was over David’s vineyards, was most likely a native of this town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-27.htm" title="And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:">1Chronicles 27:27</a>). The place has not been identified. Yattir—the present <span class= "ital">Attir </span>in the southern part of Judah.

In distributing the spoil, David was just and kind. Those are men of Belial indeed, who delight in putting hardships upon their brethren, and care not who is starved, so that they may be fed to the full. David was generous and kind to all his friends. Those who consider the Lord as the Giver of their abundance, will dispose of it with fairness and liberality.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bethel - i. e.

It was the dictate of an amiable and grateful heart; and the effect of this well-timed liberality was to bring a large accession of numbers to his camp (1Ch 12:22).
