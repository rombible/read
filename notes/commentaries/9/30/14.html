Taking advantage of the war between Israel and Philistia, and of the northerly march of the troops of both countries, Amalek made a swift and sudden descent upon the south country. The Cherethites were a Philistine people dwelling in the south, and along the sea-coast.·Some have supposed that the name “Crēthites” which represents the Hebrew more accurately—came originally, as the name seems to indicate, from the island of Crete. Capthor, the home of the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a>), not improbably is identical with Crete. The whole question of the history of this singular Philistine people, who were certainly not indigenous to Canaan, but who were settlers in it at a comparatively recent date, and who gave their name “Palestine<span class= "ital">” </span>to the whole land, is most obscure.<p>Before the arrival of Israel in Canaan the Philistines held a very strong position on the southern coast, and not long before Samson’s time they had been strengthened by fresh arrivals from Crete and other western regions, and from this date rapidly gained power and influence, and at more than one period disputed the supremacy with the Hebrew race, whom they threatened to supplant altogether.<p>We hear subsequently of the Cherethites mentioned in the passage under the command of Benaiah, as a portion of King David’s body-guard. This troop or regiment of Philistines was first, no doubt, enrolled during his residence at Ziklag. He retained this body of foreigners, of course continually recruited, about his person all through his reign. Such a body-guard, made up of foreigners, has always been a favourite practice among sovereigns. The Scottish archers and the corps of Swiss Guards, at different periods of the French monarchy, and, on a larger scale, the Varangian guard of the Greek emperors of Constantinople in the tenth century, are good examples of this preference for foreigners in the case of the body-guards of the sovereign.<p><span class= "bld">And upon the coast which belongeth to Judah.</span>—The eastern portion of the Negeb or south country, reaching from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea.<p><span class= "bld">And upon the south of Caleb.</span>—One district of the Negeb or south country was given to Caleb, the companion of Joshua, as a reward for his faith and his courage. His portion, which was called Caleb after the famous chieftain, included all the country and villages round about Hebron, which became subsequently a city of the priests.<p><span class= "bld">And we burned Ziklag with fire.</span>—This act, which closed the reign of Amalek, was intended as a piece of stern revenge for the late incursion of David into their country, and for the cruelties practised on the captives.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm" title="We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.">1 Samuel 30:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Upon the south of the Cherethites — </span>That is, <span class="ital">of the Philistines; </span>for it is explained, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-16.htm" title="And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad on all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.">1 Samuel 30:16</a>, to have been <span class="ital">the land of the Philistines. </span>Hence it appears that the Amalekites were enemies to the Philistines. So that David did not act against the interests of his benefactor, Achish, in making incursions upon those people. <span class="ital">And upon the south of Caleb — </span>We read nowhere else of this land; but, in all probability, it was that south part of Judah which was given to Caleb, and which his posterity inherited, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-13.htm" title="And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.">Joshua 14:13</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:7-15 If in all our ways, even when, as in this case, there can be no doubt they are just, we acknowledge God, we may expect that he will direct our steps, as he did those of David. David, in tenderness to his men, would by no means urge them beyond their strength. The Son of David thus considers the frames of his followers, who are not all alike strong and vigorous in their spiritual pursuits and conflicts; but, where we are weak, there he is kind; nay more, there he is strong, 2Co 12:9,10. A poor Egyptian lad, scarcely alive, is made the means of a great deal of good to David. Justly did Providence make this poor servant, who was basely used by his master, an instrument in the destruction of the Amalekites; for God hears the cry of the oppressed. Those are unworthy the name of true Israelites, who shut up their compassion from persons in distress. We should neither do an injury nor deny a kindness to any man; some time or other it may be in the power of the lowest to return a kindness or an injury.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Cherethites - Here used as synonymous with Philistines <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-16.htm">1 Samuel 30:16</a>. In David's reign the body-guard commanded by Benaiah consisted of Cherethites and Pelethites (Philistines?) and a picked corps of six hundred men of Gath commanded by Ittai the Gittite. It would seem from this that the Cherethites and Philistines were two kindred and associated tribes, like Angles and Saxons, who took possession of the seacoast of Palestine. The Philistines, being the more powerful, gave their name to the country and the nation in general, though that of the Cherethites was not wholly extinguished. Many persons connect the name Cherethite with that of the island of Crete. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. the Cherethites&#8212;that is, the Philistines (Eze 25:16; Zep 2:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Cherethites, </span> i.e. the Philistines, as is manifest from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-16.htm" title="And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad on all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.">1 Samuel 30:16</a></span>, who are so called <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm" title="Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy you, that there shall be no inhabitant.">Zephaniah 2:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb:</span> this is added by way of explication: q.d. that part of the south of Judah which belongs to Caleb’s posterity, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-13.htm" title="And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.">Joshua 14:13</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites,....

We here find the Cherethim inhabiting the southern portion of the land of the Philistines, and such was still the case in the days of Zephaniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>). As David retained Ziklag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>), he appears to have chosen the men who were to guard his person from this neighbourhood, having probably been struck by their stature and martial bearing when dwelling among them. Hence it is probable that the Pelethim were also a Philistine race. Whether the Cherethim and the Philistines generally came from Crete to Palestine is a very disputed question, but they were certainly not indigenous, but immigrants into Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">Caleb</span>. Upon the settlement of the Israelites in Canaan, Hebron with a large district in the south of Judah was assigned to Caleb the Kenezite, who with his clan had been incorporated into the tribe of Judah. Though the town was afterwards assigned to the priests, the whole country round remained subject to Caleb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-11.htm">Joshua 21:11, 12</a>), and continued to bear his name. Evidently the Amalekites, beginning on the east, had swept the whole southern district of Judah before entering the country of the Philistines, where they no doubt burnt Ziklag in revenge for David's cruel treatment of them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David was greatly distressed in consequence; "for the people thought ('said,' sc., in their hearts) to stone him," because they sought the occasion of their calamity in his connection with Achish, with which many of his adherents may very probably have been dissatisfied. "For the soul of the whole people was embittered (i.e., all the people were embittered in their souls) because of their sons and daughters," who had been carried away into slavery. "But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God," i.e., sought consolation and strength in prayer and believing confidence in the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>.). This strength he manifested in the resolution to follow the foes and rescue their booty from them. To this end he had the ephod brought by the high priest Abiathar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>), and inquired by means of the Urim of the Lord, "Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake it?" These questions were answered in the affirmative; and the promise was added, "and thou wilt rescue." So David pursued the enemy with his six hundred men as far as the brook Besor, where the rest, i.e., two hundred, remained standing (stayed behind). The words &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which are appended in the form of a circumstantial clause, are to be connected, so far as the facts are concerned, with what follows: whilst the others remained behind, David pursued the enemy still farther with four hundred men. By the word &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the historian has somewhat anticipated the matter, and therefore regards it as necessary to define the expression still further in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-10.htm">1 Samuel 30:10</a>. We are precluded from changing the text, as Thenius suggests, by the circumstance that all the early translators read it in this manner, and have endeavoured to make the expression intelligible by paraphrasing it. These two hundred men were too tired to cross the brook and go any farther. (&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;, which only occurs here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-21.htm">1 Samuel 30:21</a>, signifies, in Syriac, to be weary or exhausted.) As Ziklag was burnt down, of course they found no provisions there, and were consequently obliged to set out in pursuit of the foe without being able to provide themselves with the necessary supplies. The brook Besor is supposed to be the Wady Sheriah, which enters the sea below Ashkelon (see v. Raumer, Pal. p. 52). </body></html>
