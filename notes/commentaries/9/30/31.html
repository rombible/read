It is now called El-Khalil (“friend of God”), owing to Abraham’s residence there. During the early years of David’s rule, which followed the death of Saul, Hebron was the residence and royal city of David. Beneath the building of the present Mosque of Hebron is the famous Cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah and the patriarchs Isaac and Jacob, and his wife Leah, are buried.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:21-31 What God gives us, he designs we should do good with. In distributing the spoil, David was just and kind. Those are men of Belial indeed, who delight in putting hardships upon their brethren, and care not who is starved, so that they may be fed to the full. David was generous and kind to all his friends. Those who consider the Lord as the Giver of their abundance, will dispose of it with fairness and liberality.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hebron - Now El-Khulil (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>). Hebron was a city of refuge <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>, and one of the cities of the Kohathites <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-11.htm">Joshua 21:11</a>.

It was the dictate of an amiable and grateful heart; and the effect of this well-timed liberality was to bring a large accession of numbers to his camp (1Ch 12:22). The enumeration of these places shows what a numerous and influential party of adherents to his cause he could count within his own tribe [1Sa 30:27-31].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">to go</span>; whither they used to resort in the time of Saul’s persecution, either to hide themselves in some of their territories, or to get provision from thence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And to them which were in Hebron,....

It was soon to attain greater importance as the capital of David’s kingdom during the first seven years and a half of his reign. It lies 20 miles south of Jerusalem, picturesquely situated in a narrow valley surrounded by rocky hills, whose sides are clothed with luxuriant vineyards. Its modern name is <span class="ital">El Khulîl</span> = “The Friend,” in memory of Abraham who was called “the friend of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm" title="Are not you our God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham your friend for ever?">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm" title="For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.">James 2:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the places</span>, &c.] It is evident that David’s outlaw life must have lasted for some considerable time, and have proved an important factor in preparing the men of Judah to welcome him as their king. The instances quoted above indicate that it was during this period that he gained many of the faithful friends who afterwards filled offices of trust in his kingdom.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hebron</span>, destined soon to become David's capital (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>), lay about fourteen miles south of Jerusalem.

Such were Ira and Gareb, Ithrites from Jattir, Shama and Jehiel from Aroer; perhaps also Zabdi the Shiphmite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-27.htm">1 Chronicles 27:27</a>) came from Siphmoth. We find David in this narrative acting justly as a soldier, generously to those who had been kind to him in his wanderings, and forming friendships which he retained and cherished long afterwards, when from being a fugitive he had become a king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>So was it from that day and forward; and he (David) made it (this regulation as to the booty) "the law and right for Israel unto this day."</body></html>
