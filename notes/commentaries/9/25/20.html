Her behaviour was very submissive. Yielding pacifies great offences. She puts herself in the place of a penitent, and of a petitioner. She could not excuse her husband's conduct. She depends not upon her own reasonings, but on God's grace, to soften David, and expects that grace would work powerfully. She says that it was below him to take vengeance on so weak and despicable an enemy as Nabal, who, as he would do him no kindness, so he could do him no hurt. She foretells the glorious end of David's present troubles. God will preserve thy life; therefore it becomes not thee unjustly and unnecessarily to take away the lives of any, especially of the people of thy God and Saviour. Abigail keeps this argument for the last, as very powerful with so good a man; that the less he indulged his passion, the more he consulted his peace and the repose of his own conscience. Many have done that in a heat, which they have a thousand times wished undone again. The sweetness of revenge is soon turned into bitterness. When tempted to sin, we should consider how it will appear when we think upon it afterwards.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The covert of the hill - Probably a defile or glen, literally a "secret place," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-2.htm">1 Samuel 19:2</a>. She was riding down into this glen from one side, while David and his men were descending the opposite hill. It is perhaps mentioned that she came by this "secret place," because she chose this path to escape the observation of her husband or of anyone else. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you&#8212;People in the East always try to produce an effect by their presents, loading on several beasts what might be easily carried by one, and bringing them forward, article by article, in succession.

But the Lord preserved him from this sin by the fact that, just at the right time, Abigail, the intelligent and pious wife of Nabal, heard of the affair, and was able to appease the wrath of David by her immediate and kindly interposition.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-14.htm">1 Samuel 25:14-16</a><p>Abigail heard from one of (Nabal's) servants what had taken place (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, to wish any one prosperity and health, i.e., to salute, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-10.htm">1 Samuel 13:10</a>; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;, from &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, to speak wrathfully: on the form, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-19.htm">1 Samuel 15:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>), and also what had been praiseworthy in the behaviour of David's men towards Nabal's shepherds; how they had not only done them no injury, had not robbed them of anything, but had defended them all the while. "They were a wall (i.e., a firm protection) round us by night and by day, as long as we were with them feeding the sheep," i.e., a wall of defence against attacks from the Bedouins living in the desert.</body></html>
