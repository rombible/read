She was thinking, perhaps, of the young captain then standing before her in all the pride of his early reputation, as the future hero-king of Israel, sitting on the throne of the insane and gloomy man—her evil husband’s friend—King Saul, and it may be of his son reigning after him; but the unconscious prophetess, we may be sure, never dreamed of that glorious and holy One in whose person, far down the stream of ages, the Eternal would make good her words, and indeed found for that outlawed chieftain, before whom she was then kneeling, a sure house.<p><span class= "bld">The battles of the Lord.</span>—Abigail, in common with the pious Israelites of her time, looked on the wars waged by the armies of Israel against the idolatrous tribes and nations around them as the wars of Jehovah. We frequently in these early records meet with the expressions, “fighting the battle of the Lord,” “the ranks of the living God,” “the battle is the Lord’s.” We hear, too, of an ancient collection of songs—ballads, perhaps, would be a more accurate designation—now lost, entitled “The Book of the Wars of the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-14.htm" title="Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,">Numbers 21:14</a>). For several years now since his famous combat with the great champion of idolatry, Goliath, David had been the popular hero and the favourite subject of those folk-songs which ever loved to sing of these “Wars of Jehovah.”<p><span class= "bld">Evil hath not been found in thee.</span>—<span class= "ital">Rauh, </span>“evil,” here signifies not “wickedness,” but “misfortune.” The wife of Nabal means to say that all through that stormy, restless life of David’s, the Lord had ever held him up. It had given him victory and crowned his efforts with splendid success; and in the later days of bitter persecution, the same invisible One had shielded him, and had turned what seemed to be the certain ruin of his prospects into a still more certain career of usefulness and popularity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-28.htm" title="I pray you, forgive the trespass of your handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil has not been found in you all your days.">1 Samuel 25:28</a></span>. <span class="ital">Forgive the trespass of thy handmaid </span>— That is, the trespass which I have taken upon myself, and which, if it be punished, the punishment will reach to me. <span class="ital">Sure house — </span>Will give the kingdom to thee, and to thy house for ever, as he hath promised thee.

Her behaviour was very submissive. Yielding pacifies great offences. She puts herself in the place of a penitent, and of a petitioner. She could not excuse her husband's conduct. She depends not upon her own reasonings, but on God's grace, to soften David, and expects that grace would work powerfully. She says that it was below him to take vengeance on so weak and despicable an enemy as Nabal, who, as he would do him no kindness, so he could do him no hurt. She foretells the glorious end of David's present troubles. God will preserve thy life; therefore it becomes not thee unjustly and unnecessarily to take away the lives of any, especially of the people of thy God and Saviour. Abigail keeps this argument for the last, as very powerful with so good a man; that the less he indulged his passion, the more he consulted his peace and the repose of his own conscience. Many have done that in a heat, which they have a thousand times wished undone again. The sweetness of revenge is soon turned into bitterness. When tempted to sin, we should consider how it will appear when we think upon it afterwards.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Lord will make ... a sure house - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-38.htm">1 Kings 11:38</a>.

Her conviction rests (1) on the fact that he has proved himself the champion of Jehovah’s people (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm" title="And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.">1 Samuel 18:17</a>); (2) on his blameless life. Doubtless the nation was already anxiously looking forward to David as its future king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">will certainly make my lord a sure house</span>] Will establish him and his posterity on the throne. For the phrase see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-35.htm" title="And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.">1 Samuel 2:35</a>; and compare the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. The same epithet is applied to David himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-14.htm" title="Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house?">1 Samuel 22:14</a> (E.

David’s generous and winning character was in sharp contrast to Saul’s jealous suspicion and mad cruelty.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forgive the trespass of thine handmaid.</span> Reverting to her words in ver. 24, that the blame and punishment must rest on her, she now prays for forgiveness; but the intermediate words in ver. 26, emphasised in ver. 31, have raised her request to a higher level. Her prayer rests on the ground that she was saving David from a sin, and that in his thirst for vengeance he was bringing upon himself guilt. If the form of Abigail's address was most humble, the matter of it was brave and noble. <span class="cmt_word">A sure house.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> permanent  prosperity (see on 1 Samuel 2:35). <span class="cmt_word">Because my lord fighteth.</span> Hebrew, "will fight." David was not fighting these battles now because he was not yet enthroned as the theocratic king. It was Saul's business at present to fight "Jehovah's battles," either in person or by his officers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>). The words, therefore, distinctly look forward to the time when David as king will have the duty imposed upon him of protecting Jehovah's covenant people. <span class="cmt_word">Evil hath not been found in thee.</span> Hebrew, "shall not be found in thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when the time comes for thee to take the kingdom no one shall be able to allege against thee any offence by which thou hast lost thy title to the kingly office; nor afterwards as king shalt thou be guilty of any breach of thy duty to Jehovah, Israel's supreme Ruler, so as to incur rejection as Saul has done. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-21.htm">1 Samuel 25:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-22.htm">1 Samuel 25:22</a> contain a circumstantial clause introduced parenthetically to explain what follows: but David had said, Only for deception (i.e., for no other purpose than to be deceived in my expectation) have I defended all that belongs to this man (Nabal) in the desert, so that nothing of his was missed, and (for) he hath repaid me evil for good. God do so to the enemies of David, if I leave, etc.; i.e., "as truly as God will punish the enemies of David, so certainly will I not leave till the morning light, of all that belongeth to him, one that pisseth against the wall." This oath, in which the punishment of God is not called down upon the swearer himself (God do so to me), as it generally is, but upon the enemies of David, is analogous to that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>, where punishment is threatened upon the person addressed, who is there made to swear; except that here, as the oath could not be uttered in the ears of the person addressed, upon whom it was to fall, the enemies generally are mentioned instead of "to thee." There is no doubt, therefore, as to the correctness of the text. The substance of this imprecation may be explained from the fact that David is so full of the consciousness of fighting and suffering for the cause of the kingdom of God, that he discerns in the insult heaped upon him by Nabal an act of hostility to the Lord and the cause of His kingdom. The phrase &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, mingens in parietem, is only met with in passages which speak of the destruction of a family or household to the very last man (viz., besides this passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-11.htm">1 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8</a>), and neither refers primarily to dogs, as Ephraem Syrus, Juda ben Karish, and others maintain; nor to the lowest class of men, as Winer, Maurer, and others imagine; nor to little boys, as L. de Dieu, Gesenius, etc., suppose; but, as we may see from the explanatory clause appended to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8</a>, to every male (quemcumque masculi generis hominem: vid., Bochart, Hieroz. i. pp. 776ff., and Rdiger on Ges.
