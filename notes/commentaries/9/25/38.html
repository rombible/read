Although the death was a sequel to the selfishness, the passion, and the intemperance, it does not appear that anything more than the operation of natural causes occasioned the end here. In the language of these old divinely inspired writers, disease and sickness are often spoken of as the special “shafts” aimed by the Most High, as in fact they are.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:32-39 David gives God thanks for sending him this happy check in a sinful way. Whoever meet us with counsel, direction, comfort, caution, or seasonable reproof, we must see God sending them. We ought to be very thankful for those happy providences which are the means of keeping us from sinning. Most people think it enough, if they take reproof patiently; but few will take it thankfully, and commend those who give it, and accept it as a favour. The nearer we are to committing sin, the greater is the mercy of a seasonable restraint. Sinners are often most secure when most in danger. He was very drunk. A sign he was Nabal, a fool, that could not use plenty without abusing it; who could not be pleasant with his friends without making a beast of himself. There is not a surer sign that a man has but little wisdom, nor a surer way to destroy the little he has, than drinking to excess. Next morning, how he is changed! His heart overnight merry with wine, next morning heavy as a stone; so deceitful are carnal pleasures, so soon passes the laughter of the fool; the end of that mirth is heaviness. Drunkards are sad, when they reflect upon their own folly. About ten days after, the Lord smote Nabal, that he died. David blessed God that he had been kept from killing Nabal. Worldly sorrow, mortified pride, and an affrighted conscience, sometimes end the joys of the sensualist, and separate the covetous man from his wealth; but, whatever the weapon, the Lord smites men with death when it pleases him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He became as a stone - Probably his violent anger at hearing it brought on a fit of apoplexy to which he was disposed by the drunken revel of the night before.

In his reply he praised the Lord for having sent Abigail to meet him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-32.htm">1 Samuel 25:32</a>), and then congratulated Abigail upon her understanding and her actions, that she had kept him from bloodshed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-33.htm">1 Samuel 25:33</a>); otherwise he would certainly have carried out the revenge which he had resolved to take upon Nabal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-34.htm">1 Samuel 25:34</a>). &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; is strongly adversative: nevertheless. &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506;, inf. constr.

The very unusual form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, an imperfect with the termination of the perfect, might indeed possibly be a copyist's error for &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497; (Olsh.
