Not improbably the old man, too, well aware of the character of his own sons, hoped to train up the favoured child—whose connection with himself and the sanctuary had begun in so remarkable a manner—as his successor in the chief sacred and civil office in Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-19.htm" title="Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.">1 Samuel 2:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">His mother made him a little coat — </span>The ephod, being used only in the service of God, was no doubt provided at the public expense.

As he did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break through restraints.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A little coat - The robe of the ephod was also one of the garments worn by the High Priest (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31</a> note). This pointed mention of the ephod and the robe as worn by the youthful Samuel, seems to point to an extraordinary and irregular priesthood to which he was called by God in an age when the provisions of the Levitical law were not yet in full operation, and in which there was no impropriety in the eyes of his contemporaries, seeing that nonconformity to the whole Law was the rule rather than the exception throughout the days of the Judges. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year&#8212;Aware that he could not yet render any useful service to the tabernacle, she undertook the expense of supplying him with wearing apparel.

It was an under garment of wool, woven throughout without seam, with holes for the head and arms, and reaching nearly to the ground: when used by women it had sleeves (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). Under it they had a tunic or shirt fitting so closely that a man simply so clad was considered naked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), and over it priests and Levites wore the ephod, and so also David on the occasion mentioned above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm">1 Chronicles 15:27</a>). The <span class="accented">meil</span> seems, moreover, to have often been a handsome dress, as that of the priests was of purple blue, with embroidery of pomegranates in three colours, and golden bells (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31-34</a>); and when made of delicate materials for the use of the rich, it and the tunic are the soft luxurious clothing spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-8.htm">Matthew 11:8</a>. As the meal was the ordinary dress of all classes of people, it was made for Samuel at home, and can have no special meaning; but the ephod shows that he was brought up in the daffy practice of holy duties. This annual present, however, of clothing made by the mother's hands proves that the dedication of her son to God was not allowed to interfere with home affections, and both parents and child must have looked forward with joy to happy meetings at each recurrence of the family visit to the sanctuary. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the right of the priests towards the people was (the following)."
