As he did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break through restraints.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Law of Moses defined exactly what was to be the priest's portion of every peace offering <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-35</a>, as it also gave express directions about the burning of the fat <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-23.htm">Leviticus 7:23-25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>. It was therefore a gross act of disobedience and lawlessness on the part of Hophni and Phinehas to take more than the Law gave them. Incidental evidence is afforded by this passage to the existence of the Levitical law at this time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-17. the priests' custom with the people&#8212;When persons wished to present a sacrifice of peace offering on the altar, the offering was brought in the first instance to the priest, and as the Lord's part was burnt, the parts appropriated respectively to the priests and offerers were to be sodden. But Eli's sons, unsatisfied with the breast and shoulder, which were the perquisites appointed to them by the divine law (Ex 29:27; Le 7:31, 32), not only claimed part of the offerer's share, but rapaciously seized them previous to the sacred ceremony of heaving or waving (see on [235]Le 7:29); and moreover they committed the additional injustice of taking up with their fork those portions which they preferred, while still raw. Pious people revolted at such rapacious and profane encroachments on the dues of the altar, as well as what should have gone to constitute the family and social feast of the offerer. The truth is, the priests having become haughty and unwilling in many instances to accept invitations to those feasts, presents of meat were sent to them; and this, though done in courtesy at first, being, in course of time, established into a right, gave rise to all the rapacious keenness of Eli's sons.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself; </span> not contented with the breast and shoulder which were allotted them by God, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-27.htm" title="And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:">Exodus 29:27</a>,28 Le 7:31</span>, they took also part of the offerer’s share; and besides, they snatched their part before it was heaved and waved, contrary to <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-34.htm" title="For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.">Leviticus 7:34</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot,....

The use of &#1506;&#1491; as a conjunction, in the sense of "yea" or "in fact," may be explained as an elliptical expression, signifying "it comes to this, that." "Seven children" are mentioned as the full number of the divine blessing in children (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>). "The mother of many children" pines away, because she has lost all her sons, and with them her support in her old age (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>). This comes from the Lord, who kills, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-6.htm">1 Samuel 2:6</a> are figurative. God hurls down into death and the danger of death, and also rescues therefrom (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3-4</a>). The first three clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a> are repeated verbatim in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7-8</a>. Dust and the dunghill are figures used to denote the deepest degradation and ignominy. The antithesis to this is, sitting upon the chair or throne of glory, the seat occupied by noble princes. The Lord does all this, for He is the creator and upholder of the world. The pillars (&#1502;&#1510;&#1511;&#1497;, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;  equals  &#1497;&#1510;&#1511;) of the earth are the Lord's; i.e., they were created or set up by Him, and by Him they are sustained. Now as Jehovah, the God of Israel, the Holy One, governs the world with His almighty power, the righteous have nothing to fear. With this thought the last strophe of the song begins:</body></html>
