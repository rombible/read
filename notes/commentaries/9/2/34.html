Let Eli's example excite parents earnestly to strive against the beginnings of wickedness, and to train up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. In the midst of the sentence against the house of Eli, mercy is promised to Israel. God's work shall never fall to the ground for want of hands to carry it on. Christ is that merciful and faithful High Priest, whom God raised up when the Levitical priesthood was thrown off, who in all things did his Father's mind, and for whom God will build a sure house, build it on a rock, so that hell cannot prevail against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>.

Hophni and Phinehas died fighting valiantly in battle, and then came the sacking of Shiloh, and the slaughter of the ministering priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a>). Upon this followed a long delay. For first Eli's grandson, Ahitub, the son of Phinehas, was high priest, and then his two sons, Ahiah and Ahimelech, and then Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech. It was in Ahimelech's days that the slaughter took place at Nob, from which the house of Ithamar seems never to have fully recovered. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And did I choose him out of all the tribes for a priest to myself." The interrogative particle is not to be repeated before &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, but the construction becomes affirmative with the inf. abs. instead of the perfect. "Him" refers back to "thy father" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27</a>, and signifies Aaron. The expression "for a priest" is still further defined by the clauses which follow: &#1506;&#1500; &#1502; &#1500;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, "to ascend upon mine altar," i.e., to approach my altar of burnt-offering and perform the sacrificial worship; "to kindle incense," i.e., to perform the service in the holy place, the principal feature in which was the daily kindling of the incense, which is mentioned instar omnium; "to wear the ephod before me," i.e., to perform the service in the holy of holies, which the high priest could only enter when wearing the ephod to represent Israel before the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-12.htm">Exodus 28:12</a>). "And have given to thy father's house all the firings of the children of Israel" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). These words are to be understood, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>, as signifying that the Lord had given to the house of Aaron, i.e., to the priesthood, the sacrifices of Jehovah to eat in the place of any inheritance in the land, according to the portions appointed in the sacrificial law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6-7</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>.</body></html>
