Lord, increase our faith! We may blush to think that the word of a Philistine should go further than the word of an Israelite, and that the city of Gath should be a place of refuge for a good man, when the cities of Israel refuse him a safe abode. David gained a comfortable settlement, not only at a distance from Gath, but bordering upon Israel, where he might keep up a correspondence with his own countrymen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ziklag - This was properly one of the cities of Simeon within the tribe of Judah (marginal references), but it had been taken possession of by the Philistines.

This clause seems to be added by the continuator of this history, after the death of Samuel; who might be Gad or Nathan; some say Ezra, and Abarbinel that Jeremiah was the writer of it. <p>(g) Travels, &amp;c. p. 136. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Ziklag</span>] One of the cities In the <span class="ital">Negeb</span> or “South Country,” originally assigned to Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-31.htm" title="And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,">Joshua 15:31</a>), but transferred to Simeon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-5.htm" title="And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,">Joshua 19:5</a>), and either never occupied by them or reconquered by the Philistines.

These words do not contain any "sounding of his own praises" (Thenius), but are merely the testimony of a good conscience before God in the presence of an enemy, who is indeed obliged to confess his wrong-doing, but who no longer feels or acknowledges his need of forgiveness. For even Saul's reply to these words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-25.htm">1 Samuel 26:25</a> ("Blessed art thou, my son David: thou wilt undertake, and also prevail:" &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, lit. to vanquish, i.e., to carry out what one undertakes) does not express any genuine goodwill towards David, but only an acknowledgment, forced upon him by this fresh experience of David's magnanimity, that God was blessing all his undertakings, so that he would prevail. Saul had no more thoughts of any real reconciliation with David. "David went his way, and Saul turned to his place" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-25.htm">Numbers 24:25</a>). Thus they parted, and never saw each other again. There is nothing said about Saul returning to his house, as there was when his life was first spared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-22.htm">1 Samuel 24:22</a>). On the contrary, he does not seem to have given up pursuing David; for, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1-12</a>, David was obliged to take refuge in a foreign land, and carry out what he had described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a> as his greatest calamity. </body></html>
