He went there, no doubt, because, conscious of the change that had passed over him, and aware of his new powers, he felt a desire for solitary communing in the quiet of a holy sanctuary with God, who had come so near him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-13.htm" title="And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.">1 Samuel 10:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">When he had made an end of prophesying — </span>Herein he differed from the prophets who met him, in that he prophesied but for a short time, this not being his office. And when he had done he went up to the high place from which they came down, they probably returning with him, to praise God for these wonderful favours, and to beg counsel and help from him in this high business.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:9-16 The signs Samuel had given Saul, came to pass punctually; he found that God had given him another heart, another disposition of mind. Yet let not an outward show of devotion, and a sudden change for the present, be too much relied on; Saul among the prophets was Saul still. His being anointed was kept private. He leaves it to God to carry on his own work by Samuel, and sits still, to see how the matter will fall.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But who is their father - This is a very obscure phrase. If by "father" be intended the head or leader (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-6.htm">1 Chronicles 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>) of the prophets, the question means: "What kind of leader can they have to admit such a person as Saul into the company?" Some versions read "Who is his father?" in the sense: "Who would have expected Kish to have a son among the prophets?"

For, as Procopius Gazaeus observes, he had not the gift of prophecy always; it did not continue with him, but, like that of the seventy elders in the times of Moses, it was designed to make him respectable among the people, and to be taken notice of as a person that God had honoured with a peculiar gift, that so, when he should be chosen king, they would the more readily receive him: <p>he came to the high place; to return thanks to God for the gift bestowed on him, and for that high honour and dignity he was raised unto, of which he had private knowledge; and to pray God to fit him more and more for government, and to, assist him in it, and help him to discharge his office in a wise and faithful manner. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">he came to the high place</span>] When Saul parted from the company of prophets which he met descending from the high-place, he went up there himself to worship.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He came to the high place.</span> Saul had met the prophets coming down from the Bamah; but the same religious fervor, which had made him take so earnest a part in the prophesyings of the young men, urged him now, after parting from their company, himself to go up to the high place, there to offer his prayers and praises to God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"When these signs are come unto thee (the Kethibh &#1514;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is to be read &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-16.htm">Psalm 45:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-4.htm">Esther 4:4</a>; and the Keri &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; is a needless emendation), do to thee what thy hand findeth, i.e., act according to the circumstances (for this formula, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-33.htm">Judges 9:33</a>); for God will be with thee." The occurrence of the signs mentioned was to assure him of the certainty that God would assist him in all that he undertook as king. The first opportunity for action was afforded him by the Ammonite Nahash, who besieged Jabesh-gilead (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-15</a>). </body></html>
