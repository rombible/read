Samuel used to visit it as judge, and hold his court there annually, no doubt on account of the number of pilgrims who were in the habit of visiting it. These men were evidently on a pilgrimage to the old famous shrine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm" title="Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet you three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:">1 Samuel 10:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt come to the plain — </span>Not that at the foot of mount Tabor, which was far from these parts; but another, belonging to some other place. <span class="ital">Beth-el — </span>Properly so called, which was in Ephraim, where there was a noted high place, famous for Jacob’s vision there, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-19.htm" title="And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.">Genesis 28:19</a>,) and where it is probable they offered sacrifices, in this confused state of things, when the ark was in one place, and the tabernacle in another.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 The sacred anointing, then used, pointed at the great Messiah, or Anointed One, the King of the church, and High Priest of our profession, who was anointed with the oil of the Spirit, not by measure, but without measure, and above all the priests and princes of the Jewish church. For Saul's further satisfaction, Samuel gives him some signs which should come to pass the same day. The first place he directs him to, was the sepulchre of one of his ancestors; there he must be reminded of his own mortality, and now that he had a crown before him, must think of his grave, in which all his honour would be laid in the dust. From the time of Samuel there appears to have been schools, or places where pious young men were brought up in the knowledge of Divine things. Saul should find himself strongly moved to join with them, and should be turned into another man from what he had been. The Spirit of God changes men, wonderfully transforms them. Saul, by praising God in the communion of saints, became another man, but it may be questioned if he became a new man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The plain of Tabor - It should be "the oak or terebinth"" of Tabor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a> note). It has been ingeniously conjectured that "Tabor" is either a different form of "Deborah," or a corruption of it, and that the "oak," or "terebinth of Tabor," is the same as "Allon-bachuth," the oak under which Deborah was buried, and which lay "beneath Bethel" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>. The terebinth, where the three men came upon Saul, must have been at some point previous to that where the road leading northward from Jerusalem branches; when they reached that point they would go on with their offerings to Bethel, he would pursue his journey to Gibeah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. the plain&#8212;or, "the oak of Tabor," not the celebrated mount, for that was far distant.<p>three men going up to God to Beth-el&#8212;apparently to offer sacrifices there at a time when the ark and the tabernacle were not in a settled abode, and God had not yet declared the permanent place which He should choose.

Here was an high place as at Ramah, whither in those times, when there was no fixed place for worship, the tabernacle at one place, and the ark at another, the people went up to worship; and they might the rather choose this, because it was a place devoted to the worship and service of God by their father Jacob; so the Targum paraphrases it,"going up to worship God in Bethel;''so Josephus (c), they were going thither to pray, and, as it seems by what follows, to sacrifice: one carrying three kids; which were used in sacrifice, and were a pretty heavy load if carried far; though, according to Josephus (d), it was but one kid: <p>and another carrying three loaves of bread; for the minchah, the meat offering, or rather bread offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>. <p>and another carrying a bottle of wine; for the drink offering, the fourth part of an hin of wine being required for each kid, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5</a>.

He would meet them not <span class="cmt_word">in the plain of Tabor,</span> but at the oak, <span class="accented">elon</span>, of Tabor. Many attempt to connect this <span class="accented">elon-Tabor</span> with the <span class="accented">allon</span>, or oak, under which Deborah, Rachel's nurse, was buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>), and suppose that Tabor is a corruption of the name Deborah. This is scarcely possible, and it is better to acknowledge that we know nothing of the site of this tree, except that it was on the road to Bethel. This was one of the places which Samuel used to visit as judge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>); but these men were on a pilgrimage thither because since the days of Jacob it had been a sacred spot, and a chief seat of the old patriarchal worship, for which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He then ordered the cook to bring the piece which he had directed him to set aside, and to place it before Saul, namely the leg and &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; (the article in the place of the relative; see Ewald, 331, b.); i.e., not what was over it, viz., the broth poured upon it (Dathe and Maurer), but what was attached to it (Luther). The reference, however, is not to the kidney as the choicest portion (Thenius), for the kidneys were burned upon the altar in the case of all the slain sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-4.htm">Leviticus 3:4</a>), and only the flesh of the animals offered in sacrifice was applied to the sacrificial meal. What was attached to the leg, therefore, can only have been such of the fat upon the flesh as was not intended for the altar. Whether the right or left leg, is not stated: the earlier commentators decide in favour of the left, because the right leg fell to the share of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>.). But as Samuel conducted the whole of the sacrificial ceremony, he may also have offered the sacrifice itself by virtue of his prophetic calling, so that the right leg would fall to his share, and he might have it reserved for his guest. In any case, however, the leg, as the largest and best portion, was to be a piece of honour for Saul (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-34.htm">Genesis 43:34</a>). There is no reason to seek for any further symbolical meaning in it. The fact that it was Samuel's intention to distinguish and honour Saul above all his other guests, is evident enough from what he said to Saul when the cook had brought the leg: "Behold, that which is reserved is set before thee (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; is the passive participle, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>); for unto this time hath it been kept for thee, as I said I have invited the people." &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is either "to the appointed time of thy coming," or possibly, "for the (this) meeting together." Samuel mentions this to give Saul his guest to understand that he had foreseen his coming in a supernatural way. &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, saying, i.e., as I said (to the cook). </body></html>
