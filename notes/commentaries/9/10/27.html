It will be remembered that the tribe of Benjamin had been almost entirely destroyed in the civil war related in the concluding chapters of Judges. “They despised him,” because in no way had he made his mark, either in the arts of war or peace. From what has gone before (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?">1Samuel 10:11-12</a> of this 1Sam) it is evident that Saul was a man of no special culture; his early years had been spent in agriculture and work on his father’s lands in the neighbourhood of Gibeah.<p><span class= "bld">And brought him no presents.</span>—These gifts were, in the East, the token of submission and homage; not to offer them to Saul was almost the same thing as to ignore his authority. Although not stated, it is clear that these malcontents were among the chiefs of the greater tribes who had assisted at the election.<p><span class= "bld">But he held his peace.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">he was a deaf man, </span>acting as though he had not heard the murmurs. This prudent conduct showed great self-control and self-denial on the part of the new king and his counsellors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-27.htm" title="But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?

At the same time, to dissemble his knowledge of the scorn they put upon him was an act of great prudence; for if he had taken notice of it, he must have punished it, and it would not have been safe to have begun his reign with an act of severity. Thus Christ held his peace in the day of his patience, but there is a day of recompense coming. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:17-27 Samuel tells the people, Ye have this day rejected your God. So little fond was Saul now of that power, which soon after, when he possessed it, he could not think of parting with, that he hid himself. It is good to be conscious of our unworthiness and insufficiency for the services to which we are called; but men should not go into the contrary extreme, by refusing the employments to which the Lord and the church call them. The greater part of the people treated the matter with indifference. Saul modestly went home to his own house, but was attended by a band of men whose hearts God disposed to support his authority. If the heart bend at any time the right way, it is because He has touched it. One touch is enough when it is Divine. Others despised him. Thus differently are men affected to our exalted Redeemer. There is a remnant who submit to him, and follow him wherever he goes; they are those whose hearts God has touched, whom he has made willing. But there are others who despise him, who ask, How shall this man save us? They are offended in him, and they will be punished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Presents - The &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  m&#305;&#770;ncha&#772;h was the token of homage and acknowledgment from the subject to the sovereign, and from the tributary nation to their suzerain.

And they despised him, and brought him no presents&#8212;In Eastern countries, the honor of the sovereign and the splendor of the royal household are upheld, not by a fixed rate of taxation, but by presents brought at certain seasons by officials, and men of wealth, from all parts of the kingdom, according to the means of the individual, and of a customary registered value. Such was the tribute which Saul's opponents withheld, and for want of which he was unable to set up a kingly establishment for a while. But "biding his time," he bore the insult with a prudence and magnanimity which were of great use in the beginning of his government.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This man; </span> so mean a person, and of the weakest of all the tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Brought him no presents; </span> as subjects in those times and places used to do to their kings; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-25.htm" title="And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.">1 Kings 10:25</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-5.htm" title="Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in abundance.">2 Chronicles 17:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-11.htm" title="And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.">Matthew 2:11</a></span>; and as Saul’s mean condition, herewith they upbraided him, required. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He held his peace; </span> thereby manifesting his prudence and clemency, which was of great use in the beginning of his government. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the children of Belial said,....

He then directed the tribe of Benjamin to draw near according to its families, i.e., he directed the heads of the families of this tribe to come before the altar of the Lord and draw lots; and the family of Matri was taken. Lastly, when the heads of the households in this family came, and after that the different individuals in the household which had been taken, the lot fell upon Saul the son of Kish. In the words, "Saul the son of Kish was taken," the historian proceeds at once to the final result of the casting of the lots, without describing the intermediate steps any further.<p>(Note: It is true the Septuagint introduces the words &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; before &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;, and this clause is also found in a very recent Hebrew MS (viz., 451 in Kennicott's dissert. gener. p. 491). But it is very evident that these words did not form an integral part of the original text, as Thenius supposes, but were nothing more than an interpolation of the Sept. translators, from the simple fact that they do not fill up the supposed gap at all completely, but only in a very partial and in fact a very mistaken manner; for the family of Matri could not come to the lot &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (man by man), but only &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; (by households: <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14</a>). Before the household (beth-aboth, father's house) of Saul could be taken, it was necessary that the &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), i.e., the different heads of households, should be brought; and it was not till then that Kish, or his son Saul, could be singled out as the appointed of the Lord. Neither the author of the gloss in the lxx, nor the modern defender of the gloss, has thought of this.)<p>When the lot fell upon Saul, they sought him, and he could not be found.</body></html>
