It is, however, far better to assume that Samuel had given the young Saul to understand that the revelation respecting his future, and the great state change involved in it, was, in the first instance, for him alone; no other man was as yet to share that great secret with him. In His own good time God would signify His sovereign will and pleasure to Israel; till then, Saul was strictly to keep his own counsel in this important matter. To have imparted the secret to any one would have at once opened the door to secret intrigues and party plotting; one like Abner, especially, would not have been slow in devising schemes to compass so great an end as the placing the crown of Israel on the head of one of his own family.<p>The modesty and humility, as well as the wisdom, of Saul in these early days of his greatness is remarkable. The “changed heart” was indeed an acknowledged fact with him. Wordsworth quotes here how, “in like manner, Samson, in the early days of his humility, told not his parents of the lion. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-6.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.">Judges 14:6</a>.) So Saul of Tarsus spake not of his visions and revelations of the Lord till he was constrained to do so by his enemies.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2Corinthians 12:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-16.htm" title="And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found.

Yet let not an outward show of devotion, and a sudden change for the present, be too much relied on; Saul among the prophets was Saul still. His being anointed was kept private. He leaves it to God to carry on his own work by Samuel, and sits still, to see how the matter will fall.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the order of the narrative, and the mention of Saul's servant, it looks as if Saul found his uncle at the high place.

"Thither" points back to "thither to the city" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>, and is defined by the further expression "to Gibeah" (Eng. version, "to the hill:" Tr.).
