Yet let not an outward show of devotion, and a sudden change for the present, be too much relied on; Saul among the prophets was Saul still. His being anointed was kept private.

The fulfilment of the two first signs [1Sa 10:7, 8] is passed over, but the third is specially described. The spectacle of a man, though more fit to look after his father's cattle than to take part in the sacred exercises of the young prophets&#8212;a man without any previous instruction, or any known taste, entering with ardor into the spirit, and skilfully accompanying the melodies of the sacred band, was so extraordinary a phenomenon, that it gave rise to the proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" (see 1Sa 19:24). The prophetic spirit had come upon him; and to Saul it was as personal and experimental an evidence of the truth of God's word that had been spoken to him, as converts to Christianity have in themselves from the sanctifying power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel,.... When he had taken his leave of him, and set forward on his journey: <p>God gave him another heart; not in a moral or spiritual sense, not a new heart, and a new spirit, as in conversion, but in a civil sense, a right heart, a heart fit for government; filled with wisdom and prudence to rule a people; with courage and magnanimity to protect and defend them against their enemies, and fight for them; a heart not taken up with the affairs of husbandry, with care for his father's asses, and looking after his herds, but filled with concern for the civil welfare of Israel, and with schemes and contrivances for their good, and with warm resolutions to deliver them out of the hands of their enemies: <p>and all these signs came to pass that day; the two first, which are not particularly mentioned as fulfilled, being more private, as finding two men at Rachel's sepulchre, and meeting with three others going to Bethel, which came to pass just as they were described; and the third, which was more public, and gave Saul more reverence and respect among the people, is next particularly observed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it was <i>so</i>, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</span><p>(d) He gave him such virtues as were fitting for a king.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>9–16.

He grew internally up to the level of his changed circumstances. No longer had he the feelings of a husbandman, concerned only about corn and cattle; he had become a statesman, a general, and a prince. No man could have gone through such marvellous events, and experienced such varied emotions, without a vast inward change. But it might have been only to vanity and self-complacency. Saul's change was into a hero. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second sign (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-4.htm">1 Samuel 10:4</a>): "Then thou shalt go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the terebinth of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Bethel, carrying one three kinds, one three loaves of bread, and one a bottle of wine. They will ask thee after thy welfare, and give thee two loaves; receive them at their hands." The terebinth of Tabor is not mentioned anywhere else, and nothing further can be determined concerning it, than that it stood by the road leading from Rachel's tomb to Gibeah.<p>(Note: The opinion expressed by Ewald and Thenius, that Deborah's mourning oak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>) is intended, and that Tabor is either a different form of Deborah, or that Tabor should be altered into Deborah, has no foundation to rest upon; for the fact that the oak referred to stood below (i.e., to the south of) Bethel, and the three men whom Saul was to meet at the terebinth of Tabor were going to Bethel, by no means establishes the identity of the two, as their going up to Bethel does not prove that they were already in the neighbourhood of Bethel. Moreover, the Deborah oak was on the north of Gibeah, whereas Saul met the three men between Rachel's tomb and Gibeah, i.e., to the south of Gibeah.)<p>The fact that the three men were going up to God at Bethel, shows that there was still a place of sacrifice consecrated to the Lord at Bethel, where Abraham and Jacob had erected altars to the Lord who had appeared to them there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3-4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a>); for the kids and loaves and wine were sacrificial gifts which they were about to offer. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, to ask after one's welfare, i.e., to greet in a friendly manner (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-15.htm">Judges 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-27.htm">Genesis 43:27</a>). The meaning of this double sign consisted in the fact that these men gave Saul two loaves from their sacrificial offerings. In this he was to discern a homage paid to the anointed of the Lord; and he was therefore to accept the gift in this sense at their hand.</body></html>
