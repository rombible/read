It need not be assumed that the youth and early manhood of the future king had been wild and dissolute, but simply that the way of life had been rough and uncultured—a life spent in what we should call “country pursuits,” in contradistinction to the pursuit of knowledge and of higher acquirements. It is evident from the statement here and in the following verse that a considerable respect for these schools had already grown up among the people.<p><span class= "bld">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span>—In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm" title="And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.">1Samuel 19:23</a> we again find Saul, but under changed circumstances, under the influence of a Divine and coercing power, and uttering strange words, and singing hymns as one trained in the prophets’ schools. It was probably this recurrence of the same incident in the king’s life which gave rise to the saying, or proverb, which expresses amazement at the unexpected appearance of any man in a position which had hitherto been quite strange to him. “Is Saul among the preachers of Christ? Was a question of wonder asked by the friends of St. Paul” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm" title="But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed.">Galatians 1:23</a>).—<span class= "ital">Wordsworth.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish?

It begat wonder in all those who knew his education, that he should, on a sudden, be inspired as those were, who were bred up in the school of the prophets. For, though it was in the power of God alone to bestow the gift of prophecy upon men, yet it would seem that commonly he endowed none with it, but such as were trained up in those studies which might dispose them for it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:9-16 The signs Samuel had given Saul, came to pass punctually; he found that God had given him another heart, another disposition of mind. Yet let not an outward show of devotion, and a sudden change for the present, be too much relied on; Saul among the prophets was Saul still. His being anointed was kept private. He leaves it to God to carry on his own work by Samuel, and sits still, to see how the matter will fall.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seven days shalt thou tarry ... - The appointment here made is not to be confounded with that mentioned in marginal reference. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-11. when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart&#8212;Influenced by the words of Samuel, as well as by the accomplishment of these signs, Saul's reluctance to undertake the onerous office was overcome. The fulfilment of the two first signs [1Sa 10:7, 8] is passed over, but the third is specially described. The spectacle of a man, though more fit to look after his father's cattle than to take part in the sacred exercises of the young prophets&#8212;a man without any previous instruction, or any known taste, entering with ardor into the spirit, and skilfully accompanying the melodies of the sacred band, was so extraordinary a phenomenon, that it gave rise to the proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" (see 1Sa 19:24). The prophetic spirit had come upon him; and to Saul it was as personal and experimental an evidence of the truth of God's word that had been spoken to him, as converts to Christianity have in themselves from the sanctifying power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What is this that is come unto the son of Kish?</span> what means this strange and prodigious event?

Saul’s neighbours were astonished that the son of Kish, the plain citizen, undistinguished save by his stalwart form and handsome countenance, should suddenly appear as a prophet in the midst of the trained recipients of divine inspiration. But one of their fellow-townsmen reproved them by asking. But who is <span class="ital">their</span> father? Was the parentage of these prophets such as to lead us to expect them to be thus specially gifted? The prophetic inspiration comes from God, and may therefore be bestowed even upon the son of Kish. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/7-14.htm" title="Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:...">Amos 7:14-15</a>. Compare the astonishment of the people of Capernaum at the words and works of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-54.htm" title="And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?...">Matthew 13:54-57</a>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The third sign (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>) Saul was to receive at Gibeah of God, where posts of the Philistines were stationed. Gibeath ha-Elohim is not an appellative, signifying a high place of God, i.e., a high place dedicated to God, but a proper name referring to Gibeah of Benjamin, the native place of Saul, which was called Gibeah of Saul from the time when Saul resided there as king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-16.htm">1 Samuel 10:16</a> : cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-34.htm">1 Samuel 15:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-29.htm">Isaiah 10:29</a>). This is very apparent from the fact that, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>., all the people of Gibeah had known Saul of old, and therefore could not comprehend how he had all at once come to be among the prophets. The name Gibeah of God is here given to the town on account of a bamah or sacrificial height which rose within or near the town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-13.htm">1 Samuel 10:13</a>), and which may possibly have been renowned above other such heights, as the seat of a society of prophets. &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497; are not bailiffs of the Philistines, still less columns erected as signs of their supremacy (Thenius), but military posts of the Philistines, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3-4</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>, clearly show. The allusion here to the posts of the Philistines at Gibeah is connected with what was about to happen to Saul there. At the place where the Philistines, those severe oppressors of Israel, had set up military posts, the Spirit of God was to come upon Saul, and endow him with the divine power that was required for his regal office. "And it shall come to pass, when thou comest to the town there, thou wilt light upon a company of prophets coming down from the high place (bamah, the sacrificial height), before them lyre and tambourin, and flute, and harp, and they prophesying." &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; signifies a rope or cord, then a band or company of men. It does not follow that because this band of prophets was coming down from the high place, the high place at Gibeah must have been the seat of a school of the prophets. They might have been upon a pilgrimage to Gibeah. The fact that they were preceded by musicians playing, seems to indicate a festal procession. Nebel and Kinnor are stringed instruments which were used after David's time in connection with the psalmody of divine worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-20.htm">1 Chronicles 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a>, etc.). The nebel was an instrument resembling a lyre, the kinnor was more like a guitar than a harp. Toph: the tambourin, which was played by Miriam at the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>). Chalil: the flute; see my Bibl. Archaeology, ii. 137. By the prophesying of these prophets we are to understand an ecstatic utterance of religious feelings to the praise of God, as in the case of the seventy elders in the time of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm">Numbers 11:25</a>). Whether it took the form of a song or of an enthusiastic discourse, cannot be determined; in any case it was connected with a very energetic action indicative of the highest state of mental excitement. (For further remarks on these societies of prophets, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-18.htm">1 Samuel 19:18</a>.) </body></html>
