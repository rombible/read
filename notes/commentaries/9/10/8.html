In 1 Samuel 13., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm" title="And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.">1Samuel 10:8</a> and following, a well-known and most important event in Saul’s life and reign is related, in which the circumstances strangely fit in with the words of the warning of Samuel. Only between this first meeting of the seer and the future king and the Gilgal meeting, described in 1 Samuel 13., two years—perhaps even a much longer period—elapsed (the dates of this age are most uncertain); besides which, that famous meeting at Gilgal was not by any means the first meeting of Samuel and Saul at that place. Yet, in spite of these difficulties, it seems best to refer to this meeting between the prophet and king at Gilgal, related in 1 Samuel 13, as the trial of faith especially looked on to by Samuel here. The solemn warning here given was, doubtless, repeated in a much more detailed form by the prophet some time before the appointed Gilgal meeting. So much for the <span class= "ital">reference; </span>the signification of the warning is best explained in the following way:—Samuel had bidden the future king to advance along the paths of glory and difficulty which lay before him in all confidence and trust, acting in each emergency according to the dictates of his own heart—only in <span class= "ital">one </span>thing he must be ever on his guard. In his future great work for the regeneration and advancement of Israel, he must, for the sake of the faith of Israel, be on his guard against infringing the sacred privileges of the religion of the Eternal. In the plenitude of his kingly power, the day would come when the temptation would assault him to disregard the ancient sanctity of the sacrifice, and to assume as king, functions which belonged alone to men like Samuel set apart for the sacred office, and thus publicly to dishonour the commandments of God, and by his reckless example of unbelief in revelation to weaken the faith of the people.<p>Such a temptation presented itself to Saul, we believe, some two or more years from this time, when, as related in 1 Samuel 13, a solemn assembly of the people was summoned to Gilgal, before the commencement of the war of independence. This great enterprise for the people of the Lord must necessarily be begun with solemn religious rites and sacrifices. These the king was forbidden to officiate at without the presence of the Divinely appointed seer. We shall see how King Saul acted under the temptation to set himself and his royal power above the prophet of the Lord and the direct command of God. Whether or no King Saul with his own hand offered the Gilgal sacrifice is uncertain; at all events, the great sin he seemed to have been guilty of having committed, is to have declined to wait for the presence of the prophet of the Lord, although publicly required by the word of the Lord to do so. (See Notes on 1 Samuel 13)<p>The “heart” is mentioned as changed by God, because, according to the conception of the Divine writings, the <span class= "ital">heart </span>is represented as the centre of the whole mental and physical life—of will, desire, thought, perception, and feeling. It was one thing for Samuel the seer to put before the young Benjamite the brilliant destiny which lay before him, but it was another and different thing to transform one like Saul, brought up to merely agricultural pursuits, into a fit and worthy recipient of such honours and powers. We know how utterly incapable are all such things as wealth and rank and power in themselves of inspiring the heart with any noble patriotic aspirations, or with any high religious longings, or lofty patriotic aims; a higher influence is needed to awaken the heart, or to rouse it from merely earthly and sordid contemplations.<p>This is the work which God worked in the heart. of the young Saul as, in the early morning, he left “Ramah of the Watchers,” his ears tingling with the burning words of the great seer all through that day and many succeeding days. In quiet humility, and, no doubt, with many a silent prayer, he watched and waited; when he returned home there was no sign of exultation visible in the man, no mark of impatience. His lips were sealed; he seems to have whispered to no one what the prophet had told him; he made no sign even when events came crowding thick about him—such as the popular assembly for the choice of a king, presided over by the prophet-judge, whose mind Saul alone in Israel knew: the drawing of the lots: the narrowing of the fateful circle: the designation of his tribe, his family, then himself. We see, indeed, God had changed his heart. Was there not in these early days a promise of a noble king—a man after God’s own heart?<p><span class= "bld">And all those signs came to pass that day.</span>—Of the first two signs which were to meet him no further details are given; we are simply told that in the order predicted by Samuel Saul came across them. The third alone gives occasion for a special mention, because it had a great effect on the life of the future king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm" title="And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.">1 Samuel 10:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Seven days shalt thou tarry till I come </span>— This, though now mentioned and commanded, was not immediately to be performed; as is evident, partly from the whole course of the story, (which shows that Saul and Samuel, and the people, first met at Mizpeh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm" title="And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;">1 Samuel 10:17</a>, &c., where Saul was chosen of God, and accepted by the people as king; and afterward went to Gilgal once before the time here spoken of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/11-14.htm" title="Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there....">1 Samuel 11:14-15</a>,) and partly by comparing this place with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm" title="And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.">1 Samuel 13:8</a>, &c., where we find Saul charged with the violation of this command, two years after the giving of it. It seems this was given as a standing rule for Saul to observe while Samuel and he lived; that in case of any great future difficulties, as the invasion of enemies, Saul should resort to Gilgal, and call the people thither, and tarry there seven days, which was but a necessary time for gathering the people, and for the coming of Samuel thither. And Gilgal was chosen for this purpose, because that place was famous for the solemn renewing of the covenant between God and Israel, (Joshua 4.,) and for other eminent instances of God’s favour to them, the remembrance whereof was a confirmation of their faith; and because it was a very convenient place for the tribes within and without Jordan to assemble in, and consult, and unite their forces together upon such occasions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 The sacred anointing, then used, pointed at the great Messiah, or Anointed One, the King of the church, and High Priest of our profession, who was anointed with the oil of the Spirit, not by measure, but without measure, and above all the priests and princes of the Jewish church. For Saul's further satisfaction, Samuel gives him some signs which should come to pass the same day. The first place he directs him to, was the sepulchre of one of his ancestors; there he must be reminded of his own mortality, and now that he had a crown before him, must think of his grave, in which all his honour would be laid in the dust. From the time of Samuel there appears to have been schools, or places where pious young men were brought up in the knowledge of Divine things. Saul should find himself strongly moved to join with them, and should be turned into another man from what he had been. The Spirit of God changes men, wonderfully transforms them. Saul, by praising God in the communion of saints, became another man, but it may be questioned if he became a new man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seven days shalt thou tarry ... - The appointment here made is not to be confounded with that mentioned in marginal reference. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal&#8212;This, according to Josephus, was to be a standing rule for the observance of Saul while the prophet and he lived; that in every great crisis, such as a hostile incursion on the country, he should repair to Gilgal, where he was to remain seven days, to afford time for the tribes on both sides Jordan to assemble, and Samuel to reach it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Seven days shalt thou tarry till I come to thee:</span> this, though now mentioned and commanded, yet was not immediately to be performed; as is evident, partly from the whole course of the story, which shows that Saul, and Samuel, and the people first met at Mizpeh, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm" title="And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;">1 Samuel 10:17</a></span>, &c., where Saul was chosen by God and accepted by the people as king; and afterwards went to Gilgal, once before the time here spoken of, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-14.htm" title="Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.">1 Samuel 11:14</a>,15</span>; and partly by comparing this place with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm" title="And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.">1 Samuel 13:8</a></span>, &c., where we find Saul charged with the violation of this command two years after the giving of it, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm" title="Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,">1 Samuel 13:1</a>,2</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> How then is this to be understood? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 1. This may be given as a standing rule for Saul to observe while Samuel and he lived; that in case of any great future difficulties, as the invasion of enemies, Saul should resort to Gilgal, and call the people thither, and tarry there seven days, which was but a reasonable and necessary time for the gathering of the people, and for the coming of Samuel thither. For though this be related as but once done, <span class="bld"> 1Sa 13</span>, yet Josephus affirms that it was to be constantly practised upon all such occasions. And Gilgal was chosen for this purpose as a very fit place; partly because that place was famous for the solemn renewing of the covenant between God and Israel, <span class="bld"> Jos 4</span>, and for other eminent instances of God’s favour to them, the remembrance whereof was a notable confirmation of their faith; and partly because it was a very convenient place for the tribes within and without Jordan to assemble, and consult, and unite their forces together upon such occasions. If you ask, Why then Saul did not practise this precept upon the first invasion of the Ammonites? it may be answered, that this was a rule for Saul when he and Samuel were asunder, whereas they were together in that expedition, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-7.htm" title="And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.">1 Samuel 11:7</a></span>. And further, that necessity did excuse the violation of this precept then, because Saul could not wait for Samuel, nor forbear his action for seven days, as is evident from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-3.htm" title="And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers to all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to you.">1 Samuel 11:3</a>,9,10</span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. (which I propose with submission to the learned and judicious) This may be here added as another sign to confirm his faith, which having strengthened by three foregoing signs, he now fortifies it by another sign which was to follow afterwards; it being very usual for God to give men signs to confirm their faith from future events; as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm" title="And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.">Exodus 3:12</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.">2 Kings 19:29</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-13.htm" title="And he said, Hear you now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?">Isaiah 7:13</a>,14</span>. So the meaning maybe this, Another sign will I add to strengthen thy faith: <span class="ital">Thou shalt</span> in due time, and upon a great occasion which shall then happen, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">go down before me to Gilgal, </span> and there <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will come down unto thee to offer—sacrifices, </span>& c.

Not immediately; for the first summons of the people, and of Saul, and the first meeting of them by Samuel, were at Mizpeh, where Saul was chosen by lot; nor the first time of Saul's being at Gilgal, when the kingdom was renewed; for Saul had no need to wait seven days there, since he and Samuel went together, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a> rather at the second time of his being there, where not staying the time quite up, was reproved for it, which was two years after this, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a>, though it may be this was a general rule to be observed by Saul, that whenever anything turned up of importance to the children of Israel, and was a difficulty with him, he should go to Gilgal, and there wait seven days for Samuel, from the time he gave him notice of it, who would come at the appointed time, and would give him what advice and instructions were necessary; and this place was the rather appointed, because it was the place where the Israelites first pitched their camp when they came over Jordan, and where the tabernacle first was; and where prayer and sacrifices were wont to be made; and where the kingdom of Saul was renewed; and which lay convenient for all the tribes, both on the one and the other side of Jordan: <p>and, behold, I will come down to thee to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings; so he did when the kingdom was renewed, and Saul was confirmed in it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a> but two years after, Saul not staying the full time, he offered them himself by another, for which he was reproved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>. <p>seven days shalt thou tarry till I come to thee; either from the time of the notice he should give to Samuel of his going thither, or from the time of his arrival there; for it can by no means be understood as from the time of his present departure from him, for the reasons before given: <p>and show thee what thou shalt do; in the then present emergency or difficulty on his hands; and this he said to encourage him under the weight and burden of government laid upon him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal</span>] Better, <span class="bld">and when thou goest down before me to Gilgal.</span> This is not to be understood as a direction to meet Samuel at Gilgal at once. The injunction applies to some future occasion whenever it might be, of which they had been talking. Doubtless Samuel and Saul had been discussing the best means of shaking off the Philistine yoke, and had agreed upon a muster of the people at Gilgal, as the national centre furthest from the Philistine power. Samuel’s parting injunction to Saul is to take no step independently. The king must wait for the prophet’s sanction to strike the blow. The fitting opportunity for the muster did not come for several years, and when it came Saul disobeyed Samuel’s command. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm" title="And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.">1 Samuel 13:8</a> ff.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal.</span> We find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-13</a> a meeting at Gilgal so exactly parallel to what is arranged here that we cannot help looking upon this, again, as a sort of sign to be fulfilled at a later period. It is no argument against it that Gilgal was the place where in the mean while Saul was solemnly inaugurated king; for he was appointed in order that he might deliver Israel from the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>), and we may feel sure that this grand purpose would form the subject of conversation between the prophet and the soldier, either on the house-top or the next morning. In this conversation Gilgal would be selected as the place where Saul would assemble Israel for the war of independence (so Rashi and other Jewish interpreters); and so great an enterprise must necessarily be begun with religious rites, and Saul was to wait a full week for the prophet's coming, both to try his faith, which ought to have been confirmed by the fulfilment of the three appointed signs, and in order that the war might be undertaken under the same holy auspices as his own election to the kingdom. The two years' interval, were it really so long, would give time for Saul's character to develop under the forcing influences of royalty, and it would then be proved, when he felt himself every inch a king, whether he was still as amenable to the Divine authority as when he was first summoned from obscurity to mount a kingly throne. But, really, the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a> do not justify this conclusion, and most probably the occurrences mentioned in that chapter followed immediately upon Saul's confirmation as king. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To confirm the consecration of Saul as king over Israel, which had been effected through the anointing, Samuel gave him three more signs which would occur on his journey home, and would be a pledge to him that Jehovah would accompany his undertakings with His divine help, and practically accredit him as His anointed. These signs, therefore, stand in the closest relation to the calling conveyed to Saul through his anointing.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a><p>The first sign: "When thou goest away from me to-day (i.e., now), thou wilst meet two men at Rachel's sepulchre, on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses of thy father, which thou wentest to seek, are found. Behold, they father hath given up &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, the words (i.e., talking) about the asses, and troubleth himself about you, saying, What shall I do about my son?" According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16</a>., Rachel's sepulchre was on the way from Bethel to Bethlehem, only a short distance from the latter place, and therefore undoubtedly on the spot which tradition has assigned to it since the time of Jerome, viz., on the site of the Kubbet Rahil, half an hour to the north-west of Bethlehem, on the left of the road to Jerusalem, about an hour and a half from the city (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-20.htm">Genesis 35:20</a>). This suits the passage before us very well, if we give up the groundless assumption that Saul came to Samuel at Ramah and was anointed by him there, and assume that the place of meeting, which is not more fully defined in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9.htm">1 Samuel 9</a>, was situated to the south-west of Bethlehem.<p>(Note: As the account of Saul's meeting with Samuel, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9.htm">1 Samuel 9</a>, when properly understood, is not at variance with the tradition concerning the situation of Rachel's tomb, and the passage before us neither requires us on the one had to understand the Ephratah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-7.htm">Genesis 48:7</a> as a different place from Bethlehem, and erase "that is Bethlehem" from both passages as a gloss that has crept into the text, and then invent an Ephratah in the neighbourhood of Bethel between Benjamin and Ephraim, as Thenius does, nor warrants us on the other hand in transferring Rachel's tomb to the neighbourhood of Bethel, in opposition to the ordinary tradition, as Kurtz proposes; so the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children," etc., furnish no evident that Rachel's tomb was at Ramah (i.e., er Rm). "For here (in the cycle of prophecy concerning the restoration of all Israel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30.htm">Jeremiah 30-33</a>) Rachel's weeping is occasioned by the fact of the exiles of Benjamin having assembled together in Ramah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>), without there being any reason why Rachel's tomb should be sought for in the neighbourhood of this Ramah" (Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-20.htm">Genesis 35:20</a>).)<p>The expression "in the border of Benjamin" is not at variance with this. It is true that Kubbet Rahil is about an hour and a quarter from the southern boundary of Benjamin, which ran past the Rogel spring, through the valley of Ben-hinnom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>); but the expression &#1511;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1501; must not be so pressed as to be restricted to the actual site of the grave, since otherwise the further definition "at Zelzah" would be superfluous, as Rachel's tomb was unquestionably a well-known locality at that time. If we suppose the place called Zelzah, the situation of which has not yet been discovered,<p>(Note: Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 29) supposes Zelzah to be unsuitable to the context, if taken as the name of a place, and therefore follows the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; of the lxx, and renders the word "in great haste;" but he has neither given any reason why the name of a place is unsuitable here, nor considered that the Septuagint rendering is merely conjectural, and has nothing further to support it than the fact that the translators rendered &#1510;&#1500;&#1495; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;, "he sprang upon him," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-6.htm">1 Samuel 11:6</a>, and took &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1495; to be an emphatic form of &#1510;&#1500;&#1495;.)<p>to have been about mid-way between Rachel's tomb and the Rogel spring, Samuel could very well describe the spot where Saul would meet the two men in the way that he has done. This sign, by confirming the information which Samuel had given to Saul with reference to the asses, was to furnish him with a practical proof that what Samuel had said to him with regard to the monarchy would quite as certainly come to pass, and therefore not only to deliver him from all anxiety as to the lost animals of his father, but also to direct his thoughts to the higher destiny to which God had called him through Samuel's anointing.</body></html>
