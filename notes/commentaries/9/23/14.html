Some of these “stations” in the wanderings of the future king are only doubtfully identified. Cowper’s musical—though perhaps, according to our recent canons of taste, old-fashioned—lines well describe the Psalmist-king’s weary wanderings during this portion of his chequered career:—<p>“See Judah’s promised king bereft of all,<p>Driven out an exile from the face of Saul.<p>To distant caves the lonely wanderer flies,<p>To seek that peace a tyrant’s frown denies.<p>His soul exults; hope animates his lays;<p>The sense of mercy kindles into praise;<p>And wilds familiar with the lion s roar<p>Ring with ecstatic sounds unheard before.”<p>COWPER.<p><span class= "bld">Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him.</span>—This is merely a general remark, and intended to cover a long period of time, including the remaining portion of Saul’s reign, during which David was perpetually exposed to Saul’s attempts to destroy him. It quietly mentions also that though Saul was armed with all the power of the king in Israel, he was powerless, for the invisible King of Israel declined to give this hated David into his hand.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:14-18 David made no attempt against Saul; he kept God's way, waited God's time, and was content to secure himself in woods and wildernesses. Let it make us think the worse of this world, which often gives such bad treatment to its best men: let it make us long for that kingdom where goodness shall for ever be in glory, and holiness in honour. We find Jonathan comforting David. As a pious friend, he directed him to God, the Foundation of his comfort. As a self-denying friend, he takes pleasure in the prospect of David's advancement to the throne. As a constant friend, he renewed his friendship with him. Our covenant with God should be often renewed, and therein our communion with him kept up. If the converse of one friend, at one meeting, gives comfort and strengthens our hearts, what may not be expected from the continual supports and powerful love of the Saviour of sinners, the covenanted Friend of believers!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ziph is placed between Hebron and En-gedi (marginal references).

David Escapes to Ziph.<p>14, 15. David abode in the wilderness &#8230; of Ziph&#8212;A mountainous and sequestered region was generally called a wilderness, and took its name from some large town in the district. Two miles southeast of Hebron, and in the midst of a level plain, is Tell-ziph, an isolated and conical hillock, about a hundred feet high, probably the acropolis [Van De Velde], or the ruins [Robinson] of the ancient city of Ziph, from which the surrounding wilderness was called. It seems, anciently, to have been covered by an extensive woods.
