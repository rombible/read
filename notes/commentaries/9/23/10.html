Christ was used thus basely. David applied to his great Protector for direction. No sooner was the ephod brought him than he made use of it. We have the Scriptures in our hands, let us take advice from them in doubtful cases. Say, Bring hither the Bible. David's address to God is very solemn, also very particular. God allows us to be so in our addresses to him; Lord, direct me in this matter, about which I am now at a loss. God knows not only what will be, but what would be, if it were not hindered; therefore he knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and how to render to every man according to his works.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If Gad was with David at the forest of Hareth <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a>, and there inquired for him of the Lord <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-4.htm">1 Samuel 23:4</a>, but did not accompany him to Keilah, and if Abiathar's flight occurred at the time of David's being at Keilah, we have an additional striking instance of God's watchful providential care of David in thus sending Abiathar to supply the place of Gad at so critical a moment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod&#8212;The consultation was made, and the prayer uttered, by means of the priest. The alternative conditions here described have often been referred to as illustrating the doctrine of God's foreknowledge and preordination of events.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> David said this by the priest, for he was to make the inquiry of God, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a></span>, and David puts the words into his mouth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said David,.... By the priest, for it was he that put the questions for and in the name of the inquirer: <p>O Lord God of Israel; the great Jehovah, the covenant God of his people, who always has a merciful regard unto them: <p>thy servant hath certainly heard; had good information of it, on which he could depend: <p>that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah; that was his intention and resolution: <p>to destroy the city for my sake; to besiege it, and demolish it, if that was necessary, in order to take him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But his men said to him, "Behold, here in Judah we are in fear (i.e., are not safe from Saul's pursuit); how shall we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?" In order, therefore, to infuse courage into them, he inquired of the Lord again, and received the assurance from God, "I will give the Philistines into thy hand." He then proceeded with his men, fought against the Philistines, drove off their cattle, inflicted a severe defeat upon them, and thus delivered the inhabitants of Keilah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a> a supplementary remark is added in explanation of the expression "inquired of the Lord," to the effect that, when Abiathar fled to David to Keilah, the ephod had come to him. The words "to David to Keilah" are not to be understood as signifying that Abiathar did not come to David till he was in Keilah, but that when he fled after David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a>), he met with him as he was already preparing for the march of Keilah, and immediately proceeded with him thither. For whilst it is not stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a> that Abiathar came to David in the wood of Hareth, but the place of meeting is left indefinite, the fact that David had already inquired of Jehovah (i.e., through the oracle of the high priest) with reference to the march to Keilah, compels us to assume that Abiathar had come to him before he left the mountains for Keilah. So that the brief expression "to David to Keilah," which is left indefinite because of its brevity, must be interpreted in accordance with this fact.</body></html>
