Such expressions, without suitable effects, can only amuse or deceive those who hear, and those who use them. This mountain was an emblem of the Divine Providence coming between David and the destroyer. Let us not be dismayed at the prospect of future difficulties, but stay ourselves upon Him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working. Sooner than his promise shall fail, he will commission Philistines to effect our escape, at the very moment when our case appears most desperate.

Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us?&#8212;From the tell of Ziph a panorama of the whole surrounding district is to be seen. No wonder, then, that the Ziphites saw David and his men passing to and fro in the mountains of the wilderness. Spying him at a distance when he ventured to show himself on the hill of Hachilah, "on the right hand of the wilderness," that is, the south side of Ziph, they sent in haste to Saul, to tell him of the lurking place of his enemy [Van De Velde].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It shall be our care and business to the utmost of our power.

From Gibeah to Ziph, and the wilderness of it, where David was: <p>according to all the desires of thy soul to come down; to seize such a prey which he was greatly desirous of, and of nothing more so than of that according to Abarbinel, the sense is, that the thing was ready in whatever way he should desire it; if he chose to come down himself, and lay hold on him, they invite him to come down; but if he did not choose to come down himself, they would seize him, and bring him to him, and deliver him up into his hand, and so he would be under no necessity of going down after him: <p>and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand; this we will take upon us to do, and save the king the trouble of coming down. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David retreated into the desert (of Judah), to the mountain heights (that were to be found there), and remained on the mountains in the desert of Ziph. The "desert of Judah" is the desert tract between the mountains of Judah and the Dead Sea, in its whole extent, from the northern boundary of the tribe of Judah to the Wady Fikreh in the south (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-61.htm">Joshua 15:61</a>). Certain portions of this desert, however, received different names of their own, according to the names of different towns on the border of the mountains and desert. The desert of Ziph was that portion of the desert of Judah which was near to and surrounded the town of Ziph, the name of which has been retained in the ruins of Tell Zif, an hour and three-quarters to the south-east of Hebron (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>. "And Saul sought him all the days, but God delivered him not into his hand." This is a general remark, intended to introduce the accounts which follow, of the various attempts made by Saul to get David into his power. "All the days," i.e., as long as Saul lived. </body></html>
