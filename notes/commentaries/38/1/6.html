It is very desirable to have the Lord of hosts for our friend, and very dreadful to have him for our enemy. Review what is past, and observe the message God sent by his servants, the prophets, to your fathers. Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings. Be persuaded to leave your sins, as the only way to prevent approaching ruin. What is become of our fathers, and of the prophets that preached to them? They are all dead and gone. Here they were, in the towns and countries where we live, passing and repassing in the same streets, dwelling in the same houses, trading in the same shops and exchanges, worshipping God in the same places. But where are they? When they died, there was not an end of them; they are in eternity, in the world of spirits, the unchangeable world to which we hasten apace. Where are they? Those of them who lived and died in sin, are in torment. Those who lived and died in Christ, are in heaven; and if we live and die as they did, we shall be with them shortly and eternally. If they minded not their own souls, is that a reason why their posterity should ruin theirs also? The prophets are gone. Christ is a Prophet that lives for ever, but all other prophets have a period put to their office. Oh that this consideration had its due weight; that dying ministers are dealing with dying people about their never-dying souls, and an awful eternity, upon the brink of which both are standing! In another world, both we and our prophets shall live for ever: to prepare for that world ought to be our great care in this. The preachers died, and the hearers died, but the word of God died not; not one jot or title of it fell to the ground; for he is righteous.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Only My words and My decrees - Which God spake by them, "did not they overtake them?"

On the basis of the repentance, of which the people were giving practical proof in their honest endeavours to rebuild the Temple, and as an encouragement to them to persevere in the work, Zechariah now unfolds to them God’s purposes of mercy, as they had been unfolded to him in a series of eight visions, all of which had been vouchsafed to him, as it would seem, in a single night.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My words</span>.

Hab 1:2. "How long, Jehovah, have I cried, and Thou hearest not? I cry to Thee, Violence; and Thou helpest not! <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>. Why dost Thou let me see mischief, and Thou lookest upon distress? devastation and violence are before me: there arises strife, and contention lifts itself up. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-4.htm">Habakkuk 1:4</a>. Therefore the law is benumbed, and justice comes not forth for ever: for sinners encircle the righteous man; therefore justice goes forth perverted." This complaint, which involves a petition for help, is not merely an expression of the prophet's personal desire for the removal of the prevailing unrighteousness; but the prophet laments, in the name of the righteous, i.e., the believers in the nation, who had to suffer under the oppression of the wicked; not, however, as Rosenmller and Ewald, with many of the Rabbins, suppose, over the acts of wickedness and violence which the Chaldaeans performed in the land, but over the wicked conduct of the ungodly of his own nation. For it is obvious that these verses refer to the moral depravity of Judah, from the fact that God announced His purpose to raise up the Chaldaeans to punish it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>.). It is true that, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-9.htm">Habakkuk 1:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>, wickedness and violence are attributed to the Chaldaeans also; but all that can be inferred from this is, that "in the punishment of the Jewish people a divine talio prevails, which will eventually fall upon the Chaldaeans also" (Delitzsch). The calling for help (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; is described, in the second clause, as crying over wickedness. &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; is an accusative, denoting what he cries, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>, viz., the evil that is done. Not hearing is equivalent to not helping. The question &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492; indicates that the wicked conduct has continued a long time, without God having put a stop to it. This appears irreconcilable with the holiness of God. Hence the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a> : Wherefore dost Thou cause me to see mischief, and lookest upon it Thyself? which points to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a>, viz., to the words of Balaam, "God hath not beheld iniquity ('a&#770;ven) in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness (&#8219;a&#770;ma&#770;l) in Israel." This word of God, in which Balaam expresses the holiness of Israel, which remains true to the idea of its divine election, is put before the Lord in the form of a question, not only to give prominence to the falling away of the people from their divine calling, and their degeneracy into the very opposite of what they ought to be, but chiefly to point to the contradiction involved in the fact, that God the Holy One does now behold the evil in Israel and leave it unpunished. God not only lets the prophet see iniquity, but even looks at Himself. This is at variance with His holiness. &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, nothingness, then worthlessness, wickedness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>). &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, labour, then distress which a man experiences or causes to others (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1</a>). &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;, to see, not to cause to see. Ewald has revoked the opinion, that we have here a fresh hiphil, derived from a hiphil. With &#1513;&#1473;&#1491; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; the address is continued in the form of a simple picture. Sho&#772;d vecha&#770;ma&#770;s are often connected (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-9.htm">Ezekiel 45:9</a>). Sho&#772;d is violent treatment causing desolation. Cha&#770;ma&#770;s is malicious conduct intended to injure another. &#1493;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;, it comes to pass, there arises strife (r&#305;&#772;bh) in consequence of the violent and wicked conduct. &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, to rise up, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>. The consequences of this are relaxation of the law, etc. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, therefore, because God does not interpose to stop the wicked conduct. &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;, to relax, to stiffen, i.e., to lose one's vital strength, or energy. To&#772;ra&#770;h is "the revealed law in all its substance, which was meant to be the soul, the heart of political, religious, and domestic life" (Delitzsch). Right does not come forth, i.e., does not manifest itself, la&#770;netsach, lit., for a permanence, i.e., for ever, as in many other passages, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-2.htm">Psalm 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>. &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495; belongs to &#1500;&#1488;, not for ever, i.e., never more. Mishpa&#770;t is not merely a righteous verdict, however; in which case the meaning would be: There is no more any righteous verdict given, but a righteous state of things, objective right in the civil and political life. For godless men (&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, without an article, is used with indefinite generality or in a collective sense) encircle the righteous man, so that the righteous cannot cause right to prevail. Therefore right comes forth perverted. The second clause, commencing with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, completes the first, adding a positive assertion to the negative. The right, which does still come to the light, is &#1502;&#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;, twisted, perverted, the opposite of right. To this complaint Jehovah answers in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5-11</a> that He will do a marvellous work, inflict a judgment corresponding in magnitude to the prevailing injustice. </body></html>
