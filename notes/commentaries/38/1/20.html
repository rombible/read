They are horns, emblems of power, strength, and violence. The prophet saw them so formidable that he began to despair of the safety of every good man, and the success of every good work; but the Lord showed him four workmen empowered to cut off these horns. With an eye of sense we see the power of the enemies of the church; look which way we will, the world shows us that; but it is only with an eye of faith that we see it safe. The Lord shows us that. When God has work to do, he will raise up some to do it, and others to defend it, and to protect those employed in doing it. What cause there is to look up in love and praise to the holy and eternal Spirit, who has the same care over the present and eternal interests of believers, by the holy word bringing the church to know the wonderful things of salvation!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These are the horns which have scattered - o "The four horns which scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem, are four nations, Babylonians, Medes and Persians, Macedonians and Romans; as the Lord, on the prophet's enquiry, explains here, and Daniel unfolds most fully <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>; who in the vision of the image with golden head, silver breast, belly and thighs of brass, feet of iron and clay, explained it of these four nations, and again in another vision of four beasts <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, lion, bear, leopard and another unnamed dreadful beast, he pointed out the same nations under another figure. But that the Medes and Persians, after the victory of Cyrus, were one kingdom, no one will doubt, who reads secular and sacred literature. When this vision was beheld, the kingdom of the Babylonians had now passed away, that of the Medes and Persians was instant; that of Greeks and Macedonians and of the Romans was yet to come.<p>What the Babylonians, what the Medes and Persians, what the Greeks that is, the Macedonians, did to Judah, Israel and Jerusalem, a learned man acknowledgeth, especially under Antiochus, surnamed Epiphanes, to which the history of the Maccabees belongs. After the Coming of our Lord and Saviour, when Jerusalem was encompassed, Josephus, a native writer, tells most fully, what the Israelites endured, and the Gospel fore-announced. These horns dispersed Judah almost individually, so that, bowed down by the heavy weight of evils, no one of them raised his head." Though these were successive in time, they are exhibited to Zechariah as one. One whole are the efforts against God's Church; one whole are the instruments of God, whether angelic or human, in doing or suffering, to repel them. Zechariah then exhibits these hostile powers as past and gone, as each would be at the end, having put forth his passing might, and perishing. They scattered, each in its day, and disappeared; for the next displaced it.<p>The long schism being ended, Judah and Israel are again one; and Jerusalem, the place of God's worship, belongs to Israel as well as to Judah.<p>The explanation of the number four, as symbolizing contemporaneous attacks from the four quarters of the heavens, fails in matter of fact, that, in these later times, the Jews suffered always from one power at a time. There was no such fourfold attack. In Zechariah's time all around was Persian.<p>Osorius: "Those horns, broken by the angels' ministry, portended that no guilt against the church of Christ should be unpunished. Never will there be wanting fierce enemies from east, west, north, or south, whom God will strengthen, in order by them to teach His own. But when He shall see His work finished, that is, when He shall have cleansed the stains of His own and brought back His Church to her former purity, He will punish those who so fiercely afflicted her."<p>Spiritually, (Jerome), "those who destroy vices, build up virtues, and all the saints who, possessing these remedies, ever build up the Church, may be called 'builders.' Whence the Apostle says, "I, as a wise builder, laid the foundation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; and the Lord, when wroth, said that He would "take away from Jerusalem artificer and wise man" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a>.

The Jews say (z) these four carpenters are Messiah ben David, Messiah ben Ephraim, Elijah, and the priest of righteousness; or, as elsewhere (a), Elijah, the King Messiah, Melchizedek, and he that was anointed for war; though Kimchi much better interprets them of the kings, the princes above, who preside over kingdoms, that is, the angels; and so Jerom and Theodoret; who have been sometimes employed in the destruction of the enemies of God's people, or in preventing them doing the mischief they otherwise would; and even the several monarchies themselves have been the means of destroying each other; so the Babylonians were destroyed by the Medes and Persians; the Persians by the Grecians; the Grecians by the Romans; and the Romans by the Goths, Hunns, Vandals, &amp;c. in the western part of the empire; and by the Saracens and Turks in the eastern part of it: and they may be applied to the apostles of Christ, who were chiefly mechanics, mean and illiterate persons, yet workmen in the Gospel, that need not to be ashamed; and who were sent by Christ into the four parts of the world, to spread his Gospel, set up his interest, and pull down the kingdom of Satan: and since the Jews make the Messiah himself one of these carpenters, they have no reason to upbraid or be offended at Jesus our Messiah being a carpenter, and a carpenter's son, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a> and Kimchi owns that their ancient Rabbins explain this verse of the days of the Messiah. <p>(y) "fabros ferrarios", Pembellus, Sanctius, Burkius.

There is no ground for the idea that these artificers represent angelic ministries. They rather indicate generally the various human agencies, corresponding in number and variety to the enemies of Israel, by the instrumentality of which those enemies should be overthrown. “Comparat gentes, quæ infestæ fuerant Judæis, cornibus: postea comparet fabris alios hostes, quorum manu et opera utitur Deus ad frangendos conatus eorum omnium, qui molesti erunt ecclesiæ.” Calvin.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Four carpenters;</span> <span class="accented">craftsmen</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">smiths</span>, in which case "the horns" would be made of iron.

Their number is the same as that of the "horns," thus showing their adequacy for the work which they have to execute. It is quite unnecessary to attempt to identify the four "craftsmen." Some take them to be Zerubbabel, Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah; or Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Cambyses, and Alexander the Great; or the four evangelists; or generally, angels. We shall be safer if we look upon them merely as God's instruments and servants without further identification. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1-3</a> form the introduction to the word of God, which the prophet receives in reply to his cry of lamentation addressed to the Lord in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12-17</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>. "I will stand upon my watchtower, and station myself upon the fortress, and will watch to see what He will say in me, and what I answer to my complaint. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>. Then Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that he may run who reads it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>. For the vision is yet fore the appointed end, and strives after the end, and does not lie: if it tarry, wait for it; for it will come, it does not fail." <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a> contains the prophet's conversation with himself. After he has poured out his trouble at the judgment announced, in a lamentation to the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12-17</a>), he encourages himself - after a pause, which we have to imagine after <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a> - to wait for the answer from God. He resolves to place himself upon his observatory, and look out for the revelation which the Lord will give to his questions. Mishmereth, a place of waiting or observing; ma&#770;tso&#772;r, a fortress, i.e., a watch-tower or spying-tower. Standing upon the watch, and stationing himself upon the fortification, are not to be understood as something external, as Hitzig supposes, implying that the prophet went up to a steep and lofty place, or to an actual tower, that he might be far away from the noise and bustle of men, and there turn his eyes towards heaven, and direct his collected mind towards God, to look out for a revelation. For nothing is known of any such custom as this, since the cases mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-21.htm">Exodus 33:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>, as extraordinary preparations for God to reveal Himself, are of a totally different kind from this; and the fact that Balaam the soothsayer went up to the top of a bare height, to look out for a revelation from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a>), furnishes not proof that the true prophets of Jehovah did the same, but is rather a heathenish feature, which shows that it was because Balaam did not rejoice in the possession of a firm prophetic word, that he looked out for revelations from God in significant phenomena of nature (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3-4</a>). The words of our verse are to be taken figuratively, or internally, like the appointment of the watchman in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>. The figure is taken from the custom of ascending high places for the purpose of looking into the distance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a>), and simply expresses the spiritual preparation of the prophet's soul for hearing the word of God within, i.e., the collecting of his mind by quietly entering into himself, and meditating upon the word and testimonies of God. Cyril and Calvin bring out the first idea. Thus the latter observes, that "the watch-tower is the recesses of the mind, where we withdraw ourselves from the world;" and then adds by way of explanation, "The prophet, under the name of the watch-tower, implies that he extricates himself as it were from the thoughts of the flesh, because there would be no end or measure, if he wished to judge according to his own perception;" whilst others find in it nothing more than firm continuance in reliance upon the word of God.<p>(Note: Theodoret very appropriately compares the words of Asaph in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-16.htm">Psalm 73:16</a>., "When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me, until I entered into the sanctuaries of God, and gave heed to their end;" and observes, "And there, says the prophet, will I remain as appointed, and not leave my post, but, standing upon such a rock as that upon which God placed great Moses, watch with a prophet's eyes for the solution of the things that Iseek.")<p>Tsippa&#770;h, to spy or watch, to wait for the answer from God. "This watching was lively and assiduous diligence on the part of the prophet, in carefully observing everything that took place in the spirit of his mind, and presented itself either to be seen or heard" (Burk). &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, to speak in me, not merely to or with me; since the speaking of God to the prophets was an internal speaking, and not one that was perceptible from without. What I shall answer to my complaint (&#8219;al to&#772;khacht&#305;&#772;), namely, first of all to myself and then to the rest. To&#772;khachath, lit., correction, contradiction. Habakkuk refers to the complaint which he raised against God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13-17</a>, namely, that He let the wicked go on unpunished. He will wait for an answer from God to this complaint, to quiet his own heart, which is dissatisfied with the divine administration. Thus he draws a sharp distinction between his own speaking and the speaking of the Spirit of God within him. Jehovah gives the answer in what follows, first of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>) commanding him to write the vision (cha&#770;zo&#772;n, the revelation from God to be received by inward intuition) upon tables, so clearly, that men may be able to read it in running, i.e., quite easily.<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-8.htm">Deuteronomy 27:8</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>. The article attached to &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; does not point to the tables set up in the market-places for public notices to be written upon (Ewald), but simply means, make it clear on the tables on which thou shalt write it, referring to the noun implied in &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; (write), though not expressed (Delitzsch). &#1511;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1493; may be explained from &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-13.htm">Jeremiah 36:13</a>. The question is a disputed one, whether this command is to be understood literally or merely figuratively, "simply denoting the great importance of the prophecy, and the consequent necessity for it to be made accessible to the whole nation" (Hengstenberg, Dissertation, vol. i. p. 460). The passages quoted in support of the literal view, i.e., of the actual writing of the prophecy which follows upon tables, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>, are not decisive. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a> the prophet is commanded to write all the words of the Lord in a book (se&#772;pher); and so again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>, if &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is synonymous with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a> there are only two significant words, which the prophet is to write upon a large table after having taken witnesses. It does not follow from either of these passages, that lucho&#772;th, tables, say wooden tables, had been already bound together into books among the Hebrews, so that we could be warranted in identifying the writing plainly upon tables with writing in a book. We therefore prefer the figurative view, just as in the case of the command issued to Daniel, to shut up his prophecy and seal it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>), inasmuch as the literal interpretation of the command, especially of the last words, would require that the table should be set up or hung out in some public place, and this cannot for a moment be thought of. The words simply express the thought, that the prophecy is to be laid to heart by all the people on account of its great importance, and that not merely in the present, but in the future also. This no doubt involved the obligation on the part of the prophet to take care, by committing it to writing, that it did not fall into oblivion. The reason for the writing is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>. The prophecy is &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, for the appointed time; i.e., it relates to the period fixed by God for its realization, which was then still (&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;) far off. &#1500; denotes direction towards a certain point either of place or time. The vision had a direction towards a point, which, when looked at from the present, was still in the future. This goal was the end (&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509; towards which it hastened, i.e., the "last time" (&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1511;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>; and &#1506;&#1514; &#1511;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>), the Messianic times, in which the judgment would fall upon the power of the world. &#1497;&#1508;&#1495; &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509;, it pants for the end, inhiat fini, i.e., it strives to reach the end, to which it refers. "True prophecy is inspired, as it were, by an impulse to fulfil itself" (Hitzig). &#1497;&#1508;&#1495; is not an adjective, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>, but the third pers. imperf. hiphil of pu&#772;a&#774;ch; and the contracted form (&#1497;&#1508;&#1495; for &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495;), without a voluntative meaning, is the same as we frequently meet with in the loftier style of composition. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1499;&#1494;&#1468;&#1489;, "and does not deceive," i.e., will assuredly take place. If it (the vision) tarry, i.e., be not fulfilled immediately, wait for it, for it will surely take place (the inf. abs. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; to add force, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; applying to the fulfilment of the prophecy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-9.htm">Jeremiah 28:9</a>), will not fail; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, to remain behind, not to arrive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-5.htm">2 Samuel 20:5</a>).<p>(Note: The lxx have rendered &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1488; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, which the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>) has still further defined by adding the article, and, connecting it with &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a> (lxx), has taken it as Messianic, and applied to the speedy coming of the Messiah to judgment; not, however, according to the exact meaning of the words, but according to the fundamental idea of the prophetic announcement. For the vision, the certain fulfilment of which is proclaimed by Habakkuk, predicts the judgment upon the power of the world, which the Messiah will bring to completion.) </body></html>
