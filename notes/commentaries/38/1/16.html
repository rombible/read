This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - This being so, since God was so jealous for His people, so displeased with their persecutors, "thus saith the Lord," Dionysius, "I who "in wrath remember mercy, am returned" <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-2.htm">Habakkuk 3:2</a>, not by change of place, who am uncircumscribed, not existing in place, to the people of Judah and Jerusalem in mercies, manifoldly benefiting them by various effects of My love." The single benefits, the rebuilding of His House, and so the restoration of His public worship, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, are but instances of that all-containing mercy, His restored presence in tender mercies.

The prophet proceeds to lay this enigma before God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13-17</a>, and to pray for his people to be spared during the period of the Chaldaean affliction. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>. "Art Thou too pure of eye to behold evil, and canst Thou not look upon distress? Wherefore lookest Thou upon the treacherous? and art silent when the wicked devours one more righteous than he? <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14</a>. And Thou hast made men like fishes of the sea, like reptiles that have no ruler. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-15.htm">Habakkuk 1:15</a>. All of them hath he lifted up with the hook; he draws them into his net, and gathers them in his fishing net; he rejoices thereat, and is glad. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-16.htm">Habakkuk 1:16</a>. Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his landing net; for through them is his portion rich, and his food fat. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>. Shall he therefore empty his net, and always strangle nations without sparing?" In <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>, &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, with the two clauses dependent upon it, stands as a vocative, and &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; followed by &#1502;&#1503; as a comparative: purer of eyes than to be able to see. This epithet is applied to God as the pure One, whose eyes cannot bear what is morally unclean, i.e., cannot look upon evil. The purity of God is not measured here by His seeing evil, but is described as exalted above it, and not coming at all into comparison with it. On the relation in which these words stand to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a>, see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>. In the second clause the infinitive construction passes over into the finite verb, as is frequently the case; so that &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; must be supplied in thought: who canst not look upon, i.e., canst not tolerate, the distress which the wicked man prepares for others. Wherefore then lookest Thou upon treacherous ones, namely, the Chaldaeans? They are called &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, from their faithlessly deceptive and unscrupulously rapacious conduct, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>. That the seeing is a quiet observance, without interposing to punish, is evident from the parallel &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;: Thou art silent at the swallowing of the &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. The more righteous than he (the ungodly one) is not the nation of Israel as such, which, if not perfectly righteous, was relatively more righteous than the Chaldaeans. This rabbinical view is proved to be erroneous, by the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a> the prophet describes the moral depravity of Israel in the same words as those which he here applies to the conduct of the Chaldaeans. The persons intended are rather the godly portion of Israel, who have to share in the expiation of the sins of the ungodly, and suffer when they are punished (Delitzsch). This fact, that the righteous is swallowed along with the unrighteous, appears irreconcilable with the holiness of God, and suggests the inquiry, how God can possibly let this be done.<p>This strange fact is depicted still further in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14-16</a> in figures taken from the life of a fisherman. The men are like fishes, whom the Chaldaean collects together in his net, and then pays divine honour to his net, by which he has been so enriched. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not dependent upon &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, but continues the address in a simple picture, in which the imperfect with Vav convers. represents the act as the natural consequence of the silence of God: "and so Thou makest the men like fishes," etc. The point of comparison lies in the relative clause &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, "which has no ruler," which is indeed formally attached to &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474; alone, but in actual fact belongs to &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; also. "No ruler," to take the defenceless under his protection, and shelter and defend them against enemies. Then will Judah be taken prisoner and swallowed up by the Chaldaeans. God has given it helplessly up to the power of its foes, and has obviously ceased to be its king. Compare the similar lamentation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a> : "are even like those over whom Thou hast never ruled." &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;, the creeping thing, the smaller animals which exist in great multitudes, and move with great swiftness, refers here to the smaller water animals, to which the word remes is also applied in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>, and the verb ra&#770;mas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-46.htm">Leviticus 11:46</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, pointing back to the collective 'a&#770;da&#770;m, is the object, and is written first for the sake of emphasis. The form &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, instead of &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, is analogous to the hophal &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-8.htm">Nahum 2:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a>, and also to &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-7.htm">Joshua 7:7</a> : to take up out of the water (see Ges. 63, Anm. 4). &#1497;&#1490;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; from &#1490;&#1512;&#1512;, to pull, to draw together. Chakka&#770;h is the hook, cherem the net generally, mikhmereth the large fishing-net (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;), the lower part of which, when sunk, touches the bottom, whilst the upper part floats on the top of the water. These figures are not to be interpreted with such specialty as that the net and fishing net answer to the sword and bow; but the hook, the net, and the fishing net, as the things used for catching fish, refer to all the means which the Chaldaeans employ in order to subdue and destroy the nations. Luther interprets it correctly. "These hooks, nets, and fishing nets," he says, "are nothing more than his great and powerful armies, by which he gained dominion over all lands and people, and brought home to Babylon the goods, jewels, silver, and gold, interest and rent of all the world." He rejoices over the success of his enterprises, over this capture of men, and sacrifices and burns incense to his net, i.e., he attributes to the means which he has employed the honour due to God. There is no allusion in these words to the custom of the Scythians and Sauromatians, who are said by Herodotus (iv. 59, 60) to have offered sacrifices every year to a sabre, which was set up as a symbol of Mars. What the Chaldaean made into his god, is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>, namely, his own power. "He who boasts of a thing, and is glad and joyous on account of it, but does not thank the true God, makes himself into an idol, gives himself the glory, and does not rejoice in God, but in his own strength and work" (Luther). The Chaldaean sacrifices to his net, for thereby (&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, by net and yarn) his portion (chelqo&#772;) is fat, i.e., the portion of this booty which falls to him, and fat is his food  ( &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;  is a neuter substantive). The meaning is, that he thereby attains to wealth and prosperity. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a> there is appended to this the question embracing the thought: Shall he therefore, because he rejoices over his rich booty, or offers sacrifice to his net, empty his net, sc. to throw it in afresh, and proceed continually to destroy nations in so unsparing a manner? In the last clause the figure passes over into a literal address. The place of the imperfect is now taken by a periphrastic construction with the infinitive: Shall he constantly be about to slay? On this construction, see Ges. 132, 3, Anm. 1, and Ewald, 237, c. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500; is a subordinate clause appended in an adverbial sense: unsparingly, without sparing. </body></html>
