The prophet asks the meaning, and is informed that they were the ministers of Providence, sent to examine into the state of the whole earth, which they report to be quiet and tranquil. The angel hereupon intercedes for Judah and Jerusalem, which he represents to have suffered under the divine indignation seventy years. He receives a consolatory answer. The prophet is directed to proclaim, that God’s wrath against Judah was at an end; that he would cause the temple and Jerusalem to be rebuilt; and would fill the country with good, as a token and consequence of his renewed favour, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/1-7.htm" title="On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,...">Zechariah 1:7-17</a>.” — Blayney. <span class="ital">Saying, I saw, </span>&c. — That is, the word came to the prophet, <span class="ital">who said, I saw, </span>&c., or, thus recited the divine vision which had been sent him. What now follows (which extends to the end of the sixth chapter) was uttered when the people had made a great progress in the work of the temple, and were now to be excited to the new labour of fortifying Jerusalem. <span class="ital">And behold a man — </span>The prophet terms him so, according to his appearance; till, perceiving by his answer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm" title="And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.">Zechariah 1:10</a>, that he had a divine commission, he afterward gives him the respectable title of <span class="ital">the angel, </span>or messenger of Jehovah; <span class="ital">riding upon a red horse — </span>A horse of a red or bloody colour was an emblem of the slaughters of war, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-4.htm" title="And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given to him a great sword.">Revelation 6:4</a>. But the myrtle being a tree of pleasure, and an emblem of peace, therefore the red horse appearing <span class="ital">among the myrtle- trees, </span>signified that the slaughters of war were, or soon would be, repressed or restrained by a profound peace, namely, in the Persian empire, for that is here referred to: and accordingly there was a profound peace in it in the fourth, fifth, and sixth years of Darius. It is doubtful what angel or other being was represented by the figure of a man on this red horse. Some suppose Michael, whom the Prophet Daniel seems to mention as the guardian angel of the Jews, or the angel presiding, under God, over the affairs of their nation, and taking care of them. Others suppose the <span class="greekheb">λογος</span>, or Son of God, is meant; which opinion seems probable. The reason of his appearing <span class="ital">in a bottom, </span>or low place, amidst myrtles planted by the waters, is thought to have been to mark out the affliction, humiliation, and sorrow to which Judea was reduced. The myrtle flourishes best in shady and watery places. <span class="ital">Littora myrtetis lætissima, </span>says Virgil. See Calmet. <span class="ital">Behind him were red horses — </span>With riders on them, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm" title="And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.">Zechariah 1:10</a>, “who were angels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm" title="And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.">Zechariah 1:11</a>.

This represented the low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like a warrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove. Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in the midst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him were angels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others of mercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they are themselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach those humbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judea enjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled, which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only be hoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. The Lord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises of mercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of the gospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from the Father, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are to preach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. It is not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while his people are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted by fears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here are predictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after the captivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place in the church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the twenty-fourth day - Exactly five months after the building of the temple was resumed <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>, and two months after Haggai's last prophecy <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-20.htm">Haggai 2:20</a>. The series of visions, leading onward, from the first deliverance from the enemies who oppressed them, to the Coming of Christ, is given as a reward to their first whole-hearted endeavor to restore their worship of Him.

It answers to part of our January, and part of February. This is the first time that the name of a month is mentioned by any of the prophets; this prophet prophesying after the captivity in Babylon; from whence the Jews (h) say the names of months came along with the returning captives, as well as the names of angels; and we nowhere meet with them but in the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, all wrote after that time; for before they used only to say, the first, second, or third month, &amp;c.; for, as for Abib, Zif, Bul, and Ethanira, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-4.htm">Exodus 13:4</a>, they are thought to be appellatives, and not proper names; though it may be observed that the books of Kings are said by the Jews (i) to be written by Jeremiah; more likely by several prophets, and at last brought into the order in which they now stand by Ezra, according to Huetius (k); and which may be thought probable enough; and, if so, the above names may be reckoned proper names of months; and the original of them may be accounted for as before. There were two fasts appointed by the Jews in this month; one on the tenth day of it, for the death of the elders which succeeded Joshua, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-7.htm">Judges 2:7</a> and another on the twenty third, on account of the Israelites making war with the Benjaminites, in revenge of what was done to the wife of the Levite, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-1.htm">Judges 19:1</a> (l). This prophecy, and the visions following to the end of the sixth chapter, were three months after the former prophecy, or more, if that was on the first day of the eighth month; and just two months after the foundation of the temple was laid, <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-18.htm">Haggai 2:18</a>, "in the second year of Darius", &amp;c.

But they are accompanied not only by the spoken explanation of the angel, but by frequent passages introduced by the expression, “thus saith the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm" title="So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry you, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.">Zechariah 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/1-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, said the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth on Jerusalem....">Zechariah 1:16-17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm" title="For I, said the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the middle of her.">Zechariah 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; After the glory has he sent me to the nations which spoiled you: for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.">Zechariah 2:8</a>, &c.), so that the revelation as a whole may fitly be described as “the word of the Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The First Vision. <span class="ital">The horsemen among the myrtle-trees</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/1-8.htm" title="I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white....">Zechariah 1:8-17</a>. In the night time, in prophetic trance or vision, Zechariah sees, in a shady valley full of myrtle trees, a man (who is also called an angel of Jehovah and, as it would seem, Jehovah Himself) seated on a red horse, and behind him a number of other horsemen on horses of three different colours, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm" title="I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.">Zechariah 1:8</a>. Wishing to know the meaning of what he sees, the prophet turns for information to an angel beside him, whose office it is to interpret to him the visions, and who remains by him for that purpose throughout the entire series, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm" title="Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these be.">Zechariah 1:9</a>. In answer to a sign made, or an enquiry addressed to him, by this interpreting angel, the man or angel on horseback among the myrtles explains what the mission of the band of horsemen had been, and gathers from them by sign or interrogation the result of that mission, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/1-10.htm" title="And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth....">Zechariah 1:10-11</a>. Sympathising with the prophet and his people, in the disappointment which the report of the horsemen would produce—for it told that the promised tokens of returning favour to Zion were not yet apparent, the leading horseman, the Angel of Jehovah, intercedes with the Almighty on their behalf, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?">Zechariah 1:12</a>.

Thus were the people comforted by bearing God's purposes of mercy and the great future that awaited Israel. In this first vision it is revealed to Zechariah that the Gentile nations should be overthrown, and that whatever might be the present condition of the Jewish people, God's purpose of mercy toward them was unshaken and would be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">The four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat.</span> This month (called here by its Chaldean name) answered to parts of January and February. It was three months since Zechariah had been called to the prophetical office, and five since the building of the temple had been resumed at Haggai's remonstrance. Meantime Haggai had concluded his mission by uttering his final prophecies two months ago, and now Zechariah carries on the revelation. A comparison of the months in the cuneiform inscriptions with the Hebrew will be found in Schrader, 'Keilinschriften,' 379, and in Dr. Wright's note on this verse. <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord</span>.

The appeal to see and be amazed is addressed to the prophet and the people of Judah together. It is very evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a> that Jehovah Himself is speaking here, and points by anticipation to the terrible nature of the approaching work of His punitive righteousness, although &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; is written indefinitely, without any pronoun attached. Moreover, as Delitzsch and Hitzig observe, the meaning of the appeal is not, "Look round among the nations, whether any such judgment has ever occurred;" but, "Look about among the nations, for it is thence that the terrible storm will burst that is about to come upon you" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-20.htm">Jeremiah 13:20</a>). The first and ordinary view, in support of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-13.htm">Jeremiah 18:13</a>, are generally adduced, is precluded by the fact, (1) that it is not stated for what they are to look round, namely, whether anything of the kind has occurred here or there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>); (2) that the unparalleled occurrence has not been mentioned at all yet; and (3) that what they are to be astonished or terrified at is not their failure to discover an analogy, but the approaching judgment itself. The combination of the kal, ta&#770;ma&#770;h, with the hiphil of the same verb serves to strengthen it, so as to express the highest degree of amazement (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>, and Ewald, 313, c). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for, introduces the reason not only for the amazement, but also for the summons to look round. The two clauses of the second hemistich correspond to the two clauses of the first half of the verse. They are to look round, because Jehovah is about to perform a work; they are to be amazed, or terrified, because this work is an amazing or a terrible one. The participle &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; denotes that which is immediately at hand, and is used absolutely, without a pronoun. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>, &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; is the pronoun we have to supply. For it is not practicable to supply &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, or to take the participle in the sense of the third person, since God, when speaking to the people, cannot speak of Himself in the third person, and even in that case &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; could not be omitted. Hitzig's idea is still more untenable, namely, that po&#772;&#8219;al is the subject, and that po&#772;&#8219;e&#772;l is used in an intransitive sense: the work produces its effect. We must assume, as Delitzsch does, that there is a proleptical elipsis, i.e., one in which the word immediately following is omitted (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-17.htm">Zechariah 9:17</a>). The admissibility of this assumption is justified by the fact that there are other cases in which the participle is used and the pronoun omitted; and that not merely the pronoun of the third person (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-23.htm">Jeremiah 38:23</a>), but that of the second person also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-24.htm">1 Samuel 2:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-3.htm">1 Samuel 6:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-10.htm">Psalm 7:10</a>). On the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; (in your days), see the Introduction. &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, ye would not believe it if it were told you, namely, as having occurred in another place of at another time, if ye did not see it yourselves (Delitzsch and Hitzig). Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a>, where the Apostle Paul threatens the despisers of the gospel with judgment in the words of our verse. </body></html>
