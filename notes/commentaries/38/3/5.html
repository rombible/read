Guilt and corruption are great discouragements when we stand before God. By the guilt of the sins committed by us, we are liable to the justice of God; by the power of sin that dwells in us, we are hateful to the holiness of God. Even God's Israel are in danger on these accounts; but they have relief from Jesus Christ, who is made of God to us both righteousness and sanctification. Joshua, the high priest, is accused as a criminal, but is justified. When we stand before God, to minister to him, or stand up for God, we must expect to meet all the resistance Satan's subtlety and malice can give. Satan is checked by one that has conquered him, and many times silenced him. Those who belong to Christ, will find him ready to appear for them, when Satan appears most strongly against them. A converted soul is a brand plucked out of the fire by a miracle of free grace, therefore shall not be left a prey to Satan. Joshua appears as one polluted, but is purified; he represents the Israel of God, who are all as an unclean thing, till they are washed and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Israel now were free from idolatry, but there were many things amiss in them. There were spiritual enemies warring against them, more dangerous than any neighbouring nations. Christ loathed the filthiness of Joshua's garments, yet did not put him away. Thus God by his grace does with those whom he chooses to be priests to himself. The guilt of sin is taken away by pardoning mercy, and the power of it is broken by renewing grace. Thus Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood, whom he makes kings and priests to our God. Those whom Christ makes spiritual priests, are clothed with the spotless robe of his righteousness, and appear before God in that; and with the graces of his Spirit, which are ornaments to them. The righteousness of saints, both imputed and implanted, is the fine linen, clean and white, with which the bride, the Lamb's wife, is arrayed, Re 19:8. Joshua is restored to former honours and trusts. The crown of the priesthood is put on him. When the Lord designs to restore and revive religion, he stirs up prophets and people to pray for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I said, let them set a fair mitre on his head - This seems to have been purposely omitted, in order to leave something, and that, the completion of all, to be done at the intercession of the prophet. The glory and complement of the high priest's sacrificial attire was the mitre with the "holy crown upon it and the plate of prate gold, on which was graven, Holiness to the Lord" <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>; which was to "be upon" the high priest's "forehead, that he may bear the iniquity of the holy things which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; which was always to be upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord."

And I said&#8212;Here the prophet, rejoicing at the change of raiment so far made, interposes to ask for the crowning assurance that the priesthood would be fully restored, namely, the putting the miter or priestly turban on Joshua: its fair color symbolizing the official purity of the order restored. He does not command, but prays; not "Set," but "Let them set." Vulgate and Syriac version read it, "He then said," which is the easier reading; but the very difficulty of the present Hebrew reading makes it less likely to come from a modern corrector of the text.<p>angel of &#8230; Lord stood by&#8212;the Divine Angel had been sitting (the posture of a judge, Da 7:9); now He "stands" to see that Zechariah's prayer be executed, and then to give the charge (Zec 3:6, 7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And I said:</span> Zechariah takes the boldness to desire that for Joshua which might add to his veneration and authority; and he asks the thing of Christ, or rather Christ commandeth this be done. <span class="ital">Let them</span>, who minister before Christ, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">set a fair mitre; </span> a rich and beautiful ornament for the head of the high priest; not a crown, which is for royal heads, but a tire, a pontifical ensign. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So they set, </span> as they were commanded by Christ at the request of the prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And clothed him with garments; </span> all the garments which did appertain to the high priest, of which you read <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm" title="And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a turban, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and his sons, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:4</a></span>, which probably were put on, though they are not expressly mentioned here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The angel, </span> who is the Lord Christ himself, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">stood by; </span> withdrew not till all this was done. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zechariah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head,.... These are either the words of Jehovah the Father, who has all the angels at his command, and can order them to do what he pleases; always regards the intercession of Christ; is ever well pleased with his righteousness, and with his people, as clothed with it; and, where he gives grace, he gives more grace: a man clothed with Christ's righteousness is upon rising ground; he is in the way to great honour and glory: or, as some think, they are the words of the Angel of the Lord, the Messiah, continued, who willed, ordered, and commanded his ministering servants to do this, that Joshua might appear agreeably to the dignity of his office, and look great, as well as clean and neat: or rather they are the words of Zechariah the prophet; and design either the inward thoughts and secret wishes of his mind; or were an humble request of his, and was regarded; who, seeing something wanting to make Joshua a complete high priest, intercedes for it: so one saint rejoices in the restoration of another; and is so far from envying the gifts and graces of the greatest, that he wishes him more: <p>so they set a fair mitre upon his head; such as the high priest wore; on which was a plate of gold, and on it written "Holiness to the Lord"; and was an emblem of Christ being made sanctification to his people; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>. The mitre was a garment of the high priest, a sort of covering for the head, a cap or turban: it was made of linen, and is called the linen mitre, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a> and that which Joshua might have wore before, being stained and foul, it is requested that a "fair" or "clean" (l) one might be set upon his head. It consisted, as the Jewish writers say (m), of sixteen cubits or ells, which were rolled up in the form of a Turkish turban; and has its name in Hebrew from its being thus rolled up. The account Josephus (n) gives of it is, that it was <p>"a cap or bonnet wore on the head, not rising up in a point, nor encompassing the whole head, but put on little more than the middle of it; and is called "masnaempthes" (it should be "mitznephet"); and is formed in such a manner, as to look like a crown, made of a linen web, like a swath or roller; for it is many times rolled about and sewed;'' <p>and with which Jerom's account of it agrees; who says (o), <p>"the fourth sort of garment is a round cap or bonnet, such as we see painted on Ulysses, like a globe, circle, or sphere, divided in the middle, and one part set on the head: this we and the Greeks call a "tiara"; the Hebrews, "mitznephet": it has no point at top, nor does it cover the whole head to the hair, but leaves a third part of the forehead uncovered; and so bound with a lace at the back of the head, that it cannot easily fall from it: it is made of fine linen; and is so well covered with a linen cloth, (and which also Josephus takes notice of in the above place), that no traces of the needle appear without.'' <p>It hid the seams, and the deformity of them: both the high priest and the common priests wore mitres, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a> and the difference between them, according to the Jewish writers (p), seems chiefly to lie in the manner of rolling and wrapping them: the mitre of the high priest was wrapped about his head, as you roll a broken limb, roll upon roll, and did not rise up to a point, but was flat on his head; but that of the common priests consisted of various folds and rolls; which gradually rose up to a point, as a nightcap, or high crowned hat. Josephus (q) contrary to all other writers, makes the high priest to have two mitres; for he says, he had a cap like to the former, such as all the rest of the priests had, upon which another was sewed, variegated with blue, or a violet colour; which Braunius (r) thinks is a mistake of his, arising from the blue lace, with which the plate of gold, that had engraven on it Holiness to the Lord, was fastened to the mitre; or else that the place is corrupted, or has been interpolated by some other hand; since this would make the high priest to have nine garments, and not eight only; but Fortunatus Scacchus (s) takes the passage to be genuine, and argues from it for another mitre or cap, more worthy of the high priest; and which was peculiar to him, and was very curiously wrought, and on which the celestial globe was figured; and so Josephus says (t), that the cap being made of blue or hyacinth, seemed to signify heaven; for otherwise the name of God would not have been put upon it. The son of Sirach, Ecclesiasticus 45:12 speaks very highly of this covering of the high priest's head, calling it <p>"a crown of gold upon the mitre, wherein was engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour, a costly work, the desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful;'' <p>as here a fair mitre: <p>and clothed him with garments; priestly ones, suitable to his office, which were in all eight; which were the linen breeches; the coat of linen; an embroidered girdle; a robe of blue; an ephod of gold; a breastplate curiously wrought, in which were the Urim and Thummim; a mitre of fine linen, and a plate of pure gold on it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7</a> and on the day of atonement he wore the four following extraordinary garments, breeches, coat, girdle, and mitre all of linen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a> (u); all which were typical of the clothing of believers by Christ, by whom they are made priests unto God: "and clothed him with garments"; priestly robes, suitable to his office: <p>and the Angel of the Lord stood by; to see all done according to his order; and not as a mere spectator, for he was concerned in clothing him himself; and he still stood to denote his constant care of Joshua, and his regard to him, and as having something more to say to him, as follows: <p>(l)  , Sept.; "cidarim mundam", V.

The LXX. omits the word, continuing the address to the attendant. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">et dixit.</span> So the Syriac and the Targum and some few manuscripts. But the received reading is confirmed, as Dr. Alexander points out, by the change in the mood of the following verb from the imperative to the optative, "let them put," "would that they put." There is nothing incongruous in the prophet thus intervening in his own person. Thus Isaiah, in the midst of a solemn vision, gives vent to his feelings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), and St. John in the Apocalypse often mingles his own sentiments and actions with what he beheld (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-4.htm">Revelation 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mitre</span> (<span class="accented">tsaniph</span>); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cidarim.</span> This is not the same word as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>, etc. (which is <span class="accented">mitsnepheth</span>), for the official head dress of Aaron, though it is probably a synonym for it; and the prophet's wish is to see Joshua not only reinstated in his office and dignity, but found holy also. For the fair linen mitre, or tiara, was that which bore upon its front the golden plate inscribed, "Holiness unto the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>), and therefore showed that he was qualified to intercede for the people. <span class="cmt_word">Stood by.</span> The Angel of Jehovah continued standing in his place, contemplating, sanctioning, and directing what was being done. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Fifth and last strophe. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>. "What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath carved it; the molten image and the teacher of lies, that the maker of his image trusteth in him to make dumb idols? <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>. Woe to him that saith to the wood, Wake up; Awake, to the hard stone. Should it teach? Behold, it is encased in gold and silver, and there is nothing of breath in its inside. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>. But Jehovah is in His holy temple: let all the world be silent before Him." This concluding strophe does not commence, like the preceding ones, with ho&#772;i, but with the thought which prepares the way for the woe, and is attached to what goes before to strengthen the threat, all hope of help being cut off from the Chaldaean. Like all the rest of the heathen, the Chaldaean also trusted in the power of his gods. This confidence the prophet overthrows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a> : "What use is it?" equivalent to "The idol is of no use" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-10</a>). The force of this question still continues in masse&#772;kha&#770;h: "Of what use is the molten image?" Pesel is an image carved out of wood or stone; masse&#772;kha&#770;h an image cast in metal. &#1492;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1500; is the perfect, expressing a truth founded upon experience, as a fact: What profit has it ever brought? Mo&#772;reh sheqer (the teacher of lies) is not the priest or prophet of the idols, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-14.htm">Isaiah 9:14</a>; for that would not suit the following explanatory clause, in which &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (in him) points back to mo&#772;reh sheqer: "that the maker of idols trusteth in him (the teacher of lies)." Consequently the mo&#772;reh sheqer must be the idol itself; and it is so designated in contrast with the true God, the teacher in the highest sense (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-22.htm">Job 36:22</a>). The idol is a teacher of lying, inasmuch as it sustains the delusion, partly by itself and partly through its priests, that it is God, and can do what men expect from God; whereas it is nothing more than a dumb nonentity ('el&#305;&#772;l 'ille&#772;m: compare &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>). Therefore woe be to him who expects help from such lifeless wood or image of stone. &#1506;&#1509; is the block of wood shaped into an idol. Ha&#770;q&#305;&#772;tsa&#770;h, awake! sc. to my help, as men pray to the living God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is a question of astonishment at such a delusion. This is required by the following sentence: it is even encased in gold. Ta&#770;phas: generally to grasp; here to set in gold, to encase in gold plate (za&#770;ha&#770;bh is an accusative). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;: there is not at all. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, breath, the spirit of life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a> contain a concise summary of the reproaches heaped upon idolatry in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; but they are formed quite independently, without any evident allusions to that passage. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a> the contrast is drawn between the dumb lifeless idols and the living God, who is enthroned in His holy temple, i.e., not the earthly temple at Jerusalem, but the heavenly temple, or the temple as the throne of the divine glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>), as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>, whence God will appear to judge the world, and to manifest His holiness upon the earth, by the destruction of the earthly powers that rise up against Him. This thought is implied in the words, "He is in His holy temple," inasmuch as the holy temple is the palace in which He is enthroned as Lord and Ruler of the whole world, and from which He observes the conduct of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>). Therefore the whole earth, i.e., all the population of the earth, is to be still before Him, i.e., to submit silently to Him, and wait for His judgment. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, where the same command is borrowed from this passage, and referred to the expectation of judgment. &#1495;&#1505; is hardly an imper. apoc. of &#1492;&#1505;&#1492;, but an interjection, from which the verb ha&#770;sa&#770;h is formed. But if the whole earth must keep silence when He appears as Judge, it is all over with the Chaldaean also, with all his glory and might. </body></html>
