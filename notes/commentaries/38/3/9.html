Christ is not only the <span class="ital">rod out of the stem of Jesse, </span>and <span class="ital">the branch that should grow out of his roots, </span>the fruit of which is <span class="ital">excellent and comely </span>for the remnant of Israel that escape the corruption which is in the world, but the foundation of the spiritual temple laid in Zion. And it is here foretold, that when he should be brought forth, <span class="ital">seven, </span>that is, many, eyes should be upon him. “The eye of the Father was upon him, to take care of him and protect him, especially in his sufferings. The eyes of all the prophets and Old Testament saints were upon this one stone: Abraham rejoiced to see Christ’s day, and he saw it and was glad. The eyes of all believers are upon him, as the eyes of the stung Israelites were upon the brazen serpent. They look unto him and are saved.” — Henry. Or, the seven eyes upon this stone may be explained, as the eyes upon the wheels in Ezekiel’s vision: they may signify the perfection and plenitude of knowledge and wisdom which were in Jesus Christ for the good of his church, and his ever watchful care of his people: or the various gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, with which he was endued: for he hath the seven spirits of God, as well as the seven stars, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>; and <span class="ital">his eyes are as a flame of fire, </span>piercing through all disguises, and <span class="ital">searching the reins and the heart </span>of every human creature, and especially of every one that professes to be his disciple. “The <span class="ital">Branch </span>and the <span class="ital">Stone,” </span>says Dr. Dodd, “are the same; which stone hath seven eyes, because the Messiah is the searcher of hearts, whom God engraved with his engraving; as in John the evangelist, <span class="ital">him the Father sealed, </span>endowed him with those gifts, virtues, and powers of the Spirit, which the prophets had foretold should be in the Messiah, by whom, dying on the cross, <span class="ital">God removed the</span> <span class="ital">iniquity of that land in one day. </span>In a day when every man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-10.htm" title="In that day, said the LORD of hosts, shall you call every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.">Zechariah 3:10</a>) <span class="ital">called his neighbour, </span>&c., that is, when the whole world was in profound peace.” But, instead of, <span class="ital">Upon one stone shall be seven eyes, </span>Blayney reads, <span class="ital">From one stone seven fountains, </span>the word <span class="greekheb">עין</span>signifying <span class="ital">a fountain </span>as well as <span class="ital">an eye. </span>“It seems,” says he, “as if the prophet saw in his vision a stone or rock, set before Joshua, with seven fountains springing out of it, which God says were opened by himself.” There is, he thinks, here “a plain allusion to the rock which Moses smote in the wilderness, and brought waters out of it for the refreshment of the people of God; and <span class="ital">that rock, </span>St. Paul says, <span class="ital">was Christ, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>. In speaking of which transaction, the psalmist says, <span class="ital">He opened the rock and the waters gushed out, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-41.htm" title="He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.">Psalm 105:41</a> :” in which passage the same verb, <span class="greekheb">פתח</span>, is used, which in the next clause is translated, <span class="ital">I will engrave, </span>&c., which Blayney renders, <span class="ital">Behold, I open the passage thereof; </span>that is, the hole or orifice through which the fountains shall flow. Again, it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-18.htm" title="I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the middle of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.">Isaiah 41:18</a>, <span class="ital">I will open rivers in the high places, </span>where not only the same verb is used, but is followed by the same preposition as is here placed before the word rendered <span class="ital">stone. </span>And it is said chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>, <span class="ital">In that day shall there be opened a fountain </span>(the same verb being again used) <span class="ital">to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>For what purpose? <span class="ital">for sin and for uncleanness. </span>“This was spoken of the gospel times; and, in like manner, it is here said of the same, <span class="ital">And I will remove, </span>or take away, <span class="ital">the iniquity of the land in one day, </span>namely, that one day on which Christ died to put away sin by the offering of himself. There cannot, surely, remain a doubt of what is intended, nor that <span class="greekheb">עינים</span>must signify <span class="ital">fountains </span>of living waters, issuing from Christ. The living waters are the doctrines of the gospel, and the fountains, the dispensers of them, the apostles and evangelists, who are said to be <span class="ital">fellow-workers with Christ, </span>and therefore aptly represented by the companions of Joshua. The number seven is frequently used in Scripture to denote multitudes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm" title="They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.">1 Samuel 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm" title="She that has borne seven languishes: she has given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she has been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 15:9</a>, &c., &c.” It must be observed, however, that both the LXX. and the Vulgate read <span class="ital">seven eyes, </span>and not <span class="ital">seven fountains.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:6-10 All whom God calls to any office he finds fit, or makes so. The Lord will cause the sins of the believer to pass away by his sanctifying grace, and will enable him to walk in newness of life. As the promises made to David often pass into promises of the Messiah, so the promises to Joshua look forward to Christ, of whose priesthood Joshua's was a shadow. Whatever trials we pass through, whatever services we perform, our whole dependence must rest on Christ, the Branch of righteousness. He is God's servant, employed in his work, obedient to his will, devoted to his honour and glory. He is the Branch from which all our fruit must be gathered. The eye of his Father was upon him, especially in his sufferings, and when he was buried in the grave, as the foundation-stones are under ground, out of men's sight. But the prophecy rather denotes the attention paid to this precious Corner-stone. All believers, from the beginning, had looked forward to it in the types and predictions. All believers, after Christ's coming, would look to it with faith, hope, and love. Christ shall appear for all his chosen, as the high priest when before the Lord, with the names of all Israel graven in the precious stones of his breastplate. When God gave a remnant to Christ, to be brought through grace to glory, then he engraved this precious stone. By him sin shall be taken away, both the guilt and the dominion of it; he did it in one day, that day in which he suffered and died. What should terrify when sin is taken away? Then nothing can hurt, and we sit down under Christ's shadow with delight, and are sheltered by it. And gospel grace, coming with power, makes men forward to draw others to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For behold the stone, that I hare laid before Joshua - This must be an expansion of what he had said, or the ground of it, being introduced by, for. It must be something future, to be done by God Himself, since God says, "I will grave the graving thereof;" something connected with the remission of sins, which follows upon that graying. The stone, then, cannot be the stone of foundation of the material temple (Rashi). For this had long before been laid. The head-cornerstone, the completion of the building , had nothing remarkable, why God should be said to grave it. The plumbline  was not a part even of the material temple. "The stone is one stone." But to interpret it by other prophecy, one stone there is, of which God says, "Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation, he that believeth shall not make haste" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; that stone, of which our Lord reminded the Jews, "the stone which the builders refused is become the head-stone of the corner" ; "Jesus Christ Himself, the chief cornerstone, in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-21</a>.<p>On this stone had Joshua, with all those typical priests, to look, in whom alone they and all have forgiveness, whose Sacrifice their sacrifices pictured and pleaded. "It," says an old mystical Jewish book , a "is the stone of foundation, on which the earth is founded, which God Himself laid, that the world might receive blessing from it" . "The Shechinah is called the stone, through which the world subsisteth; of which it is said, 'A stone of seven eyes, and, the stone which the builders refused.'" This "stone," God says, I have laid or set before Joshua, that is, for him to consider; as He speaks to Solomon and his children, of "My commandments which I have set before you" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6</a>.<p>Rup.: "That the stone is the Lord Jesus Christ, the head cornerstone, elect, laid as a foundation; and that the seven eyes on the one stone are the sevenfold Spirit of God which rested upon Him, is or ought to be unknown to no one. For to Him "God giveth not the Spirit by measure" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>, and "in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>. This stone was rejected by people, but chosen and honored by God." Osorius: "This stone then, on which the house of God and our whole salvation resteth, is placed by God before that high priest. That is, the most holy Name of Jesus, the virtue piety and largeness of Jesus is, by the Divine Spirit, showed to the priest, that he might understand the End of the law and holiness, to whom all the actions of life and the offices of the priesthood were to be referred. In which stone was foreshown to the divine man, not the invisible strength only, but also the manifold light of the Divine Intelligence. For it follows;"<p>Upon this one stone are seven eyes - Whether they are the eyes of God, resting in loving care upon it, or whether, as the wheels in Ezekiel's vision were "full of eyes round about" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>, the eyes are pictured as on the stone itself, marking that it symbolized a being with manifold intelligence. Zechariah speaks of the eyes of "the Lord which run to and fro on the earth" <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, and John, of the "Lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, seat forth into all the earth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>. Either symbol harmonizes with the context, and is admissible in language. before and afterward, I have laid it, I will engrave the graving thereof; and so it corresponds to the "It shall grow up before Him as a tender plant" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>. But the contrast, that on one stone there are seven eyes, perhaps rather suggests that the eyes are on the stone itself, and He, the "Living Stone," is pictured with an universality of sight, whereby, with a divine knowledge, He surveys and provides for the well-being of His whole Church. It has some analogy too to the sevenfold Spirit which was to rest upon Him. . "For this stone to have seven eyes is to retain in operation the whole virtue of the Spirit of seven-fold grace. For according to the distribution of the Holy Spirit, ones receives prophecy; another, knowledge; another, miracles; another, kinds of tongues; another, interpretation of words; but no one attaineth to have all the gifts of that same Spirit. But our Creator taking on Him our infirmities, because, through the power of His Divinity, He showed that He had at once in Him all the virtues of the Holy Spirit, united beyond doubt the bright gleams of the sevenfold constellation." "None among men had together all the operations of the Holy Spirit, save the Mediator of God and man alone, whose is that same Spirit, who proceeds from the Father before all worlds."<p>Osorius: "The stone is one. For as we have in God One Spirit, one faith, one sacrament of that most pure laver, so we worship One Christ, the one only Deliverer of the human race, and Author of our righteousness and everlasting salvation; and strengthened by His guardianship, we hope for immortality and eternal glory. Who, though He be One, governs all things with ineffable wisdom. For His wisdom is aptly described by the seven eyes. For the number seven generally describes an universality of good."<p>Behold I will engrave the graving thereof - As of a costly stone. What the graving is, is not explained; but manifestly it is everything which concurs to its beauty. . "This stone is of earth, and of the power and workmanship of God." . "It signifies Him who had His birth in virgin-earth, but framed skillfully by the power of the Holy Spirit." That Precious Stone was further graven, through the providence and will of God, when Jerome: "He caused it to be wounded by the nails of the Cross and the soldier's lance, and in His passion took away the iniquity of the earth in one day, of which it is written, "This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>. Beautiful were the gifts and graces which Christ received, as Man; but beautiful beyond all beauty must be those glorious scars, with which He allowed His whole Body to be riven, that , "throughout the whole frame His love might be engraven." Ribera: "What even in the Body of the Lord can be lovelier or more lightful than those five Wounds, which He willed to retain in His immortal Being, lest the blessed should be deprived of that splendor, surpassing far the light of sun had stars?"<p>And I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day - On "one day" in the year was the typical atonement; in one day absolutely, God Himself would make the iniquity of that land to depart. "One day" is always emphatic , that things are crowded into it, which seemed too much for one day. Year by year came the day of atonement: its yearly repetition showed that nothing lasting was effected. On "one day" that removal should be, which needed no renewal . A Jewish writer confessed the mystery, while he said, (Rashi), "One day; I know not what that day is." Ask any Christian child, "On what day was iniquity removed, not from the land only, but from all lands?" he would say, "On the day when Jesus died." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. For&#8212;expressing the ground for encouragement to the Jews in building the temple: I (Jehovah) have laid the (foundation) stone as the chief architect, before (in the presence of) Joshua, by "the hand of Zerubbabel" (Zec 4:10; Ezr 3:8-13), so that your labor in building shall not be vain. Antitypically, the (foundation) stone alluded to is Christ, before called "the Branch." Lest any should think from that term that His kingdom is weak, He now calls it "the stone," because of its solidity and strength whereby it is to be the foundation of the Church, and shall crush all the world kingdoms (Ps 118:22; compare Isa 28:16; Da 2:45; Mt 21:42; 1Co 3:11; 1Pe 2:6, 7). The angel pointing to the chief stone lying before Him, intimates that a deeper mystery than the material temple is symbolized. Moore thinks the "stone" is the Jewish Church, which Jehovah engages watchfully to guard. The temple, rather, is that symbolically. But the antitype of the foundation-stone is Messiah.<p>upon one stone shall be seven eyes&#8212;namely, the watchful "eyes" of Jehovah's care ever fixed "upon" it (Zec 4:10) [Maurer]. The eye is the symbol of Providence: "seven," of perfection (Re 5:6; compare 2Ch 16:9; Ps 32:8). Antitypically, "the seven eyes upon the stone" are the eyes of all angels (1Ti 3:16), and of all saints (Joh 3:14, 15; 12:32), and of the patriarchs and prophets (Joh 8:56; 1Pe 1:10, 11), fixed on Christ; above all, the eyes of the Father ever rest with delight on Him. Calvin (perhaps better) considers the seven eyes to be carved on the stone, that is, not the eyes of the Father and of angels and saints ever fixed on Him, but His own sevenfold (perfect) fullness of grace, and of gifts of the Spirit (Isa 11:2, 3; Joh 1:16; 3:34; Col 1:19; 2:9), and His watchful providence now for the Jews in building the temple, and always for His Church, His spiritual temple. Thus the "stone" is not as other stones senseless, but living and full of eyes of perfect intelligence (1Pe 2:4, "a living stone"), who not only attracts the eyes (Joh 12:32) of His people, but emits illumination so as to direct them to Him.<p>engrave &#8230; graving&#8212;implying Messiah's exceeding beauty and preciousness; alluding to the polished stones of the temple: Christ excelled them, as much as God who "prepared His body" (Heb 10:5; compare Joh 2:21) is superior to all human builders.<p>remove &#8230; iniquity of that land in one day&#8212;that is, the iniquity and its consequences, namely the punishment to which the Jews heretofore had been subjected (Hag 1:6, 9-11). The remission of sin is the fountain of every other blessing. The "one day" of its removal is primarily the day of national atonement celebrated after the completion of the temple (Le 23:27) on the tenth day of the seventh month. Antitypically, the atonement by Messiah for all men, once for all ("one day") offered, needing no repetition like the Mosaic sacrifices (Heb 10:10, 12, 14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here is an ellipsis, and to make it up we must repeat that of the 8th verse, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hear now, </span>& c. For behold, (pointing to a particular stone,) that stone which I have laid, saith God, in the sight of Joshua, or which he saw laid in the building of the temple; on that one stone are seven eyes; and Joshua and his fellows are commanded to observe it, the meaning of which the angel will suggest to them presently. It is not improbable this one stone might be a corner-stone, and a principal corner-stone, and the eyes engraven on it so placed that they might look many ways; so it will be a more exact emblem of Christ the chief Cornerstone, and of his perfect knowledge and wisdom, fitting him to govern his church and provide for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will engrave the graving; </span> the engraving engraved, i.e. most artificially, lively, and with excellent contrivance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And I will remove; </span> or, and I have removed, I have pardoned the iniquity of this land at once. Thus the emblem or type, which I shall once more set before you in plainer words than those of our version. Hear now, O Joshua, thou and thy fellows, for behold there is one stone, and on that stone seven eyes, most curiously engraved, and this laid in thy sight, and in the sight of thy fellows: this learn by it, that the temple, founded on such a corner-stone, built by the wisdom of the chief Builder, guarded and watched over by all-seeing Providence, is the blessing and honour of that people, whose sins are all forgiven. The further spiritual meaning discovers the Messiah the chief Corner-stone, the gospel church founded thereon, guided by perfect wisdom, and preserved by never-erring Providence, and blest with the pardon of all her sins, taken away in one day, by the meritorious death of her Redeemer. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zechariah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For, behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua,.... Not the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; nor the first and foundation stone of the temple laid by him in the presence of Joshua; but Christ the Stone of Israel, whom the builders refused, the foundation and corner stone of the spiritual building the church: and this was laid before Joshua to build his faith upon, to view his safety and security on it, and to take comfort from it for himself; and to lay it before others, and instruct them in the nature and use of it, for their comfort also. It was prophetically laid before him in the prophecies of Christ, that went before; and typically, when the foundation of the temple was laid, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-9.htm">Ezra 3:9</a> the temple being a type of the church, and the foundation of it a type of Christ: and this being done by Jehovah, shows that he is the chief builder; that this stone must be an excellent one, that is of his laying; that that building must stand, which this is the foundation of; and that under builders have great encouragement to work; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>. Vitringa, on the place referred to, interprets Joshua of Isaiah, who prophesied of this stone in the said place, and before whom it was laid by a spirit of prophecy; Isaiah and Joshua being words of the same signification and formation: but Isaiah was no high priest; for there is no room to think that Joshua, in this verse, is another and distinct from Joshua the high priest, in the former: <p>upon one stone shall be seven eyes; meaning either the eyes of Christ himself, which he has, and are in him; for Christ is not only a Living Stone, but a seeing one, even all seeing; he is all eye. This may be an allusion to such stones that have the resemblance of eyes upon them: such a stone is that which Scheuchzer (d) speaks of, and calls "siliculus ommatias", being found in the river Sila; which represents the fore part of the bulb of the eye, and the black pupil of the eye in a snowy white; and, after a small interstice, as surrounded with another black circle; with which may be compared the "achates", in the middle of which is an onyx, resembling an eye, and is therefore named by Velschius (e), "achates ommatias", and "onych ophthalmos". Some stones have on them the figures of the eyes of animals, and have their names from them; as the "oegophthalmos", which is very much like the eye of a goat; and "lycophthalmos", in the middle of which the black is surrounded with white, as the eyes of wolves, and in all respects like unto them; and "hyophthalmos", which bears the likeness of the eyes of swine: and some resemble human eyes; there is one called "triophthalmos", which is bred with the onyx, and represents three eyes of a man together; all which are made mention of by Pliny (f): but here is a stone with seven eyes in it, denoting perfection of sight in him as a divine Person, special oversight of his people, and fulness of grace in him as Mediator; for the fulness of the gifts and graces of the Spirit in him, for the use of his people, is signified by seven eyes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a> they may design the omniscience of Christ in general, which reaches to all persons and things, and greatly qualifies him to be the Head of the church, and Judge of the world; and likewise his special knowledge, care, and watchfulness of his own people, from everlasting, in time, at, and before, and after conversion, under all their trials and exercises: or they design the eyes which are looking to him, and are intent on him; and the sense is, that all eyes are upon him: the eyes of God the Father were upon him in the council and covenant of peace, and under the Old Testament, as the surety of his people, to make satisfaction for them; and, when the fulness of time was come, to send him forth; and during his infancy, and throughout his life, to preserve him; and in the whole of his humiliation, sufferings, and death, his eye was on him with pleasure and satisfaction; and when in the grave to raise him up; and now in heaven, for the acceptance of his people: the eyes of the Holy Spirit are on him, to take of his things, and show them to his people: the eyes of angels are upon him, in point of dependence, service, and worship; their eyes were upon him when here on earth, as he ascended to heaven, and now he is there; the eyes of all the saints, under the Old Testament, were upon him, expecting him, and looking to his person, and to his blood and sacrifice, that were to be offered; the eyes of all believers, under the New Testament, in all times and places, are to him for pardon, righteousness, life, and salvation; and the eyes of all, good and bad, will be fastened on him, when he comes a second time, in the clouds of heaven; and the eyes of all the glorified ones will be upon him to all eternity, beholding his glory; to this sense agrees the Targum, which renders the words, "upon one stone, seven eyes look to it". R. Joseph Kimchi interprets these eyes of seven men, Joshua, Ezra, Zerubbabel, Nehemiah, and the three prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi: <p>behold, I will engrave the engraving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts: either with the names of his elect, which are not only written in the book of the Lamb; but their persons are put into his hands, and engraven there; and are bore upon his shoulders, he having the care and government of them; and are upon his breastplate, and on his heart, he being their representative, and presenting them for a memorial before the Lord; as the names of the tribes of Israel were on the stones, on the shoulders, and on the breastplate of the high priest; in all which Jehovah is concerned: or else with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, like a carved or polished stone; his human body was prepared and formed by him, and his human soul was filled with him; and he, as Mediator, was full of grace and truth; which is one branch of his glory, and draws the eyes of believers to him: or these engravings may intend the sufferings of Christ; the wounds and marks in his flesh; or, the "openings" (g), in his feet, hands, and side, as it may be rendered; the incisions and cuts made there by the nails and spear; which were according to the determination, will, and pleasure of God; according to his purposing and commanding will, which Christ was obedient to; and are pleasing to God, as being the accomplishment of his counsel and covenant; satisfactory to his law and justice; what procured the salvation of his people, and brought glory to him: unless this is rather to be understood of the exaltation and glorification of his human nature in heaven; of his being beautified, adorned, and crowned with glory and honour there, and made the head stone of the corner; and indeed all these things may be included. The allusion seems to be to engraving of stones, either by nature, or by art; some have forms and figures on them, which are not engraven by art, or man's device, but are of God, and by nature; such as those stones before mentioned, that have the resemblance of eyes upon them; and the "achates", which was wore in the ring of Pyrrhus king of Epirus, in which were seen the nine Muses, and Apollo holding a harp; and which were not engraven by art, as Pliny (h) observes; but the spots of nature's own accord were so placed, as that to each Muse its proper ensign was given: others are engraven by the art of men, as the onyx stones, which had the names of the children of Israel on them, wore on the shoulders of the high priest; by which instance it appears, that the art of engraving on precious stones is very ancient, and in which the ancients are said to excel; their engravings on agates, cornelians, and onyx, surpass anything of that kind produced by the moderns. Pyrgoteles, in the times of Alexander, and Dioscorides, under the first Roman emperors, were the most eminent engravers we read of. This art, with other polite arts, was buried under the ruins of the Roman empire, until it was retrieved in Italy at the beginning of the fifteenth century, by two Italians; and from that time has been common enough in Europe (i): but since this stone here was for building, rather the allusion is to the engraving and polishing of corner stones and frontispieces in edifices; and particularly to those costly, curious, and carved stones used and laid in the temple; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-1.htm">Mark 13:1</a> or to the first stone laid in the foundation, in which little orbs were engraven, and medals of gold or silver put in them, bearing the name, country, and descent of the builder, and the day, year, and reign in which the structure was begun; which little orbs are thought to be called eyes, because of the orbicular form of the eye (k): so Grotius thinks the engraving of the seven eyes on the stone is here referred to; which stone he takes to be the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, when the foundation of the temple was laid, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a> at which time these seven eyes were caused suddenly to appear on it, and is the wonder spoken of, <a href="http://www.bibleapps.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>, <p>and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day; not Judea, nor Chaldea, but Immanuel's land, the church and people of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a> even all the elect and covenant ones, for whom Christ suffered and died, and who are laid upon this stone; their sins Jehovah removed from them to Christ their surety; and Christ, by bearing them, and the punishment of them, took them away; and God removed them, both from him and them, upon his becoming a sacrifice for them; and that wholly out of sight, so as that he never will impute them to them, nor condemn them for them; and this was all done "in one day". Jarchi, upon the text, says, <p>"I know not what day this is;'' <p>but we Christians know it was the day on which Christ suffered and died, and offered himself a sacrifice for sin; by which one offering of himself, once for all, he put away sin for ever; it was all done in one day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a> on the day he suffered, when he, expiring on the cross, said, "it is finished"; namely, sin, and complete salvation from it. <p>(d) Specimen.

V. The primary and immediate reference is to the Temple, in re-building which Joshua was then engaged. The “stone,” which was perhaps seen lying before him in the vision, is most probably not the foundation-stone, which had been laid years before, but the head-stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm" title="Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace to it.">Zechariah 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm" title="The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.">Zechariah 4:9</a>), which would complete the building, and which He, with whom to purpose is to accomplish, here announces that He has already laid; so certainly shall it be set in its place in due time. The ultimate reference is to Him, who as “the Branch” should hereafter “build the temple of the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>), of which He is not only the Foundation-stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,...">1 Peter 2:4-5</a>), but also the chief corner-stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm" title="The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.">Psalm 118:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>). The two fulfilments of the prophecy are intimately connected. The first is, in the purpose of God, the necessary preparation for the second.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon one stone shall be seven eyes</span>] <span class="bld">are,</span> R. V. This may mean that seven eyes shall be, or are, sculptured upon the stone; though in that case it is difficult to understand the force of the word “<span class="ital">one</span>,” or the significance of the prediction as regards the Temple then in progress. Typically, the seven eyes sculptured on the stone might be held to represent Him whom the stone symbolises, as “<span class="ital">having</span> the seven spirits of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>). It is better, however, to understand the words to be a promise that the seven eyes (i.e. the perfect watchfulness and care—seven being the number of perfection) of God shall be fixed upon this stone; that He will never, so to speak, take His eyes off either type or anti-type, till His purpose respecting them is accomplished. So Solomon prays, at the dedication of the first Temple, that God’s “eyes may be open upon it night and day,” to hear the prayers that are offered there. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm" title="That your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall be there: that you may listen to the prayer which your servant shall make toward this place.">1 Kings 8:29</a>. This view is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm" title="For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:10</a>, where the eyes of Jehovah are said to rejoice when (fixed as we are here told in unwearying solicitude on the Temple) they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, as he busies himself in its restoration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will engrave the graving thereof</span>] Supposing the eyes to have been marked out for cutting upon the stone, some have thought that God in these words engages that He Himself will cut them there. This clause, however, is rather to be regarded as an additional promise. My eyes, I have said, are fixed upon the stone. My hand shall engrave upon it whatever is needed to beautify and fit it for the place of honour it is to hold. The word here used for “engrave” occurs three times in Exodus 28, in the expression “engravings of a signet;” twice of the jewels in the High Priest’s dress (11, 21), once of the golden plate on his mitre (36). It is used, however, of a bolder kind of engraving, more like what would here be contemplated, of “cherubim, lions and palm trees,” on the panels of the “bases,” on which the lavers were set in Solomon’s Temple. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-36.htm" title="For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.">1 Kings 7:36</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in one day</span>] It is possible that the renewal of the typical expiation of sin in “one day,” the Day of Atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-21.htm" title="And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:">Leviticus 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-30.htm" title="For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.">Leviticus 16:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-34.htm" title="And this shall be an everlasting statute to you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.">Leviticus 16:34</a>), consequent upon the re-building of the Temple and the resumption of its services, is here glanced at. But the goal of the prophecy is “the day of Golgotha.” “A Jewish writer confessed the mystery while he said, ‘<span class="ital">One day</span>, I know not what that day is.’ Ask any Christian child, ‘On what day was iniquity removed, not from the land only, but from all lands?’ He would say, ‘On the day when Jesus died.’ ” Pusey.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For behold.</span> This gives the reason why the "Branch" is brought forth; the Church is to be firmly established and all iniquity to be abolished. <span class="cmt_word">The stone that I have laid</span> (set) <span class="cmt_word">before Joshua.</span> In the vision a stone is seen lying at the feet of Joshua, either the foundationstone of the temple, say the commentators, or the cornerstone, or the coping; or, as the Talmud testifies, a stone that rose some three fingers' measure above the ground, and upon which the high priest used to set the censer of incense. But it was more probably none of these, but some rough, unhewed block, not yet polished or fitted into its place. What does it represent? Many critics of note answer at once, the Messiah. He who was above called "Branch" is now called the "Stone." And certainly this term in applied unto him in prophetical language, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>; and references are made to the appellation is the New Testament as to a well known title, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>. But there are objections to taking this as the primary sense. As Knabenbauer points out, it is not likely that in one verse the Lord's Servant Branch is said to be destined to be brought forth, and in the next the same is called the stone which is set before Joshua and has to be graven by a hand Divine. Besides, if both terms mean Messiah, we have the very lame conclusion: I will bring Messiah because I have already placed him before Joshua. The stone, too, is represented as somewhat under the management of Joshua, and needing graving and polishing, neither of which facts apply to the Messiah. Putting out of sight other interpretations which are all more or less inadmissible, we shall be safest in considering the stone to represent the theocracy, the spiritual kingdom of Israel, now indeed lying imperfect and unpolished before Joshua, but ordained to become beautiful and extensive and admirable. So Daniel (Daniel 2:35, 45) speaks of the stone cut out of the mountains without hands, which filled the whole earth, a figure of the Church and kingdom of God, small in its beginning, but in the end establishing its rule over the world. <span class="cmt_word">Upon one stone;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "upon the one stone." The stone is termed "one" in contrast with the number seven that follows. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be</span> (are) <span class="cmt_word">seven eyes.</span> Upon this stone the eyes of God are directed in watchful care (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; and for the phrase, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a>). "Seven" is the number of perfection, and may denote here the infinite care which God takes of his Church, even as St. John in the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>) beheld the Lamb "having seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth." The expression is metaphorical, and we are not to suppose, with Ewald, that the eyes were graven on the stone, or that Zechariah derived his notion from the tenets of Zoroaster or the degrees of rank in the Persian court. There may be an allusion to the seven gifts of the Spirit with which Messiah is anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>), and which animate and strengthen his body, the Church. <span class="cmt_word">I will engrave the graving thereof.</span> As God engraved the tables of the Law  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>). I will out and polish this rough stone to fit it for its place in the temple. The verb is used of the bold engraving and ornamentation of stonework, the finishing which it undergoes to perfect its preparation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-7.htm">2 Chronicles 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-7.htm">2 Chronicles 3:7</a>). Those who regard the stone as typifying the Messiah, see in this clause an intimation of the Passion of Christ, who "was wounded for our transgressions." The LXX. has, "I dig a trench," which Jerome explains of the wounds of Christ on the cross. <span class="cmt_word">I will remove the iniquity of that land.</span> The shaping of the stone involves the bestowal of purity and holiness. God will pardon the inhabitants of the land of Israel, and make them a holy nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-7.htm">Jeremiah 33:7, 8</a>). But the promise stretches far beyond the limits primarily assigned to it. <span class="cmt_word">In one day.</span> The day when Christ died for the sins of men. There is an allusion to the great Day of Atonement, when the high priest went once a year into the holy of holies with the blood of sacrifice. This, however, was an imperfect reconciliation, and had to be repeated annually. "But Christ being come an High Priest of the good things to come...  through his own blood entered in once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption Now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-26</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A splendour shines or arises like the light. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not point back to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;, "splendour like the sun will His glory be" (Hitzig); but it is the predicate to no&#772;gah in the sense of to become, or to arise. &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is the light of the sun. Like this light, or like the rising sun, when the Lord comes, there arises (spreads) a brilliant light, from which the rays emanate on its two sides. &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, according to &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-30</a>, is to be taken in the sense of rays; and this meaning has developed itself from a comparison of the first rays of the rising sun, which shoot out above the horizon, to the horns or antlers of the gazelle, which is met with in the Arabian poets. &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;, from His hand, i.e., since the hand is by the side, "at His side" (after the analogy of &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493;), and indeed "His hand" in a general sense, as signifying the hand generally, and not one single hand, equivalent therefore to "on both sides" (Delitzsch). As the disc of the sun is surrounded by a splendid radiance, so the coming of God is enclosed by rays on both sides. &#1500;&#1493; refers to God. "Such a radiant splendour (&#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;) surrounding God is presupposed when it is affirmed of Moses, that on coming from the presence of Jehovah his face was radiant, or emitted rays" (&#1511;&#1512;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-30</a>). This interpretation of the words is established beyond all doubt, not only by the &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; of the original passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, but also by the expressions which follow in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>, viz., &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; (before him) and &#1500;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1493; (behind him); and consequently the interpretation "rays (emanating) from His hand are to Him," with the idea that we are to think of flashes of lightning darting out of God's hand (Schnur., Ros., Hitzig, Maurer, etc.), is proved to be untenable. According to Hebrew notions, flashes of lightning do not proceed from the hand of God (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, which has been appealed to in support of this explanation, we have &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;); and &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; does not occur either in Arabic or the later Hebrew in the sense of flashes of lightning, but only in the sense of the sun's rays. &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, and there - namely, in the sun-like splendour, with the rays emanating from it - is the hiding of His omnipotence, i.e., the place where His omnipotence hides itself; in actual fact, the splendour forms the covering of the Almighty God at His coming, the manifestation of the essentially invisible God. The cloudy darkness is generally represented as the covering of the glory of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>), not merely when His coming is depicted under the earthly substratum of a storm (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12-13</a>), but also when God was manifested in the pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) on the journey of the Israelites through the desert, where it was only by night that the cloud had the appearance of fire (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-16</a>). Here, on the contrary, the idea of the splendour of the rising sun predominates, according to which light is the garment in which God clothes Himself (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>), answering to His coming as the Holy One (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a>). For the sun-light, in its self-illumining splendour, is the most suitable earthly element to serve as a symbol of the spotless purity of the Holy One, in whom there is no variation of light and darkness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The alteration of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; into &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; (he provides or contrives the concealment of His power), which Hitzig proposes after the lxx (Aq., Symm., and Syr.), must be rejected, inasmuch as in that case the object, which he makes into the covering (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>), could not be omitted; and this thought is by no means suitable here, and has merely been brought into the text on the assumption that God appears in a storm. As the Holy One, God comes to judgment upon the unholy world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>). Before Him goes debher, plague, and after His feet, i.e., behind Him, resheph, lit., burning heat, or a blaze (Sol 8:6), here the burning heat of the pestilence, fever-heat, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>. Plague and pestilence, as proceeding from God, are personified and represented as satellites; the former going before Him, as it were, as a shield-bearer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>), or courier (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>); the latter coming after Him as a servant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-42.htm">1 Samuel 25:42</a>). This verse prepares the way for the description, which commences with <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, of the impression produced by the coming of God upon the world and its inhabitants. </body></html>
