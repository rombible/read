The promise of future plenty made in the preceding verse, with which this appears to be closely connected, suggested the mentioning the means by which it might be procured. As if he had said, The fulfilling of the promise of fruitful seasons depends on the people’s asking them of God, who will hear their petitions if offered to him with sincerity and fervour, and will give them both the former and the latter rain in its season.

Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we may ask of God when there is most need of it, and we may look for it to come. We must in our prayers ask for mercies in their proper time. The Lord would make bright clouds, and give showers of rain. This may be an exhortation to seek the influences of the Holy Spirit, in faith and by prayer, through which the blessings held forth in the promises are obtained and enjoyed. The prophet shows the folly of making addresses to idols, as their fathers had done. The Lord visited the remnant of his flock in mercy, and was about to renew their courage and strength for conflict and victory. Every creature is to us what God makes it to be. Every one raised to support the nation, as a corner-stone does the building, or to unite those that differ, as nails join the different timbers, must come from the Lord; and those employed to overcome their enemies, must have strength and success from him. This may be applied to Christ; to him we must look to raise up persons to unite, support, and defend his people.

Zechariah had promised in God's name blessings temporal and spiritual: all was ready on God's part; only, he adds, ask them of the Lord, the Unchangeable, the Self-same not of Teraphim or of diviner, as Israel had done aforetime <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-5.htm">Isaiah 2:5-22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15-28</a>. He had promised, "If ye shall hearken diligently unto My coramandments, to love the Lord your God, I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, and I will send grass in thy field for thy cattle" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-15</a>. God bids them ask Him to fulfill His promise. The "latter rain"  alone is mentioned, as completing what God had begun by the former rain, filling the ears before the harvest. Both  had been used as symbols of God's spiritual gifts, and so the words fit in with the close of the last chapter, both as to things temporal and eternal. Osorius: "He exhorts all frequently to ask for the dew of the divine grace, that what had sprung up in the heart from the seed of the word of God, might attain to full ripeness."<p>The Lord maketh bright clouds - (Rather) "lightnings, into rain," as Jeremiah says, "He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings into rain" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-16.htm">Jeremiah 51:16</a>; and the Psalmist, "He maketh lightnings into rain" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>, disappearing as it were into the rain which follows on them. "And giveth them." While man is asking, God is answering. "Showers of rain" , "rain in torrents," as we should say, or "in floods," or, inverted, "floods of rain." "To every one grass," rather, "the green herb, in the field," as the Psalmist says, "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>, see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm">Genesis 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). This He did with individual care, as each had need, or as should be best for each, as contrariwise He says in Amos, "I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon, and the piece, whereon it rained not, withered" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-7.htm">Amos 4:7</a>; see note).<p>The Rabbis observed these exceptions to God's general law, whereby He "sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-49.htm">Matthew 5:49</a>, though expressing it in their way hyperbolically; , "In the time when Israel doeth the will of God, He doeth their will; so that if one man alone, and not the others, wants rain, He will give rain to that one man; and if a man wants one herb alone in his field or garden, and not another, He will give rain to that one herb; as one of the saints used to say, This plot of ground wants rain, and that plot of ground wants not rain" (Cyril). Spiritually the rain is divine doctrine bedewing the mind and making it fruitful, as the rain doth the earth. So Moses saith, "My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>.

Prayer and Promise.<p>Call to prayer to Jehovah, as contrasted with the idol-worship which had brought judgments on the princes and people.

Though God has begun to bless us, we are not to relax our prayers. The former rain of conversion may have been given, but we must also ask for the latter rain of ripened sanctification. Though at Pentecost there was a former rain on the Jewish Church, a latter rain is still to be looked for, when the full harvest of the nation's conversion shall be gathered in to God. The spirit of prayer in the Church is an index at once of her piety, and of the spiritual blessings she may expect from God. When the Church is full of prayer, God pours out a full blessing.<p>bright clouds&#8212;rather, "lightnings," the precursors of rain [Maurer].<p>showers of rain&#8212;literally, "rain of heavy rain."

There was the former and the latter rain, of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>. The former rain was in autumn, a little before or about seed time; the latter was in the spring, and a little before harvest, which is here referred to. So Hesiod (g) calls those rains the autumnal and vernal rains; and between these two rains there was seldom any more. Jerom says (h) that he never saw in the eastern countries, especially in Judea, any rain at the end of the month of June, or in July; and now, at Aleppo, a little more northerly, for three or four months after May, they have scarce so much as any dew upon the ground, as Pemble on the place observes. So Dr. Shaw says (i), little or no rain falls in this climate (of Algiers and Tunis), during the summer season; and in most parts of the Sahara, particularly in the Jereede, they have seldom any rain at all. It was likewise the same in the holy land, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-1.htm">Proverbs 26:1</a> where rain is accounted an unusual thing in "harvest", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a> where it is also mentioned, "from harvest till rain dropped on them"; i.e. their rainy season fell out, as in Barbary, in the autumnal and winter months. <p>"The first rains (he observes) fall here some years in September, in others a month later; after which the Arabs break up their ground, in order to sow wheat, and plant beans: this commonly falls out about the middle of October.'' <p>If the latter rains fall as usual in the middle of April, (in the holy land we find they were a month sooner, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>.) the crop is reckoned secure; the harvest coming on in the latter end of May, or in the beginning of June, according to the heat and quality of the preceding seasons: wherefore, since there was so little rain fell in these countries, and particularly in Judea; if these former and latter rains failed, a scarcity followed; for, for want of the former rain, the earth was hard, and not easily ploughed up; and for want of the latter the grain withered away in the blade, and did not ear, at least did not produce ears plump and good; so that these rains were great temporal blessings, and to be asked for, as they were by the Jews, when they were wanted; and for which they appointed fasts (k), and were emblems of spiritual blessings here designed; for rain here is not to be literally understood, but mystically and spiritually; and designs either the love and favour of God, and the comfortable discoveries of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a> which may be compared to rain in its original; it is from above, from on high, it comes from heaven; it is not owing to anything in man, but to the will of God; and is distinguishing, as rain falls on one city, and not on another; in its objects, undeserving persons, as rain is sent on the just and unjust; in its manner of communication, it tarries not for the will and works of men; it comes at times in great abundance, and the discoveries of it are to be asked for; in its effects, it softens and melts the heart into evangelical repentance; it cools and extinguishes the flaming wrath of a fiery law in the conscience; it refreshes and revives the drooping spirit, and makes the barren soul fruitful: or the blessings of grace in general may be meant; these are from above, depend on the will of God; are to be sought after, and asked for; are free grace gifts; are given largely and plentifully, and make fruitful: or the coming of Christ in the flesh in particular is intended; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a> who came down from heaven; is a free gift of God to men, was sought after, and greatly desired, and to be desired, by the Old Testament saints, and very grateful to such when he came. This may also be applied to his spiritual coming in his power and kingdom in the latter day, which is to be earnestly wished and prayed for, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a> or else the Gospel may be designed; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a> this is of God, and from above; comes and falls upon the sons of men, according to divine direction; softens hard hearts, when it becomes effectual; comforts the souls of God's people; is a blessing to be desired, and asked for; and will be enjoyed in great plenty in the latter day: <p>so the Lord shall make bright clouds; by which may be meant the ministers of the Gospel, who are of God's making, and not man's: these may be compared to "clouds" for their number, especially as they will be in the latter day; and for their moving to and fro, to communicate spiritual knowledge: and to "bright" ones, such as from whence lightning springs, thunderclouds, full of water; (the same word is used for lightning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25</a>;) because full of Gospel truths, and because of that clear light they diffuse to others: <p>and give them showers of rain: productive, under a divine influence, of large conversions among Jews and Gentiles: <p>to everyone grass in the field: on whom these showers fall with efficacy, and a divine blessing; everyone of these have a spiritual knowledge of Christ, faith in him, repentance towards God, food and fulness of it; and are filled with the fruits of righteousness, or good works, to the glory of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>.

"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Ask now the priests for instruction, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>. Behold, one carries holy flesh in the lappet of his garment, and touches with his lappet the bread, and that which is boiled, the wine, and the oil, and any kind of food: does it then become holy? And the priests answered and said, No. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>.

Then Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so this nation before my face, is the saying of Jehovah; and so is all the work of their hands, and what they offer to me there: it is unclean." In order to impress most earnestly upon the hearts of the people the fact that it was through their sin that they brought upon themselves the failure of crops that had hitherto prevailed, viz., as a punishment from God, the prophet proposes two questions concerning holy and clean for the priests to answer, in order that he may make an application of the answer they give to the moral condition of the nation.

He&#772;n, behold, pointing to an action as possible, has almost the force of a conditional particle, "if," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-15.htm">Isaiah 54:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1</a> (cf. Ewald, 103, g). "Holy flesh" is flesh of animals slain as sacrifices, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a>. Na&#770;z&#305;&#772;d, that which is boiled, boiled food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>.). The priests answer the question laid before them quite correctly with "No;" for, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>, the lappet of the dress itself was made holy by the holy flesh, but it could not communicate this holiness any further. The second question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>) has reference to the spread of legal defilement. &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is not one who is unclean in his soul; but, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-4.htm">Leviticus 22:4</a> shows, it is synonymous with &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-10.htm">Numbers 9:10</a>, "defiled on a soul;" and this is a contraction of &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1512; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, or &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1514;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6-7</a>, "defiled on (through) the soul of a dead man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-6.htm">Numbers 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> : see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), hence one who has been defiled through touching a dead body. This uncleanness was one of the strongest kinds; it lasted seven days, and could only be removed by his being twice purified with sprinkling water, prepared from the ashes of the red cow (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>). This question the priests also answered correctly. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>, he who was defiled by touching a dead body made everything unclean that he touched. The prophet now applies these provisions of the law to the ethical relation in which the people stood to Jehovah. "So is this people before me, saith Jehovah." &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; is quite synonymous with &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>, without any subordinate meaning of a contemptuous kind, which could at the most be contained in hazzeh (this), but in that case would apply to ha&#770;&#8219;a&#770;m just as well. Ke&#772;n, ita, refers to the substance of the two legal questions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13</a>. The nation, in its attitude towards the Lord, resembles, on the one hand, a man who carries holy flesh in the lappet of his garment, and on the other hand, a man who has become unclean through touching a corpse. "Israel also possesses a sanctuary in the midst of its land, - namely, the place which Jehovah has chosen for His own abode, and favoured with many glorious promises. But just as no kind of food, neither bread nor vegetables, neither wine nor oil, is sanctified by the fact that a man touches it with his sanctified garment, so will all this not be rendered holy by the fact that it is planted in the soil of the land which surrounds and encloses the sanctuary of Jehovah. For though the land itself becomes a holy land in consequence, it cannot spread this holiness any further, nor communicate it to what grows upon it. All that Israel raises on its holy land, whether corn, wine, or oil, remains unholy or common. No special blessing rests upon the fruits of this land, on account of the holiness of the land itself, so as of necessity to produce fruitfulness as its result; nor, on the other hand, does it in itself communicate any curse. But if, as experience shows, a curse is resting notwithstanding upon the productions of this land, it arises from the fact that they are unclean because Israel has planted them. For Israel it utterly unclean on account of its neglect of the house of Jehovah, like a man who has become unclean through touching a corpse. Everything that Israel takes hold of, or upon which it lays its hand, everything that it plants and cultivates, is from the very first affected with the curse of uncleanness; and consequently even the sacrifices which it offers there upon the altar of Jehovah are unclean" (Koehler). Sha&#770;m, there, i.e., upon the altar built immediately after the return from Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-3.htm">Ezra 3:3</a>). </body></html>
