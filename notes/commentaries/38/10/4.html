Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we may ask of God when there is most need of it, and we may look for it to come. We must in our prayers ask for mercies in their proper time. The Lord would make bright clouds, and give showers of rain. This may be an exhortation to seek the influences of the Holy Spirit, in faith and by prayer, through which the blessings held forth in the promises are obtained and enjoyed. The prophet shows the folly of making addresses to idols, as their fathers had done. The Lord visited the remnant of his flock in mercy, and was about to renew their courage and strength for conflict and victory. Every creature is to us what God makes it to be. Every one raised to support the nation, as a corner-stone does the building, or to unite those that differ, as nails join the different timbers, must come from the Lord; and those employed to overcome their enemies, must have strength and success from him. This may be applied to Christ; to him we must look to raise up persons to unite, support, and defend his people.

Or "cornerstone"; by which is meant a king or ruler, as the Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi; and is no other than the King Messiah, who was to come out of Judah, and did spring from that tribe, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-2.htm">1 Chronicles 5:2</a> and this is a reason why God will visit the house of Judah, or the Jews, in the latter day, because the Messiah was promised and sent unto them, salvation was of them, though they rejected him; but the Lord will have mercy on them; the Redeemer shall come to Zion in a spiritual manner, and turn away iniquity from them, and then all Israel shall be saved by him. The epithet of a "corner" stone well agrees with him, that being not only the ornament, but the strength and support of the building, which knits, cements, and keeps the whole together: Christ is a beautiful and precious cornerstone, which gives glory and lustre to the church, and is the support, yea, the foundation of it; and who joins and unites together men and angels; Jews and Gentiles; Old and New Testament saints; saints above and below; saints in all ages and places, and of all nations and denominations; and is the Head of the corner, being superior to men and angels, to the kings of the earth, and to the church of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>. <p>Out of him the nail; the Targum is, "out of him his Messiah"; which shows that this text was formerly understood of Christ by the Jews; Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it of a prince and governor; so Eliakim the governor is said to be "as a nail in a sure place", <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-23.htm">Isaiah 22:23</a> who was a type of Christ; and this agrees with Christ himself. The allusion is either to a nail, by which the timber in the building is compacted together, and the whole is strengthened, as the church is by Christ: or to a nail to which the cords of tents are fastened, as those of shepherds, travellers, or soldiers; the church is as such a tent; Christ is the nail to which its cords are fastened, which denotes the stability and security of it: or to a nail fixed in a wall, on which things are hung; on Christ are hung all the vessels of mercy; the covenant of grace, and all its promises and blessings; and all the glory of his Father's house, of his building, the temple, and of the salvation of his people, is to be hung on him. <p>Out of him the battle bow; or "warrior", as Jarchi interprets it; the Lord is a man of war; Christ makes war in righteousness; the armies of heaven follow him; he is at the head of them, and fights the battles of his people, and is victorious, and makes them more than conquerors; their spiritual armour is from him, and they are armed by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a><p>out of him every oppressor together: or "exactor" (n); which is used in a good sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a> as it must be here, since all the rest of the epithets are; and may design the apostles of Christ, who preached the doctrines of grace and righteousness, and required of men the obedience of faith; and these came out of Judah and Jerusalem, and went into all the world, demanding faith in and obedience to the Son of God. <p>(n) "exactor", Montanus, Vatablus, Tigurine version, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Calvin, Drusius, De Dieu, Cocceius, Burkius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Out <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> oppressor together.</span><p>(f) Out of Judah will the chief governor proceed, who will be as a corner to uphold the building, and as a nail to fasten it together.<p>(g) Over their enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zechariah/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">out of him came forth</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">from him (Judah)</span> <span class="ital">shall</span> <span class="bld">come forth.</span> Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-21.htm" title="And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the middle of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach to me? said the LORD.">Jeremiah 30:21</a>.

I have smitten you with blasting, and with mildew, and with hail, all the work of your hands; and not one of you (turned) to me, is the saying of Jehovah."

Here it is used not in the sense of forwards into the future, but, as the explanatory clause which follows (from before, etc.) clearly shows, in that of backwards into the past. Mitterem, literally "from the not yet of the laying ... onwards," i.e., onwards from the time when stone was laid upon stone at the temple; in other words, when the building of the temple was resumed, backwards into the past; in reality, therefore, the time before the resuming of the building of the temple: for min and mitterem cannot be taken in any other sense than in the parallel &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; which precedes it, and &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-16.htm">Haggai 2:16</a>. The objection which Koehler raises to this cannot be sustained. &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, from their existence (backwards). Most of the modern commentators take the suffix as referring to a noun, ya&#770;m&#305;&#772;m (days), to be supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15</a>; but it appears much simpler to take it as a neuter, as Mark and others do, in the sense of "before these things were or were done, viz., this day, and this work of laying stone upon stone," etc. The meaning is not doubtful, viz., looking backwards from the time when the building of the temple was resumed, in other words, before the point of time. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; commences a new sentence, in which facts that they had experienced are cited, the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; being used conditionally, and forming the protasis, the apodosis to which is given in &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;. If one came to a heap of sheaves of twenty measures (se'a&#770;h is probably to be supplied: lxx &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;), they became ten. A heap of sheaves (&#8219;a&#774;re&#772;ma&#770;h as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-7.htm">Ruth 3:7</a>), from which they promised themselves twenty measures, yielded, when threshed, no more than ten, i.e., only the half of what they expected. They experienced just the same at the pressing of the grapes. Instead of fifty buckets, which they expected, they obtained only twenty. Yeqebh was the vat into which the juice flowed when pressed out of the grapes. Cha&#770;saph, lit., to lay bare, here to draw out, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>; and pu&#772;ra&#770;h, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, the pressing-trough, here a measure, probably the measure which was generally obtained from one filling of the wine-press with grapes (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;). <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a> gives the reason why so small a result was yielded by the threshing-floor and wine-press. Jehovah smote you with blasting and mildew. These words are a reminiscence of <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>, to which passage the last words of the verse also refer.
