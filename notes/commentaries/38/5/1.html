Hitherto, from the beginning of this prophecy, “all has been consoling, and meant to cheer the hearts of the Jewish people, by holding forth to them prospects of approaching prosperity. But, lest they should grow presumptuous and careless of their conduct, it was thought proper to warn them of the conditions on which their happiness would depend; and to let them see, that however God was at present disposed to show them favour, his judgments would assuredly fall upon them with still greater weight than before, if they should again provoke him by repeated acts of wickedness.” Accordingly, this warning and information are given them by the visions of this chapter, which are of a very different kind from the preceding ones. — Blayney.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are rolls, in which God has written the great things of his law and gospel; they are flying rolls. God's word runs very swiftly, Ps 147:15. This flying roll contains a declaration of the righteous wrath of God against sinners. Oh that we saw with an eye of faith the flying roll of God's curse hanging over the guilty world as a thick cloud, not only keeping off the sunbeams of God's favour, but big with thunders, lightnings, and storms, ready to destroy them! How welcome then would the tidings of a Saviour be, who came to redeem us from the curse of the law, being himself made a curse for us! Sin is the ruin of houses and families; especially the doing hurt to others and false witness. Who knows the power of God's anger? God's curse cannot be kept out by bars or locks. While one part of the curse of God ruins the substance of the sinner, another part will rest on the soul, and sink it to everlasting punishment. All are transgressors of the law, so we cannot escape this wrath of God, except we flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us in the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hitherto all had been bright, full of the largeness of the gifts of God; of God's favor to His people ; the removal of their enemies ; the restoration and expansion and security of God's people and Church under His protection ; the acceptance of the present typical priesthood and the promise of Him, through whom there should be entire forgiveness : the abiding illumining of the Church by the Spirit of God . Yet there is a reverse side to all this, God's judgments on those who reject all His mercies. Augustine, de Civ. Del. 17:3.:Ribera: "Prophecies partly appertain to those in whose times the sacred writers prophesied, partly to the mysteries of Christ.

Sixth Vision. The Flying Roll. The fraudulent and perjuring transgressors of the law shall be extirpated from Judea.<p>1. flying roll&#8212;of papyrus, or dressed skins, used for writing on when paper was not known. It was inscribed with the words of the curse (De 27:15-26; 28:15-68). Being written implied that its contents were beyond all escape or repeal (Eze 2:9). Its "flying" shows that its curses were ready swiftly to visit the transgressors. It was unrolled, or else its dimensions could not have been seen (Zec 5:2). Being open to all, none could say in excuse he knew not the law and the curses of disobedience. As the previous visions intimated God's favor in restoring the Jewish state, so this vision announces judgment, intimating that God, notwithstanding His favor, did not approve of their sins. Being written on both sides, "on this and on that side" (Zec 5:3) [Vatablus] connects it with the two tables of the law (Ex 32:15), and implies its comprehensiveness. One side denounced "him that sweareth falsely (Zec 5:4) by God's name," according to the third commandment of the first table, duty to God; the other side denounced theft, according to the eighth commandment, which is in the second table, duty to one's neighbor.By the flying roll is showed the curse of thieves and of false swearers, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/5-1.htm" title="Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll....">Zechariah 5:1-4</a></span>.

"I will sweep, sweep away everything from the face of the earth, is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>. I will sweep away man and cattle, sweep away the fowls of heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the offences with the sinners, and I cut off men from the face of the earth, is the saying of Jehovah." The announcement of the judgment upon the whole earth not only serves to sharpen the following threat of judgment upon Judah and Jerusalem in this sense, "Because Jehovah judges the whole world, He will punish the apostasy of Judah all the more;" but the judgment upon the whole world forms an integral part of his prophecy, which treats more fully of the execution of the judgment in and upon Judah, simply because Judah forms the kingdom of God, which is to be purified from its dross by judgment, and led on towards the end of its divine calling. As Zephaniah here opens the judgment awaiting Judah with an announcement of a judgment upon the whole world, so does he assign the reason for his exhortation to repentance in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1-15</a>, by showing that all nations will succumb to the judgment; and then announces in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-9.htm">Zephaniah 3:9</a>., as the fruit of the judgment, the conversion of the nations to Jehovah, and the glorification of the kingdom of God. The way to salvation leads through judgment, not only for the world with its enmity against God, but for the degenerate theocracy also. It is only through judgment that the sinful world can be renewed and glorified. The verb &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, the hiphil of su&#772;ph, is strengthened by the inf. abs. &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, which is formed from the verb &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, a verb of kindred meaning. Su&#772;ph and 'a&#770;saph signify to take away, to sweep away, hiph. to put an end, to destroy. Ko&#772;l, everything, is specified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a> : men and cattle, the birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea; the verb 'a&#770;se&#772;ph being repeated before the two principal members. This specification stands in unmistakeable relation to the threatening of God: to destroy all creatures for the wickedness of men, from man to cattle, and to creeping things, and even to the fowls of the heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-7.htm">Genesis 6:7</a>). By playing upon this threat, Zephaniah intimates that the approaching judgment will be as general over the earth, and as terrible, as the judgment of the flood. Through this judgment God will remove or destroy the offences (stumbling-blocks) together with the sinners. &#1488;&#1514; before &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be the sign of the accusative, but can only be a preposition, with, together with, since the objects to &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; are all introduced without the sign of the accusative; and, moreover, if &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; were intended for an accusative, the copula Vv would not be omitted. Hammakhshe&#772;lo&#770;th does not mean houses about to fall (Hitzig), which neither suits the context nor can be grammatically sustained, since even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-6.htm">Isaiah 3:6</a> hammakhshe&#772;la&#770;h is not the fallen house, but the state brought to ruin by the sin of the people; and makhshe&#772;la&#770;h is that against which or through which a person meets with a fall. Makhshe&#772;lo&#772;th are all the objects of coarser and more refined idolatry, not merely the idolatrous images, but all the works of wickedness, like &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a>. The judgment, however, applies chiefly to men, i.e., to sinners, and hence in the last clause the destruction of men from off the earth is especially mentioned. The irrational creation is only subject to &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, on account of and through the sin of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>.). </body></html>
