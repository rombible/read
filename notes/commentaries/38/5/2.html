And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits....">Zechariah 5:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">The length thereof is twenty cubits, </span>&c. — Such scrolls for writing were usually longer than they were broad; so this was represented as ten yards in length, and five in breadth. The roll was very large, to show what a number of curses would come upon the wicked. <span class="ital">Then said he, This</span> <span class="ital">is the curse, </span>&c. — This roll, or book, contains the curses, or judgments, due to sinners, particularly sinners of the Jews, who have been favoured with greater light and privileges than other people, and whose sins, therefore, are the more inexcusable. <span class="ital">That goeth over the face of the whole earth — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">of the whole land; </span>for the land of Judea only seems to be here meant. <span class="ital">Every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side, </span>&c. — The roll was written on both sides, as that mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-10.htm" title="And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.">Ezekiel 2:10</a> : and on one side were contained the judgments against stealing, and on the other against false swearing. These two sins are joined together, because in the Jewish courts men were compelled to purge themselves by oath, in case they were accused of theft; and they often would forswear themselves rather than discover the truth. Considering the time when Zechariah prophesied, it seems probable, that those who made use of fraud with respect to what had been dedicated to the rebuilding of the temple, and restoring the service of God, are here particularly referred to. According to Calmet, under the two names of <span class="ital">theft </span>and <span class="ital">false swearing, </span>the Hebrews and Chaldeans included all other crimes; theft denoting every injustice and violence executed against men, and perjury all crimes committed against God. Instead of <span class="ital">on this side, </span>and <span class="ital">on that side, </span>Newcome reads, <span class="ital">from hence, </span>namely, from the land. And instead of <span class="ital">shall be cut off, </span>the Vulgate reads, <span class="ital">judicabitur, shall be judged; </span>and Houbigant, <span class="ital">shall be punished. </span>It must be acknowledged, however, that the Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">נקה</span>, so rendered, rather means, <span class="ital">carries himself as innocent, </span>or, <span class="ital">asserts himself to be innocent; </span>or, <span class="ital">is declared innocent, </span>or, <span class="ital">left unpunished, </span>namely, by the magistrate. Blayney therefore translates the clause, <span class="ital">Because, on the one hand, every one that stealeth is as he that is guiltless; and, on the other hand, every one that sweareth is as he that is guiltless. </span>On which he observes, “The reason assigned for <span class="ital">the curse going forth through the whole land </span>is, that the good and the bad, the innocent and the guilty, were in every part of it looked upon and treated alike; so that it was time for the divine justice to interpose, and make the proper distinction between them.” <span class="ital">And it shall enter, </span>&c. — This curse shall come with commission from me; <span class="ital">into the house of the thief — </span>Where he had laid up that which he got by theft, thinking to enjoy it to his satisfaction. Or, by his house may be understood his family, estate, and goods: it shall take hold of him, and all that belong to him, and shall never leave them till their are utterly destroyed. <span class="ital">And it shall remain in the midst of the house — </span>It shall stick close to them and theirs, as Gehazi’s leprosy did to him and his posterity; or, like the leprosy that infects a house, and cannot be purged till the house itself be pulled down.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-4 The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are rolls, in which God has written the great things of his law and gospel; they are flying rolls. God's word runs very swiftly, Ps 147:15. This flying roll contains a declaration of the righteous wrath of God against sinners. Oh that we saw with an eye of faith the flying roll of God's curse hanging over the guilty world as a thick cloud, not only keeping off the sunbeams of God's favour, but big with thunders, lightnings, and storms, ready to destroy them! How welcome then would the tidings of a Saviour be, who came to redeem us from the curse of the law, being himself made a curse for us! Sin is the ruin of houses and families; especially the doing hurt to others and false witness. Who knows the power of God's anger? God's curse cannot be kept out by bars or locks. While one part of the curse of God ruins the substance of the sinner, another part will rest on the soul, and sink it to everlasting punishment. All are transgressors of the law, so we cannot escape this wrath of God, except we flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us in the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he - (the interpreting angel) said unto me It cannot be without meaning, that the dimensions of the roll should be those of the tabernacle , as the last vision was that of the candlestick, after the likeness of the candlestick therein.

That is, the angel: <p>What seest thou? and I answered, I see a flying roll, the length whereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits; so that it was a very large one, a volume of a very uncommon size, especially it may so seem to us; but in other nations they have very long rolls or volumes, even longer than this: the Russians write their acts, protests, and other court matters, on long rolls of paper, some twenty ells, some thirty, and some sixty, and more (x): and this being the length and breadth of the porch before the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a> hence the Jewish writers conclude that this flying roll came from thence: it may design either the roll or book in which the sins of men are written; which is very large, and will quickly be brought into judgment, when it will be opened, and men will be judged according to it; which shows the notice God takes of the sins of men; the exact knowledge he has of them; his strict remembrance of them; and the certain account men must give of them another day: or, the book of God's judgments upon sinners, such as was Ezekiel's roll, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a> which are many and great; are rolled up, and not at present to be searched into; but are flying, coming on, and will be speedily executed: or rather the book of the law, called a roll or volume, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> and which will be a swift witness against the breakers of it, as more fully appears from the explanation of it in the next verse <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>. It is a mere fancy and conceit of some that the Talmud is meant by this roll, the body of the Jewish traditions, which make void the commands of God, take away the blessing, and leave a curse in the land, as they did in the land of Judea. <p>(x) Eskuche apud Burkium in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said to me, What seest thou?

The dimensions of the roll seem merely to be mentioned as an expression of the prophet’s wonder at its size. The beholder of such a strange apparition in the heavens would not unnaturally say how large he took it to be.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He said.</span> The angel-interpreter spoke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a>). The length thereof, etc. Taking the cubit at a foot and a half, the size of the roll is enormous, and may well have aroused the prophet's wonder. The dimensions given correspond to those of the porch of Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>), twenty cubits long by ten broad. These are also the dimensions of the holy place in the tabernacle, and of Solomon's brazen altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>). The careful statement of the size of the roll indicates that some special meaning is attached to these measurements. We do not know that any symbolical signification was recognized in the porch of the temple; but these dimensions may well contain a reference to the sanctuary and the altar, as Knabenbauer explains, "The curse is of the same measure as that altar which was the instrument of expiation and reconciliation, and as that sanctuary which was the entrance to the holy of holies." Others consider that the curse is pronounced according to the measure of the sanctuary, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the Divine Law; or that all might thus know that it came from God, and that the possession of the temple did not secure the people from vengeance unless they were pure and obedient. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zephaniah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-1.htm">Zephaniah 1:1</a> contains the heading, which has been explained in the introduction. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a> form the preface. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2</a>. "I will sweep, sweep away everything from the face of the earth, is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>. I will sweep away man and cattle, sweep away the fowls of heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the offences with the sinners, and I cut off men from the face of the earth, is the saying of Jehovah." The announcement of the judgment upon the whole earth not only serves to sharpen the following threat of judgment upon Judah and Jerusalem in this sense, "Because Jehovah judges the whole world, He will punish the apostasy of Judah all the more;" but the judgment upon the whole world forms an integral part of his prophecy, which treats more fully of the execution of the judgment in and upon Judah, simply because Judah forms the kingdom of God, which is to be purified from its dross by judgment, and led on towards the end of its divine calling. As Zephaniah here opens the judgment awaiting Judah with an announcement of a judgment upon the whole world, so does he assign the reason for his exhortation to repentance in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1-15</a>, by showing that all nations will succumb to the judgment; and then announces in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-9.htm">Zephaniah 3:9</a>., as the fruit of the judgment, the conversion of the nations to Jehovah, and the glorification of the kingdom of God. The way to salvation leads through judgment, not only for the world with its enmity against God, but for the degenerate theocracy also. It is only through judgment that the sinful world can be renewed and glorified. The verb &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, the hiphil of su&#772;ph, is strengthened by the inf. abs. &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, which is formed from the verb &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, a verb of kindred meaning. Su&#772;ph and 'a&#770;saph signify to take away, to sweep away, hiph. to put an end, to destroy. Ko&#772;l, everything, is specified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a> : men and cattle, the birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea; the verb 'a&#770;se&#772;ph being repeated before the two principal members. This specification stands in unmistakeable relation to the threatening of God: to destroy all creatures for the wickedness of men, from man to cattle, and to creeping things, and even to the fowls of the heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-7.htm">Genesis 6:7</a>). By playing upon this threat, Zephaniah intimates that the approaching judgment will be as general over the earth, and as terrible, as the judgment of the flood. Through this judgment God will remove or destroy the offences (stumbling-blocks) together with the sinners. &#1488;&#1514; before &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be the sign of the accusative, but can only be a preposition, with, together with, since the objects to &#1488;&#1505;&#1507; are all introduced without the sign of the accusative; and, moreover, if &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; were intended for an accusative, the copula Vv would not be omitted. Hammakhshe&#772;lo&#770;th does not mean houses about to fall (Hitzig), which neither suits the context nor can be grammatically sustained, since even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-6.htm">Isaiah 3:6</a> hammakhshe&#772;la&#770;h is not the fallen house, but the state brought to ruin by the sin of the people; and makhshe&#772;la&#770;h is that against which or through which a person meets with a fall. Makhshe&#772;lo&#772;th are all the objects of coarser and more refined idolatry, not merely the idolatrous images, but all the works of wickedness, like &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a>. The judgment, however, applies chiefly to men, i.e., to sinners, and hence in the last clause the destruction of men from off the earth is especially mentioned. The irrational creation is only subject to &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, on account of and through the sin of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>.). </body></html>
