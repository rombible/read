This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel. Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And behold there was lifted up a talent of lead - the heaviest Hebrew weight, elsewhere of gold or silver; the golden talent weighing, 1,300,000 grains; the silver, 660,000; here, being lead, it is obviously an undefined mass, though circular , corresponding to the Ephah. The Ephah too was the largest Hebrew measure, whose compass cannot now, with certainty, be ascertained . Both probably were, in the vision, ideal. Theodoret: "Holy Scripture calleth the punishment of sin, lead, as being by nature heavy. This the divine David teacheth us, "mine iniquities are gone over my head: as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>. The divine Zechariah seeth sin under the image of a woman; for most evils are engendered by luxury. But he seeth the punishment, like most heavy lead, lying upon the mouth of iniquity, according to a Psalm, "all iniquity shall stop her mouth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-42.htm">Psalm 107:42</a>.

By the angel; since he is afterwards said to cast it upon the mouth of the "ephah". A cicar, or talent of silver, with the Jews, was equal to three thousand shekels, as may be gathered from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a> and weighed a hundred and twenty five pounds (a); or, as others, a hundred and twenty (b), and, according to the more exact account of Dr. Arbuthnot, a hundred and thirteen pounds, ten ounces, one pennyweight, and ten and two seventh grains of our Troy weight. A Babylonish talent, according to Aelianus (c), weighed seventy two Attic pounds; and an Attic mina, or pound, weighed a hundred drachmas; so that it was of the weight of seven thousand two hundred such drachmas. An Alexandrian talent was equal to twelve thousand Attic drachmas; and these the same with a hundred and twenty five Roman libras or pounds; which talent is supposed to be the same with that of Moses. The Roman talent contained seventy two Italic minas, which were the same with the Roman libras (d). But since the Hebrew word "cicar" signifies anything plain, and what is extended like a cake, as Arias Montanus observes (e), it may here intend a plate of lead, which was laid over the mouth of the "ephah", as a lid unto it; though indeed it is afterwards called , "a stone of lead", and so seems to design a weight. <p>And this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah; who, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-8.htm">Zechariah 5:8</a>, is called "wickedness"; and here represented by a "woman", because, say some, the woman was first in the transgression; or rather because sin is flattering and deceitful, and draws into the commission of it, and so to ruin: and this woman, wickedness, intends wicked men; all the wicked among the Jews, and even all the wicked of the world; who sit in the "ephah", very active and busy in filling up the measure of their sins, and where they sit with great pleasure and delight; very openly and visibly declare their sin, as Sodom, and hide it not; in a very proud and haughty manner, with great boldness and impudence, and in great security, without any concern about a future state, promising themselves impunity here and hereafter. This woman is a very lively emblem of the whore of Rome, sitting as a queen upon many waters; ruling over kings and princes; living deliciously, and in great ease and pleasure filling up the measure of her sins. Kimchi interprets this woman of the ten tribes, who wickedly departed from God, and were as one kingdom. <p>(a) Epiphanius de Mensuris &amp; Ponderibus. (b) Hebraei apud Buxtorf. Lex. Heb. in rad.

Here it means a disc or circular plate which formed the cover of the round shaped ephah.

"Be silent before the Lord Jehovah! For the day of Jehovah is near, for Jehovah has prepared a slaying of sacrifice, He has consecrated His called." The command, "Be silent before the Lord," which is formed after <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>, and with which the prophet summons to humble, silent submission to the judgment of God, serves to confirm the divine threat in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2-6</a>. The reason for the commanding Hush! (keep silence) is given in the statement that the day of Jehovah is close at hand (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>), and that God has already appointed the executors of the judgment. The last two clauses of the verse are formed from reminiscences taken from Isaiah. The description of the judgment as zebhach, a sacrifice, is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>). The sacrifice which God has prepared is the Jewish nation; those who are invited to this sacrificial meal ("called," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>) are not beasts and birds of prey, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, but the nations which He has consecrated to war that they may consume Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>). The extraordinary use of the verb hiqdiish (consecrated) in this connection may be explained from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>, where the nations appointed to make war against Babel are called mequdda&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m, the sanctified of Jehovah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>). </body></html>
