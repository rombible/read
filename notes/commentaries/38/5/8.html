This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel. Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And cast her into the midst of the Ephah - As yet then the measure was not full.

Cocceius understands this of the Saracens and Turks, and the barbarous nations, being cast into the Roman empire, to restrain the antichristian tyranny; but it seems better to apply it to the utter destruction of antichrist, signified by a millstone cast into the sea and sunk there, never to rise more; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a> and with it compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said, This <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> wickedness.

According to this the woman is seen “having in her hand the leaden weight with which she was wont to traffic, and sitting crouched down in an empty bushel or ephah, as if that were her true seat and throne.… It was a special form of wickedness that was here pourtrayed, namely, unrighteousness as it manifests itself in matters of weight and measure, or, to designate it in our Lord’s own words, ‘unfaithfulness as regards the unrighteous mammon’ … But ‘with the same measure that ye mete withal, shall it be measured to you again.’ The very instrument which the woman used for her unholy work was to be the means of her confusion. The ephah in which she sat was made the chariot in which she was removed from the land; and the angel, with righteous indignation, seized the woman herself, dashed her down into the ephah as she was about to rise from her sitting posture, and taking hold of the leaden weight, flung the heavy ‘stone of lead’ upon her mouth. Thus did the angel indicate that ‘wickedness’ would be a subject of Divine wrath. He smote her in the mouth wherewith she had so often uttered words of lying and fraud; and did so with the very instrument with which she was wont to measure her ungodly gain. Thus was her mouth stopped (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-42.htm" title="The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.">Psalm 107:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-16.htm" title="So the poor has hope, and iniquity stops her mouth.">Job 5:16</a>), and the instrument of sin was made the instrument of her punishment.” (Rev. C. H. H. Wright.) The moral of the vision, however, is not the destruction, nor even the punishment of wickedness, but its expulsion from the holy land, that it may go to its own place.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is wickedness.</span> This woman is the personification of wickedness. It is very common to find backsliding Israel represented as a faithless and adulterous woman (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>; and the parable of the two women in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">He cast it;</span> <span class="accented">her</span> - the woman. As the woman rose, or tried to rise, from the ephah, the angel flung her down into it. It is possible, as some commentators suppose, that the ephah into which wickedness is thrust represents the measure of iniquity which, being reached, constrains God to punish (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where the dispossession of the Amorites is postponed till their iniquity is full). <span class="cmt_word">The weight of lead;</span> literally, as the LXX., <span class="accented">the stone of lead</span>; Vulgate<span class="accented">, massam plumbeam.</span> This is the cover of the ephah, that which is called the "talent of lead" in the preceding verse. This heavy cover the angel cast upon the mouth of the ephah, in order to confine the woman therein (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2</a>, which passage may explain why the cover is called "a stone"). Dr. Wright and some other commentators, referring the passage to theft and perjury alone, consider that the woman held in her hand the leaden weight with which she weighed her gains, and was sitting in the ephah which she used in her traffic; so that she represents dishonesty in the matter of weight and measure. She is punished by the means of the instruments she had used unrighteously; the weight is dashed upon her lying mouth, and the ephah, her throne, is made the vehicle that carries her out of the land. But it seems a mistake to confine the iniquity mentioned to the two special sins of theft and perjury; nor would the talent and the ephah be natural instruments of stealing and false swearing; and the point of the vision is not the punishment of wickedness, but its expulsion from the land. It is true that the pronominal suffix in the mouth thereof is feminine, and that the LXX. makes it refer to the woman, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. But it may equally refer to <span class="accented">ephah</span>, which is also feminine. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zephaniah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judgment will fall with equal severity upon the idolatrous and sinners of every rank (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8-11</a>), and no one in Jerusalem will be able to save himself from it (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13</a>). In three double verses Zephaniah brings out three classes of men who differ in their civil position, and also in their attitude towards God, as those who will be smitten by the judgment: viz., (1) the princes, i.e., the royal family and superior servants of the king, who imitate the customs of foreigners, and oppress the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-9.htm">Zephaniah 1:9</a>); (2) the merchants, who have grown rich through trade and usury (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-10.htm">Zephaniah 1:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>); (3) the irreligious debauchees (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13</a>). The first of these he threatens with visitation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>. "And it will come to pass in the day of Jehovah's sacrifice, that I visit the princes and the king's sons, and all who clothe themselves in foreign dress. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-9.htm">Zephaniah 1:9</a>. And I visit every one who leaps over the threshold on that day, those who fill the Lord's house with violence and deceit." The enumeration of those who are exposed to the judgment commences with the princes, i.e., the heads of the tribes and families, who naturally filled the higher offices of state; and the king's sons, not only the sons of Josiah, who were still very young (see the Introduction), but also the sons of the deceased kings, the royal princes generally. The king himself is not named, because Josiah walked in the ways of the Lord, and on account of his piety and fear of God was not to lie to see the outburst of the judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27-28</a>). The princes and king's sons are threatened with punishment, not on account of the high position which they occupied in the state, but on account of the ungodly disposition which they manifested. For since the clauses which follow not only mention different classes of men, but also point out the sins of the different classes, we must also expect this in the case of the princes and the king's sons, and consequently must refer the dressing in foreign clothes, which is condemned in the second half of the verse, to the princes and king's sons also, and understand the word "all" as relating to those who imitated their manners without being actually princes or king's sons. Malbu&#772;sh nokhr&#305;&#772; (foreign dress) does not refer to the clothes worn by the idolaters in their idolatrous worship (Chald., Rashi, Jer.), nor to the dress prohibited in the law, viz., "women dressing in men's clothes, or men dressing in women's clothes" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-11.htm">Deuteronomy 22:11</a>), as Grotius maintains, nor to clothes stolen from the poor, or taken from them as pledges; but, as nokhr&#305;&#772; signifies a foreigner, to foreign dress. Drusius has already pointed this out, and explains the passage as follows: "I think that the reference is to all those who betrayed the levity of their minds by wearing foreign dress. For I have no doubt that in that age some copied the Egyptians in their style of dress, and others the Babylonians, according as they favoured the one nation or the other. The prophet therefore says, that even those who adopted foreign habits, and conformed themselves to the customs of the victorious nation, would not be exempt." The last allusion is certainly untenable, and it would be more correct to say with Strauss: "The prophets did not care for externals of this kind, but it was evident to them that 'as the dress, so the heart;' that is to say, the clothes were witnesses in their esteem of the foreign inclinations of the heart." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-9.htm">Zephaniah 1:9</a> many commentators find a condemnation of an idolatrous use of foreign customs; regarding the leaping over the threshold as an imitation of the priests of Dagon, who adopted the custom, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-5.htm">1 Samuel 5:5</a>, of leaping over the threshold when they entered the temple of that idol. But an imitation of that custom could only take place in temples of Dagon, and it appears perfectly inconceivable that it should have been transferred to the threshold of the king's palace, unless the king was regarded as an incarnation of Dagon, - a thought which could never enter the minds of Israelitish idolaters, since even the Philistian kings did not hold themselves to be incarnations of their idols. If we turn to the second hemistich, the thing condemned is the filling of their masters' houses with violence; and this certainly does not stand in any conceivable relation to that custom of the priests of Dagon; and yet the words "who fill," etc., are proved to be explanatory of the first half of the verse, by the fact that the second clause is appended without the copula Vav, and without the repetition of the preposition &#1506;&#1500;. Now, if a fresh sin were referred to there, the copula Vav, at all events, could not have been omitted. We must therefore understand by the leaping over the threshold a violent and sudden rushing into houses to steal the property of strangers (Calvin, Ros., Ewald, Strauss, and others), so that the allusion is to "dishonourable servants of the king, who thought that they could best serve their master by extorting treasures from their dependants by violence and fraud" (Ewald). &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, of their lord, i.e., of the king, not "of their lords:" the plural is in the pluralis majestatis, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-16.htm">1 Samuel 26:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>, etc. </body></html>
