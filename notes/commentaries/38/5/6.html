This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling the measure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be delivered into the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The woman sitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church and nation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon the sinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seems to mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure of their iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel. Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carried away to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should be hurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, as they had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, and their sufferings shall continue far longer than in their late captivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upon their own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measure fills.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the ephah that goeth forth - Theodoret: "We too are taught by this, that the Lord of all administers all things in weight and measure. So, foretelling to Abraham that his seed should be a sojourner and the cause thereof, He says, "for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, that is, they have not yet committed sins enough to merit entire destruction, wherefore I cannot yet endure to give them over to the slaughter, but will wait for the measure of their iniquity." The relation then of this vision to the seventh is, that the seventh tells of God's punishment on individual sinners; this, on the whole people, when the iniquity of the whole is full.<p>This is their resemblance, as we say, their look, that is, the look, appearance, of the inhabitants "in all the land." This then being the condition of the people of the land, at the time to which the vision relates, the symbolical carrying away of the full measure of sin cannot be its forgiveness, since there was no repentance, but the taking away of the sin with the sinner. Cyril: "The Lord of all is good and loving to mankind; for He is patient toward sinners and endures transgressors, waiting for the repentance of each; but if one perseveres long in iniquity, and come to the term of the endurance allowed, it remains that he should be subjected to punishment, and there is no account of this long forebarance, nor can he be exempt from judgment proportioned to what he has done. So then Christ says to the Jewish people, rushing with unbridled phrensy to all strange excess, "Fill ye up the measure of your fathers" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-32.htm">Matthew 23:32</a>. The measure then, which was seen, pointed to the filling up of the measure of the transgression of the people against Himself." Jerome: "The angel bids him behold the sins of the people Israel, heaped together in a perfect measure, and the transgression of all fulfilled - that the sins, which escaped notice, one by one, might, when collected together, be laid open to the eyes of all, and Israel might go forth from its place, and it might be shown to all what she was in her own land." Ribera: "I think the Lord alluded to the words of the prophet, as though He would say, "Fill up the measure of sins" which your fathers began of old, as it is in Zechariah, that is, ye will soon fill it; for ye so haste to do evil, that ye will soon fill it to the utmost." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

After he had lifted up his eyes and seen it, he desires to know both what it was, and what was the meaning of it: <p>and he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth; which was a measure much in use with the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a> it is the same with the "bath", and held above seven wine gallons. The Targum interprets this of such who dealt in false measures, whose sin is exposed, and their punishment set forth; but rather it designs the measure of iniquity filling up, either in Judea, particularly in the times of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-32.htm">Matthew 23:32</a> or in the whole world, and especially in the antichristian states, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>, and <p>He said moreover, this is their resemblance through all the earth; or "this is their eye" (z); what they are looking at, and intent upon, namely, this ephah; that is, to fill up the measure of their iniquity: or, as Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it, this ephah, which thou seest, shows that there is an eye upon them which sees their works; and this is the eye of the Lord, which sees and takes notice of all the evil actions of men, not as approving them, but as observing them, and avenging them. Cocceius, by the "ephah", understands an abundance of temporal good things bestowed upon the Christian church in Constantine's time and following, on which the eyes of carnal men were looking. <p>(z)  "haec est oculus eorum", Pagninus, Montanus, Munster, Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Tarnovius, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I said, What <i>is</i> it?

It is better, however, to give a wider meaning to the word “this,” viz. this ephah, with all that you will see in the vision regarding it, is the resemblance or representation of the wicked through all the land, and of what shall befall them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the earth</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the land.</span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is it?</span> The prophet did not clearly discern the object, or his question may mean, "What does it signify?" <span class="cmt_word">An ephah;</span> <span class="accented">the ephah</span>, as "the curse" (ver. 3). The ephah was the largest of the dry measures in use among the Jews, and was equal to six or seven gallons. It was, of course, too small to contain a woman. The LXX. calls it simply "the measure;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">amphora</span>; and it must be considered as an imaginary vessel of huge size. It may have a tacit reference to dishonest dealings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This is their resemblance;</span> literally, <span class="accented">this is their eye</span>. The Authorized Version explains the meaning accurately. "Eye" is often used for that which is seen, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a>, where the Authorized Version has "colour;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>, where in reference to the manna we read, "The eve thereof was as the eye of bdellium" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4, 16</a>). So here the meaning is: This ephah and this whole vision represent the wicked in the land. Some take "the eye" to mean the object of sight, that to which they look. But the ephah was not sot forth for all the people to examine. The LXX. and Syriac, from some variation in the reading, have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "iniquity," and some critics have desired to adopt this in the text. But authority and necessity are equally wanting. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zephaniah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judgment coming upon the whole earth with all its inhabitants will fall especially upon Judah and Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>. "And I stretch my hand over Judah, and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and cut off from this place the remnant of Baal, the name of the consecrated servants, together with the priests. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>. And those who worship the army of heaven upon the roofs, and the worshippers who swear to Jehovah, and who swear by their king. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-6.htm">Zephaniah 1:6</a>. And those who draw back from Jehovah, and who did not seek Jehovah, and did not inquire for Him." God stretches out His hand (&#1497;&#1491;) or His arm (&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;) to smite the ungodly with judgments (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/6-6.htm">Zephaniah 6:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-11.htm">Isaiah 9:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-20.htm">Isaiah 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-26.htm">Isaiah 14:26</a>.). Through the judgment upon Judah and Jerusalem He will cut off &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, the remnant of Baal, i.e., all that remains of Baal and of idolatry; for Baal or the Baal-worship stands per synecdochen for idolatry of every kind (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10</a>). The emphasis lies upon "the remnant," all that still exists of the Baal-worship or idolatry, even to the very last remnant; so that the emphasis presupposes that the extermination has already begun, that the worship of Baal no longer exists in undiminished force and extent. It must not be limited, however, to the complete abolition of the outward or grosser idolatry, but includes the utter extermination of the grosser as well as the more refined Baal-worship. That the words should be so understood is required by the parallel clause: the name of the consecrated servants together with the priests. Kema&#770;r&#305;&#772;m are not prophets of Baal, but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>, the priests appointed by the kings of Judah for the worship of the high places and the idolatrous worship of Jehovah (for the etymology of the word, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>). The ko&#772;ha&#774;n&#305;&#772;m, as distinguished from these, are idolatrous priests in the stricter sense of the word (i.e., those who conducted the literal idolatry). The names of both the idolatrous priests of Jehovah and the literal priests of the idols are to be cut off, so that not only the persons referred to will disappear, but even their names will be heard no more. Along with the idols and their priests, the worshippers of idols are also to be destroyed. Just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a> two classes of priests are distinguished, so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a> are two classes of worshippers, viz., (1) the star-worshippers, and (2) those who tried to combine the worship of Jehovah and the worship of idols; and to these a third class is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-6.htm">Zephaniah 1:6</a>. The worship of the stars was partly Baal-worship, the sun, moon, and stars being worshipped as the bearers of the powers of nature worshipped in Baal and Asherah (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>); and partly Sabaeism or pure star-worship, the stars being worshipped as the originators of all growth and decay in nature, and the leaders and regulators of all sublunary things (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>). The worship took place upon the roofs, i.e., on altars erected upon the flat roofs of the houses, chiefly by the burning of incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>), but also by the offering of sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>; see the comm. in loc.). "They offered the sacrifices upon the roofs, that they might be the better able to see the stars in the heavens" (Theodoret). Along with the star-worshippers as the representatives of literal idolatry, Zephaniah mentions as a second class the worshippers who swear partly to Jehovah, and partly by their king, i.e., who go limping on two sides (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>), or try to combine the worship of Jehovah with that of Baal. Malka&#770;m, their king, is Baal, who is distinctly called king in the inscriptions (see Movers, Phnizier, i. pp. 171-2), and not the "earthly king of the nation," as Hitzig has erroneously interpreted the Masoretic text, in consequence of which he proposes to read milko&#772;m, i.e., Moloch. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; with &#1500; signifies to take an oath to Jehovah, i.e., to bind one's self on oath to His service; whereas &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; with &#1489; (to swear by a person) means to call upon Him as God when taking an oath. The difference between the two expressions answers exactly to the religious attitude of the men in question, who pretended to be worshippers of Jehovah, and yet with every asseveration took the name of Baal into their mouth. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-6.htm">Zephaniah 1:6</a> we have not two further classes mentioned, viz., "the vicious and the irreligious," as Hitzig supposes; but the persons here described form only one single class. Retiring behind Jehovah, drawing back from Him, turning the back upon God, is just the same as not seeking Jehovah, or not inquiring after Him. The persons referred to are the religiously indifferent, those who do not trouble themselves about God, the despisers of God. </body></html>
