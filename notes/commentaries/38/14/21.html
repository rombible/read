Gospel worship is represented by the keeping of the feast of tabernacles. Every day of a Christian's life is a day of the feast of tabernacles; every Lord's day especially is the great day of the feast; therefore every day let us worship the Lord of hosts, and keep every Lord's day with peculiar solemnity. It is just for God to withhold the blessings of grace from those who do not attend the means of grace. It is a sin that is its own punishment; those who forsake the duty, forfeit the privilege of communion with God. A time of complete peace and purity of the church will arrive. Men will carry on their common affairs, and their sacred services, upon the same holy principles of faith, love and obedience. Real holiness shall be more diffused, because there shall be a more plentiful pouring forth of the Spirit of holiness than ever before. There shall be holiness even in common things. Every action and every enjoyment of the believer, should be so regulated according to the will of God, that it may be directed to his glory. Our whole lives should be as one constant sacrifice, or act of devotion; no selfish motive should prevail in any of our actions. But how far is the Christian church from this state of purity! Other times, however, are at hand, and the Lord will reform and enlarge his church, as he has promised. Yet in heaven alone will perfect holiness and happiness be found.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the Lord - Everything is to be advanced in holiness. All the common utensils everywhere in the people of God shall not only be holy, but "holiness," and capable of the same use as the vessels of the temple.<p>And there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts - The actual Canaanite had long since ceased to be; the Gibeonites, the last remnant of them, had been absorbed among the people of God. But "all Israel" were not "of Israel." Isaiah had called its princes and people, "rulers of Sodom, people of Gomorrah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>. Ezekiel had said, "Thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>. Hosea used at least the term of two-fold meaning, "Canaan, in whose hands are the balances of deceit" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>; and Zephaniah, "All the people of Canaan are destroyed" <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>. After the time of the Canon, Daniel is introduced saying, "O thou seed of Canaan and not of Judah" . Ezekiel had spoken of ungodly priests, not only as uncircumcised in heart (according to the language of Deuteronomy Deu 10:16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>), but uncircumcised in flesh also, altogether alien from the people of God <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-7.htm">Ezekiel 44:7</a>. The prophet then speaks, as Isaiah, "It shall be called the way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>, and Joel, "then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-17.htm">Joel 3:17</a> This shall have its full fulfillment in the time of the end. "There shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither" whatsoever "worketh abomination or a lie;" and, "without" are "dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters, and whatsoever loveth and maketh a lie" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>.<p>Cyril: "Although born of the blood of Israel, those of old eagerly imitated the alien Canaanites. But after that the Only-Begotten Word of God came among us, and, having justified by faith sealed with the Holy Spirit, those who came to His grace, our mind hath been steadfast, unshaken, fixed in piety. Nor will anyone persuade those who are sanctified, to honor any other god save Him who is, by nature and in truth, God, whom we have known in Christ. For in Himself He hath shown us the Father, saying, "He that hath seen Me hash seen the Father" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>. Wherefore "in that" day, that is, at that time, he says, "there shall be no Canaanite," that is, alien and idolater, "in the house of the Lord Almighty?" Theodoret: "But may the Almighty God bring the saying true at this time also, that no Canaanite should be seen among us, but that all should live according to the Gospellaws. and await that blessed hope and the appearance of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the Father with the Holy Spirit, now and ever and to endless ages.

Moreover, a Canaanite may design an impure person, a hypocrite; and though there have been many such in the church of God in all ages, yet at this time there will be few or none, comparatively speaking; and in the personal reign of Christ there will be no wicked men at all: in the new heavens and new earth will dwell righteousness, or only righteous persons; all the wicked of the earth will be destroyed before this state takes place; only raised ones, the saints that partake of the first resurrection, will be there; they will be all holy and righteous persons; nothing shall enter into it that defiles or makes an abomination or a lie, only those that do the commandments of God; nor will there be any manner of sin or wickedness there: sin, like the Canaanites of old, continues in the saints as long as they are in the present state; and though it has not the dominion over them, yet is as grievous pricks and thorns unto them, and is left in them to prove them; but in this happy state there will be no more sin, no more this pricking brier and grieving thorn. That the word Canaanite is here to be taken in a figurative sense is certain; for, literally understood, there is no such person in the world now, nor has been for many hundreds of years, even an inhabitant of Canaan, or one so called. <p>(m) "mercator", V.

The whole scope of the passage, however, is in favour of the view that “the Canaanite” here means any unclean person, whether heathen who had not accepted the religion and consecrated himself to the service of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/13-4.htm" title="And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah:...">Nehemiah 13:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/21-28.htm" title="Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place....">Acts 21:28-29</a>), or Jew who in heart and life was no better than a heathen (comp. “O thou seed of Chanaan and not of Juda,” Story of Susanna, ver. 56).

If any vessel might now be used in God's service, worshippers would no longer be obliged to buy special bowls from those who sold in the temple courts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>). But it is best in agreement with the context to take "Canaanite" to mean any unclean or profane person (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>, etc.). Thus Daniel, in the History of Susanna, ver. 56, addresses the wicked elder, "Thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Jude;" and Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>) calls the chiefs of Israel "rulers of Sodom," and "people of Gomorrah." Henceforward the "people shall be all righteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>). There shall be one, holy, Catholic Church. Thus the vision of the golden candlestick (ch. 4.) is fulfilled; and that this should come to pass is the design of God's manifold providences and operations (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zechariah/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A further and still clearer explanation of the angel's answer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>) is given in the words of Jehovah which follow in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-8.htm">Zechariah 4:8-10</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-8.htm">Zechariah 4:8</a>. "And the word of Jehovah came to me thus: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>. The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it; and thou wilt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>. For who despiseth the day of small things? and they joyfully behold the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, those seven: the eyes of Jehovah, they sweep through the whole earth." This word of God is not addressed to the prophet through the angelus interpres, but comes direct from Jehovah, though, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a> clearly shows when compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>, through the Maleach Jehovah. Although the words "the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house" unquestionably refer primarily to the building of the earthly temple, and announce the finishing of that building by Zerubbabel, yet the apodosis commencing with "and thou shalt know" shows that the sense is not thereby exhausted, but rather that the building is simply mentioned here as a type of the spiritual temple (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12-13</a>), and that the completion of the typical temple simply furnishes a pledge of the completion of the true temple. For it was not by the finishing of the earthly building, but solely by the carrying out of the kingdom of God which this shadowed forth, that Judah could discern that the angel of Jehovah had been sent to it. This is also apparent from the reason assigned for this promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, the meaning of which has been explained in very different ways. Many take &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; as an apodosis, and connect it with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1497; &#1489;&#1494; as the protasis: "for whoever despises the day of small things, they shall see with joy," etc. (lxx, Chald., Pesh., Vulg., Luther., Calv., and others); but &#1502;&#1497; can hardly be taken as an indefinite pronoun, inasmuch as the introduction of the apodosis by Vav would be unsuitable, and it has hitherto been impossible to find a single well-established example of the indefinite &#1502;&#1497; followed by a perfect with Vav consec. And the idea that vesa&#770;mechu&#772; is a circumstantial clause, in the sense of "whereas they see with joy" (Hitzig, Koehler), is equally untenable, for in a circumstantial clause the verb never stands at the head, but always the subject; and this is so essential, that if the subject of the minor (or circumstantial) clause is a noun which has already been mentioned in a major clause, either the noun itself, or at any rate its pronoun, must be repeated (Ewald, 341, a), because this is the only thing by which the clause can be recognised as a circumstantial clause. We must therefore take &#1502;&#1497; as an interrogative pronoun: Who has ever despised the day of the small things? and understand the question in the sense of a negation, "No one has ever despised," etc. The perfect baz with the syllable sharpened, for ba&#770;z, from bu&#772;z (like tach for ta&#770;ch in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-18.htm">Isaiah 44:18</a>; cf. Ges. 72, Anm. 8), expresses a truth of experience resting upon facts. The words contain a perfect truth, if we only take them in the sense in which they were actually intended, - namely, that no one who hopes to accomplish, or does accomplish, anything great, despises the day of the small things. Yo&#772;m qetanno&#772;th, a day on which only small things occur (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>). This does not merely mean the day on which the foundation-stone of the temple was first laid, and the building itself was still in the stage of its small beginnings, according to which the time when the temple was built up again in full splendour would be the day of great things (Koehler and others). For the time when Zerubbabel's temple was finished - namely, the sixth year of Darius - was just as miserable as that in which the foundation was laid, and the building that had been suspended was resumed once more. The whole period from Darius to the coming of the Messiah, who will be the first to accomplish great things, is a day of small things, as being a period in which everything that was done for the building of the kingdom of God seemed but small, and in comparison with the work of the Messiah really was small, although it contained within itself the germs of the greatest things.<p>The following perfects, &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, have Vav consec., and express the consequence, though not "the necessary consequence, of their having despised the day of small beginnings," as Koehler imagines, who for that reason properly rejects this view, but the consequence which will ensue if the day of small things is not despised. The fact that the clause beginning with vesa&#770;mechu&#772; is attached to the first clause of the verse in the form of a consequence, may be very simply explained on the ground that the question "who hath despised," with its negative answer, contains an admonition to the people and their rulers not to despise the small beginnings. If they lay this admonition to heart, the seven eyes of God will see with delight the plumb-lead in the hand of Zerubbabel. In the combination &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; the verb sa&#770;mechu&#772; takes the place of an adverb (Ges. 142, 3, a). &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1500; is not a stone filled up with lead, but an 'ebhen which is lead, i.e., the plumb-lead or plummet. A plummet in the hand is a sign of being engaged in the work of building, or of superintending the erection of a building. The meaning of the clause is therefore, "Then will the seven eyes of Jehovah look with joy, or with satisfaction, upon the execution," not, however, in the sense of "They will find their pleasure in this restored temple, and look upon it with protecting care" (Kliefoth); for if this were the meaning, the introduction of the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel would be a very superfluous addition. Zerubbabel is still simply the type of the future Zerubbabel - namely, the Messiah - who will build the true temple of God; and the meaning is the following: Then will the seven eyes of God help to carry out this building. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; cannot be grammatically joined to &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in the sense of "these seven eyes," as the position of 'e&#772;lleh (these) between the numeral and the noun precludes this; but &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is an explanatory apposition to &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;: "those (well-known) seven, (viz.) the eyes of Jehovah." The reference is to the seven eyes mentioned in the previous vision, which are directed upon a stone. These, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>, are the sevenfold radiations or operations of the Spirit of the Lord. Of these the angel of the Lord says still further here: They sweep through the whole earth, i.e., their influence stretches over all the earth. These words also receive their full significance only on the supposition that the angel of Jehovah is speaking of the Messianic building of the house or kingdom of God. For the eyes of Jehovah would not need to sweep through the whole earth, in order to see whatever could stand in the way and hinder the erection of Zerubbabel's temple, but simply to watch over the opponents of Judah in the immediate neighbourhood and the rule of Darius. </body></html>
