A day remarkable for the execution of divine vengeance upon you, and your city, Jerusalem. This chapter ought to have been joined to the preceding; for here the prophet continues to foretel the execution of the threatenings contained in the latter part of the former chapter; namely, how the unbelieving Jews should be destroyed by the Romans. <span class="ital">Thy spoils shall be divided in the midst of thee — </span>All that thou hast, O Jerusalem, shall become a prey to thine enemies, who shall be such absolute masters of thee, that, in the greatest security, they shall divide among themselves whatever spoil they take from thee, in the very place where they take it. <span class="ital">For I will gather all nations — </span>“The Romans, being lords of the known world, had the strength of all nations united in their forces. Thus, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1</a>,) Nebuchadnezzar is said to fight against Jerusalem with all the kingdoms of the earth.” — Lowth. <span class="ital">And the city shall be taken — </span>For God is its enemy, and who can stand before him, or before nations gathered by him? Where he gives commission, he will give success. <span class="ital">And the houses rifled, and the women ravished — </span>The Roman soldiers shall exercise those acts of lust and violence which are too frequent among conquerors. That all the outrages were committed, and the miseries endured, which are here predicted, when the Romans took Jerusalem, we have abundant proof from Josephus and other historians: see notes on Deuteronomy 28. <span class="ital">And half of the city shall go into captivity — </span>The Hebrew word rendered <span class="ital">half, </span>may be translated <span class="ital">a portion. </span>It must be observed, that the city only is here spoken of; but chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-8.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, said the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.">Zechariah 13:8</a>, where mention is made of <span class="ital">two parts </span>being cut off and dying, refers to the whole land. <span class="ital">And the residue of the people shall not be cut off — </span>“The Romans spared the young and useful part of the Jews: Josephus, <span class="ital">Bel. Jud., 6. </span>9:2. However, these were either condemned to the mines in Egypt, or exposed to the sword and to wild beasts in the provincial theatres, or sold for slaves. Ibid. It must be observed, that the forty thousand who were permitted to go where they pleased, were Idumeans: <span class="ital">Bel. Jud., 6. </span>8:2.” — Newcome. “But it is probable that the remnant of the Jews, who survived this almost exterminating destruction, and their descendants, who have for so many centuries been preserved a distinct people, in order to their future restoration, are intended.” — Scott.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-7 The Lord Jesus often stood upon the Mount of Olives when on earth. He ascended from thence to heaven, and then desolations and distresses came upon the Jewish nation. Such is the view taken of this figuratively; but many consider it as a notice of events yet unfulfilled, and that it relates to troubles of which we cannot now form a full idea. Every believer, being related to God as his God, may triumph in the expectation of Christ's coming in power, and speak of it with pleasure. During a long season, the state of the church would be deformed by sin; there would be a mixture of truth and error, of happiness and misery. Such is the experience of God's people, a mingled state of grace and corruption. But, when the season is at the worst, and most unpromising, the Lord will turn darkness into light; deliverance comes when God's people have done looking for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold the Day of the Lord cometh - Literally, "a day cometh, the Lord's," in which He Himself shall be Judge, and no longer leave man to fulfill his own will, and despise God's; in which His glory and holiness and the righteousness of all His ways shall be revealed.<p>And thy spoil shall be in the midst of thee - Jerome: "How great will the strait be, that the spoils should be divided in the midst of her.

The previous prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/13-7.htm" title="Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, said the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand on the little ones....">Zechariah 13:7-9</a>) is now expanded, attention being concentrated, however, on the city rather than on the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-8.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, said the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.">Zechariah 13:8</a>), and on the final act rather than on the long previous process of purifying discipline. It is impossible satisfactorily to adapt the terms of this prophecy, either to the taking of Jerusalem under the Maccabees, or to its destruction by the Romans. As Pusey well remarks, “those who explain it solely of this, are obliged to mingle explanations partly literal, as that Jerusalem should be the earthly Jerusalem which was destroyed, partly metaphorical, as to the mount of Olives, its division into two parts, &c.” It should moreover be observed that there is no word here of the city being <span class="ital">destroyed</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the midst of thee</span>] So complete shall be the subjugation of the city, that the enemy shall, in perfect security, portion out her spoil amongst the victorious hosts in the very midst of her.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/14-1.htm" title="Behold, the day of the LORD comes, and your spoil shall be divided in the middle of you....">Zechariah 14:1-7</a>.

Then Jehovah shall appear, as in olden time, to deliver His people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-3.htm" title="Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.">Zechariah 14:3</a>. Beneath His feet, as He descends upon the Mount of Olives, the mountain shall cleave asunder, the two parts moving northward and southward, and being separated by a wide valley running east and west, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm" title="And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in the middle thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.">Zechariah 14:4</a>. By this valley (which shall reach across the ravine of Kedron up to the city wall) the people that remain shall flee from Jerusalem, as they fled from the earthquake in Uzziah’s time. Jehovah shall come with all His holy ones, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm" title="And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.">Zechariah 14:5</a>, and this “day of the Lord,” unlike all other days and known to Him alone, shall be marked by strange phenomena of mingled light and darkness, and shall have for its evening the dawn of the everlasting day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/14-6.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:...">Zechariah 14:6-7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - &sect; 5.

It is a time when he will specially manifest his glory and power, and be recognized as allowing the trial of his people for wise purposes. It is impossible to fix on any historical fulfilment of this prophecy. The details suit neither Maccabean nor Roman times; the attempt to define exactly the period and matter of its accomplishment has proved a failure, and has led to a mingling of events of very different dates, and to a conglomeration of senses literal, metaphorical, and anagogical, which creates confusion while assuming to explain difficulties. The literal interpretation must be resigned, and the whole prophecy must be taken to adumbrate the kingdom of God in its trial, development, and triumph. <span class="cmt_word">Thy spoil shall be divided.</span> Jerusalem is addressed; and the prophet intimates that the enemy shall get possession of the capital, plunder it, and divide its spoil among themselves in its very midst with the greatest security, the inhabitants being wholly at the conquerors' mercy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zechariah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The daughter Zion is to rejoice at this sending of the angel of the Lord. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-10.htm">Zechariah 2:10</a>. "Exult and rejoice, O daughter Zion: for, behold, I come, and dwell in the midst of thee, is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-11.htm">Zechariah 2:11</a>. And many nations will attach themselves to Jehovah in that day, and become a people to me: and I dwell in the midst of thee; and thou wilt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to thee." The daughter Zion, or the church of the Lord, delivered out of Babel, is to rejoice with joy, because her glorification is commencing now. The Lord comes to her in His angel, in whom are His name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>), and His face (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>), i.e., the angel of His face (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>), who reveals His nature, to dwell in the midst of her. This dwelling of Jehovah, or of His angel, in the midst of Zion, is essentially different from the dwelling of Jehovah in the Most Holy Place of His temple. It commences with the coming of the Son of God in the flesh, and is completed by His return in glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>). Then will many, or powerful, nations, attach themselves to Jehovah, and become His people (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-20.htm">Zechariah 8:20-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a>). This kingdom of God, which has hitherto been restricted to Israel, will be spread out and glorified by the reception of the heathen nations which are seeking God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>). The repetition of the expression, "I dwell in the midst of thee," merely serves as a stronger asseveration of this brilliant promise; and the same remark applies to the repetition of &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (and thou shalt now): see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>. Jerusalem will thereby receive the expansion shown to the prophet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>; and through the dwelling of God in the midst of her, the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> will also be fulfilled. The next verse refers to this. </body></html>
