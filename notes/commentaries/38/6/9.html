The exiles who remained in Babylon, showed their regard for the temple that was then building, by sending their gifts and oblations to Jerusalem, for carrying on the work, and adorning the temple after it was built. These offerings, it is to be supposed, they sent about the time when the prophet had this vision, by the persons here named, as they did afterward by Ezra and his companions: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-16.htm" title="And all the silver and gold that you can find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:">Ezra 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/8-25.htm" title="And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:...">Ezra 8:25-26</a>. <span class="ital">And go into the house of Josiah — </span>This was probably one who came from Babylon along with those before mentioned, namely, Heldai, &c.; for in other versions the words, <span class="ital">which are come from Babylon, </span>are put at the end of the verse. <span class="ital">Then take silver and gold — </span>That is, receive from them silver and gold, namely, of that which they had brought for the service of the temple, from those who remained still in Babylon. <span class="ital">And make crowns — </span>“That is, cause to be made by the artist.” — Newcome, who observes that Josiah, above mentioned, was probably a worker in gold and silver. Some versions read, not <span class="ital">crowns, </span>but a <span class="ital">crown. </span>It seems, however, more probable, that “two crowns are here ordered to be made, and both of them to be placed upon the head of Joshua; to signify that the Messiah, the branch, spoken of in the next verse, of whom Joshua was a type, should be both a king and a priest, and so should have a right to wear the two crowns that belonged to these offices. One crown was probably made of silver, and the other of gold; or both silver and gold might be used on the same crown; the silver denoting the human nature of the Messiah, and the gold the divine; or the former the exercise of his offices of priest and king on earth, and the latter the exercise of them in heaven. Or, as some think more probable, both crowns were made of gold, and the silver was employed for some different sacred use, especially as the high-priest’s crown, inscribed with HOLINESS TO THE LORD, was to be entirely made of pure gold.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:9-15 Some Jews from Babylon brought an offering to the house of God. Those who cannot forward a good work by their persons, must, as they are able, forward it by their purses: if some find hands, let others fill them. Crowns are to be made, and put upon the head of Joshua. The sign was used, to make the promise more noticed, that God will, in the fulness of time, raise up a great High Priest, like Joshua, who is but the figure of one that is to come. Christ is not only the Foundation, but the Founder of this temple, by his Spirit and grace. Glory is a burden, but not too heavy for Him to bear who upholds all things. The cross was His glory, and he bore that; so is the crown an exceeding weight of glory, and he bears that. The counsel of peace should be between the priest and the throne, between the priestly and kingly offices of Jesus Christ. The peace and welfare of the gospel church, and of all believers, shall be wrought, though not by two several persons, yet by two several offices meeting in one; Christ, purchasing all peace by his priesthood, maintaining and defending it by his kingdom. The crowns used in this solemnity must be kept in the temple, as evidence of this promise of the Messiah. Let us not think of separating what God has joined in his counsel of peace. We cannot come to God by Christ as our Priest, if we refuse to have him rule over us as our King. We have no real ground to think our peace is made with God, unless we try to keep his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the word of the Lord came to me - The visions being closed, Zechariah marks the change by adopting the usual formula, with which the prophets authenticated, that they spake not of themselves, but by the Spirit of God. The act enjoined is a symbolic act, pointing and summing up and interpreting the visions, as some of the visions had been already expanded by fresh revelations following immediately upon them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Zec 6:9-15.

"Gather yourselves together, and gather together, O nation that dost not grow pale. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>. Before the decree bring forth (the day passes away like chaff), before the burning wrath of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah's wrath come upon you. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-3.htm">Zephaniah 2:3</a>. Seek Jehovah, all ye humble of the land, who have wrought His right; seek righteousness, seek humility, perhaps ye will be hidden in the day of Jehovah's wrath." The summons in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a> is addressed to the whole of Judah or Israel. The verb qo&#772;she&#772;sh, possibly a denom. from qash, signifies to gather stubble (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-7.htm">Exodus 5:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-12.htm">Exodus 5:12</a>), then generally to gather together or collect, e.g., branches of wood (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>); in the hithpoel, to gather one's self together, applied to that spiritual gathering which leads to self-examination, and is the first condition of conversion. The attempts of Ewald and Hitzig to prove, by means of doubtful etymological combinations from the Arabic, that the word possesses the meanings, to grow pale, or to purify one's self, cannot be sustained. The kal is combined with the hiphil for the purpose of strengthening it, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>. Nikhsa&#770;ph is the perf. nipahl in pause, and not a participle, partly because of the &#1500;&#1488; which stands before it (see however Ewald, 286, g), and partly on account of the omission of the article; and nikhsa&#770;ph is to be taken as a relative, "which does not turn pale." Ka&#770;saph has the meaning "to long," both in the niphal (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-30.htm">Genesis 31:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>) and kal (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-15.htm">Job 14:15</a>). This meaning is retained by many here. Thus Jerome renders it, "gens non amabilis, i.e., non desiderata a Deo;" but this is decidedly unsuitable. Others render it "not possessing strong desire," and appeal to the paraphrase of the Chaldee, "a people not wishing to be converted to the law." This is apparently the view upon which the Alex. version rests: &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. But although nikhsa&#770;ph is used to denote the longing of the soul for fellowship with God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>, this idea is not to be found in the word itself, but simply in the object connected with it. We therefore prefer to follow Grotius, Gesenius, Ewald, and others, and take the word in its primary sense of turning pale at anything, becoming white with shame (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>), which is favoured by <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-15.htm">Zephaniah 3:15</a>. The reason for the appeal is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>, viz., the near approach of the judgment. The resolution brings forth, when that which is resolved upon is realized (for ya&#770;lad in this figurative sense, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>). The figure is explained in the second hemistich. The next clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1509; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; does not depend upon &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;&#1501;, for in that case the verb would stand at the head with Vav cop., but it is a parenthesis inserted to strengthen the admonition: the day comes like chaff, i.e., approaches with the greatest rapidity, like chaff driven by the wind: not "the time passes by like chaff" (Hitzig); for it cannot be shown that yo&#772;m was ever used for time in this sense. Yo&#772;m is the day of judgment mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-15</a>; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; here is not to pass by, but to approach, to come near, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>. For the figure of the chaff, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>. In the second &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512;&#1501; is strengthened by &#1500;&#1488;; and &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1488;&#1507;, the burning of wrath in the last clause, is explained by &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1507; &#1497;&#1497;, the day of the revelation of the wrath of God.</body></html>
