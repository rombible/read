Those who cannot forward a good work by their persons, must, as they are able, forward it by their purses: if some find hands, let others fill them. Crowns are to be made, and put upon the head of Joshua. The sign was used, to make the promise more noticed, that God will, in the fulness of time, raise up a great High Priest, like Joshua, who is but the figure of one that is to come. Christ is not only the Foundation, but the Founder of this temple, by his Spirit and grace. Glory is a burden, but not too heavy for Him to bear who upholds all things. The cross was His glory, and he bore that; so is the crown an exceeding weight of glory, and he bears that. The counsel of peace should be between the priest and the throne, between the priestly and kingly offices of Jesus Christ. The peace and welfare of the gospel church, and of all believers, shall be wrought, though not by two several persons, yet by two several offices meeting in one; Christ, purchasing all peace by his priesthood, maintaining and defending it by his kingdom. The crowns used in this solemnity must be kept in the temple, as evidence of this promise of the Messiah. Let us not think of separating what God has joined in his counsel of peace. We cannot come to God by Christ as our Priest, if we refuse to have him rule over us as our King. We have no real ground to think our peace is made with God, unless we try to keep his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take of the captivity - Of that which they had brought with them. "The captivity" was, in Jeremiah ), and Ezekiel E<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24-25</a>, the title of those who had been actually carried captive and were at that moment in captivity. Ezra continues it of those who had been in captivity, though now returned from exile. Yet not without a reference to the circumstances or causes of that captivity. It is the "captivity" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-11.htm">Ezra 1:11</a> which Sheshbazzar brings from Babylon, or Ezra subsequently; the "children of the captivity" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, who set themselves to build the temple of God <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1</a>; who dedicated it and kept the passover . The title is used apparently as an aggravation of sin, like that which had been chastened by that captivity. Here, the term seems to imply some blame, that they remained of their own accord in this state of severance from the altar, where alone special worship of God and sacrifice could be offered. They had been removed against their will; yet, as Christians often do, acquiesced in the loss, rather than forego their temporal advantages. Still they wished to take part in the work of restoring the public worship, and so sent these men, with their contribution of gold and silver, to their brethren, who had returned; as, in the first times of the Gospel, the Christians everywhere made collections for the poor saints, who dwelt in Jerusalem. And this their imperfect zeal was instantly accepted.<p>And go thyself - To make the act more impressive, "on that same day," as matter of urgency, "and thou shalt come to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah, whither they have come from Babylon" . The exiles who had brought presents for the building of the temple, lodged, it seems, in the house of Josiah, whether they doubted or no that their presents would be accepted, since they chose Babylon, not Jerusalem for their abode. This acceptance of their gifts symbolized the incoming of those from afar. It is remarkable that all five names express a relation to God. "Tobiah"  in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1</a>; 3) the Tobias here and 14; 4) Tobit and Tobias in his book), "The Lord is my good;" "Yedaiah," "God knoweth" or "careth for;" Josiah, "The Lord supporteth" ; "Zephaniah," "The Lord hideth," and perhaps "Cheldai," "The Lord's world" . They had taken religious instead of worldly names. Probably Zechariah was first to accept the offerings from the three exiles, and then to take the actual gold from the house of Josiah whither they had brought it. The pilgrims from Babylon and their host are included in one common blessing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Take of them of the captivity&#8212;Take silver and gold (Zec 6:11) from them. The three named came from Babylon (where some of the exiled Jews still were left) to present gifts of silver and gold towards the building of the temple. But in Zec 6:11, 14, "crowns" are directed to be made of them, then to be set on Joshua's head, and to be deposited in the temple as a memorial of the donors, until Messiah shall appear.<p>Heldai&#8212;meaning "robust."

Therefore, Moore thinks Josiah as well as the three "came from Babylon." But as he has a "house" at Jerusalem, he is plainly a resident, not a visitor. Therefore English Version is right; or Maurer, "Josiah son of Zephaniah, to whom they are come (as guests) from Babylon."<p>the same day&#8212;No time was to be lost to mark the significancy of their coming from afar to offer gifts to the temple, typifying, in the double crown made of their gifts and set on Joshua's head, the gathering in of Israel's outcasts to Messiah hereafter, who shall then be recognized as the true king and priest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Take, </span> gold and silver, of those that are come out of Babylon lately, to make their oblation to the Lord, or to bring the oblation of them who yet were in Babylon, but remembered Jerusalem and the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And come thou; </span> go fetch them if they lodge elsewhere, and bring them in thy company. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The same day; </span> the same day in which they come, or else in the same day that I speak unto thee, delay not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And go into the house of Josiah:</span> some say he was a goldsmith, others, that he was treasurer for the temple, and that these persons before named had brought a rich present to him for the temple and the service of the Lord. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zechariah/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Take of "them of" the captivity,....

But there is no reason whatever to suppose that the Jews who were rebuilding the temple had ever any scruple about receiving such offerings even from heathens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-4.htm" title="And whoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/1-6.htm" title="And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered....">Ezra 1:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/6-8.htm" title="Moreover I make a decree what you shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, immediately expenses be given to these men, that they be not hindered....">Ezra 6:8-10</a>), so that such a direction would have been superfluous.

The humble (&#8219;a&#774;na&#770;v&#305;&#772;m) are described as those who do Jehovah's right, i.e., who seek diligently to fulfil what Jehovah has prescribed in the law as right. Accordingly, seeking Jehovah is explained as seeking righteousness and humility. The thought is this: they are to strive still more zealously after Jehovah's right, viz., righteousness and humility (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-20.htm">Deuteronomy 16:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7</a>); then will they probably be hidden in the day of wrath, i.e., be pardoned and saved (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-15.htm">Amos 5:15</a>). This admonition is now still further enforced from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a> onwards by the announcement of the coming of judgment upon all the heathen, that the kingdom of God may attain completion. </body></html>
