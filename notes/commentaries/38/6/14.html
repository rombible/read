Those who cannot forward a good work by their persons, must, as they are able, forward it by their purses: if some find hands, let others fill them. Crowns are to be made, and put upon the head of Joshua. The sign was used, to make the promise more noticed, that God will, in the fulness of time, raise up a great High Priest, like Joshua, who is but the figure of one that is to come. Christ is not only the Foundation, but the Founder of this temple, by his Spirit and grace. Glory is a burden, but not too heavy for Him to bear who upholds all things. The cross was His glory, and he bore that; so is the crown an exceeding weight of glory, and he bears that. The counsel of peace should be between the priest and the throne, between the priestly and kingly offices of Jesus Christ. The peace and welfare of the gospel church, and of all believers, shall be wrought, though not by two several persons, yet by two several offices meeting in one; Christ, purchasing all peace by his priesthood, maintaining and defending it by his kingdom. The crowns used in this solemnity must be kept in the temple, as evidence of this promise of the Messiah. Let us not think of separating what God has joined in his counsel of peace. We cannot come to God by Christ as our Priest, if we refuse to have him rule over us as our King. We have no real ground to think our peace is made with God, unless we try to keep his commandments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the crowns shall be to Helem - There is no ground apparent to us, why the name "Helem" appears instead of "Holdai" , or "Hen" for "Josiah:" yet the same person must have been called both Hen and Josiah, since the father's name is the same in both places. They cannot both be intended as explanations of the former names, since Helem stands insulated in Hebrew, its meaning conjectural.

Rup.: "This is what we look for, that to all the saints and friends of God, whom these signify, those crowns which they made of their gold and silver for the Lord Jesus, shall be an everlasting memorial in that heavenly temple of the Lord." The tradition of the Jews, that this was literally, observed , can hardly be without foundation. Cyril: "These their offerings shall be for grace to those who dedicated them and an occasion of doxology. For the piety of princes becomes to the rest a path to the love of God.

That such "gifts" were dedicated in the temple is well known (see Judith 16:19; 2 Macc. 5:16 2Macc. 9:16; Josephus, 'Bell.

This is the simplest explanation of the variously interpreted kero&#772;th (as an inf. of ka&#770;ra&#770;h, to dig), and can be grammatically sustained. The digging of the shepherds stands for the excavations which they make. Bochart (Hieroz. i. p. 519, ed. Ros.) has already given this explanation: "Caulae s. caulis repletus erit effossionis pastorum, i.e., caulae a pastoribus effossae in cryptis subterraneis ad vitandum solis aestum." On the other hand, the derivation from the noun ke&#772;ra&#770;h, in the sense of cistern, cannot be sustained; and there is no proof of it in the fact that ka&#770;ra&#770;h is applied to the digging of wells. Still less is it possible to maintain the derivation from &#1497;&#1499;&#1512; (Arab. wkr), by which Ewald would support the meaning nests for ke&#772;ro&#772;th, i.e., "the small houses or carts of the shepherds." And Hitzig's alteration of the text into &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, pastures, so as to obtain the tautology "meadows of the pastures," is perfectly unwarranted. The word chebhel is construed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a> as a feminine ad sensum, with a retrospective allusion to 'erets Pelisht&#305;&#772;m; whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a> it is construed, as it is everywhere else, as a masculine. Moreover, the noun chebhel, which occurs in this verse without the article, is not the subject; for, if it were, it would at least have had the article. It is rather a predicate, and the subject must be supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a> : "The Philistian tract of land by the sea will become a tract of land or possession for the remnant of the house of Judah, the portion of the people of God rescued from the judgment. Upon them, viz., these pastures, will they feed." The plural &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; does not stand for the neuter, but is occasioned by a retrospective glance at &#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;. The subject is, those that are left of the house of Judah. They will there feed their flocks, and lie down in the huts of Ashkelon. For the prophet adds by way of explanation, Jehovah their God will visit them. Pa&#770;qad, to visit in a good sense, i.e., to take them under His care, as is almost always the meaning when it is construed with an accusative of the person. It is only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a> that it is used with an acc. pers. instead of with &#1506;&#1500;, in the sense of to chastise or punish. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>. The keri &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; has arisen from a misinterpretation. On the fulfilment, see what follows. </body></html>
