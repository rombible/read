Those have their minds wofully blinded, who do ill, and justify themselves in it; but God will not hold those guiltless who hold themselves so. How can we go to God to beg a blessing on unlawful methods of getting wealth, or to return thanks for success in them? There was a general decay of religion among them, and they regarded it not. The Good Shepherd would feed his flock, but his attention would chiefly be directed to the poor. As an emblem, the prophet seems to have taken two staves; Beauty, denoted the privileges of the Jewish nation, in their national covenant; the other he called Bands, denoting the harmony which hitherto united them as the flock of God. But they chose to cleave to false teachers. The carnal mind and the friendship of the world are enmity to God; and God hates all the workers of iniquity: it is easy to foresee what this will end in. The prophet demanded wages, or a reward, and received thirty pieces of silver. By Divine direction he cast it to the potter, as in disdain for the smallness of the sum. This shadowed forth the bargain of Judas to betray Christ, and the final method of applying it. Nothing ruins a people so certainly, as weakening the brotherhood among them. This follows the dissolving of the covenant between God and them: when sin abounds, love waxes cold, and civil contests follow. No wonder if those fall out among themselves, who have provoked God to fall out with them. Wilful contempt of Christ is the great cause of men's ruin. And if professors rightly valued Christ, they would not contend about little matters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I will no more pity - Therefore were they a "flock of the slaughter," because God would "have no pity" on those who went after shepherds "who had no Pity" upon them, but corrupted them; who "entered not in themselves, and those who were entering in, they hindered" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>.<p>The inhabitants of the land - "That land, of which he had been speaking," Judaea.

"Hear, O Jew," says Jerome, "who holdest out to thyself hopes most vain, and hearest not the Lord strongly asserting, "I will not deliver them out of their hands," that thy captivity among the Romans shall have no end." In the threatened captivity before they were carried to Babylon, the prophet foretold the restoration: here only it is said of Judah, as Hosea had said of lsrael, that there should be no deliverer out of the hand of the king whom they had chosen. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Jehovah’s displeasure, and interprets the parable of the flock. They of whom I am speaking are “the inhabitants of the land (of Judæa);” they are not sheep but “men.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-31.htm" title="And you my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 34:31</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of the land</span>. It is a question whether by this expression is meant the Israelites, or the dwellers on earth generally. In the former ease, the verso gives the reason of the calamities depicted in ver. 5, viz. God's displeasure, and expounds the parable of the sheep as meaning men (so Cheyne). In the other case, the signification of the paragraph is that God intends to put an end to the state of things just described, by punishing the oppressing world powers who had so cruelly executed their office of being instruments of God's judgment on his people. The latter seems the correct exposition; for the people of Israel have just been called the flock of slaughter, and they were to be fed, while these "inhabitants" are to be destroyed; nor could the Israelites be said to have kings, as just below. Thus for, at the beginning of the verse, introduces the reason why Jehovah tells the shepherd to feed the flock, because he is about to punish their oppressors; and "the inhabitants of the land" should be "the inhabitants of the earth;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nations of the world, among whom the Israelites lived. <span class="cmt_word">I will deliver the men,</span> etc. God will give up the nations to intestine commotions and civil war, so that they shall fall by mutual slaughter. <span class="cmt_word">Into the hand of his king.</span> Each of them shall be delivered over helpless unto their tyrant's hands, and God will not interpose to succour them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zechariah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Three months after his call to be a prophet through the first word of God that was addressed to him, Zechariah received a comprehensive revelation concerning the future fate of the people and kingdom of God, in a series of visions, which were given him to behold in a single night, and were interpreted by an angel. This took place, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a>, "on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, i.e., the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius," that is to say, exactly five months after the building of the temple had been resumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>), with which fact the choice of the day for the divine revelation was evidently connected, and two months after the last promise issued through Haggai to the people, that the Lord would from henceforth bless His nation, and would glorify it in the future (<a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-10.htm">Haggai 2:10-23</a>). To set forth in imagery this blessing and glorification, and to exhibit the leading features of the future conformation of the kingdom of God, was the object of these visions, which are designated in the introduction as "word of Jehovah," because the pictures seen in the spirit, together with their interpretation, had the significance of verbal revelations, and are to some extent still further explained by the addition of words of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-13</a>). As they were shown to the prophet one after another in a single night, so that in all probability only short pauses intervened between the different views; so did they present a substantially connected picture of the future of Israel, which was linked on to the then existing time, and closed with the prospect of the ultimate completion of the kingdom of God. </body></html>
