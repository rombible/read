And I took to me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.">Zechariah 11:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">And — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">but, I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you</span> — Or, especially you, <span class="ital">O poor of the flock — </span>Zechariah here, representing Christ the true shepherd, says, he will enter upon his office, and undertake the care of the flock appointed for the slaughter; <span class="ital">even you, O poor of the flock — </span>This clause is explicatory of the former, and by the repetition of it we are shown, that God, in his charge to the prophet, as a type of Christ, and to Christ the antitype, distinguishes clearly between different sorts of people among the Jews; between those that were poor, despised, weak, and humble, and those that were tyrannical, proud, and cruel, and made a prey of their inferiors: these were left out of the pastoral charge; the others were to be taken care of. <span class="ital">And I took unto me two staves — </span>These were the proper accoutrements of a shepherd, and these the prophet assumed as a badge of his office, and gave them significant names, which are partly explained, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/11-10.htm" title="And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people....">Zechariah 11:10-14</a>. “The shepherds of old time,” says Lowth, “had two rods, or staves, one turned round at the top, that it might not hurt the sheep: this was for counting them, and separating the sound from the diseased, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-32.htm" title="And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:32</a>; the other had an iron hook at the end of it, to pull in and hold the straying sheep. The psalmist mentions both these, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm" title="Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.">Psalm 23:4</a>, <span class="ital">Thy rod and thy staff comfort me.” The one I called Beauty</span> — Or, <span class="ital">pleasantness, </span>or, <span class="ital">delight, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">נועם</span>may be rendered, signifying, says Lowth, his favour, gentleness, or kindness toward his people; which was remarkably verified in Christ, whose gracious words, and beneficial works, were conspicuous through the whole course of his life. <span class="ital">The other I called Bands </span>— Which the same author interprets of the <span class="ital">bond of the new covenant, </span>whereby he intended to unite both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah under himself, as their head and king, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-22.htm" title="And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.">Ezekiel 37:22</a>; and then afterward to unite the Jews and the Gentiles into one church, by breaking down the partition wall that was between them. Newcome considers the former, <span class="ital">Beauty, </span>as intended to “denote how beautiful and pleasant the land would have been, if its inhabitants had kept their covenant with God.” The other, <span class="ital">Bands, </span>“ as signifying the union which ought to have subsisted between Judah and Israel.” Mr. Scott explains “the former word of the honour, privilege, and ornament which the Jews possessed, according to their national covenant, in the oracles, instituted worship, and temple of God; and especially by the ministry of Christ and his apostles, who preached the gospel to them first.” The other, he thinks, means, “the connection of the nation under one government, and the harmony that had, in some measure, hitherto united them, as the flock of God.” Many other interpretations are given of these two names, but as they all are, and must be, in a great measure, founded on conjecture, the reader is not here troubled with them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:4-14 Christ came into this world for judgment to the Jewish church and nation, which were wretchedly corrupt and degenerate. Those have their minds wofully blinded, who do ill, and justify themselves in it; but God will not hold those guiltless who hold themselves so. How can we go to God to beg a blessing on unlawful methods of getting wealth, or to return thanks for success in them? There was a general decay of religion among them, and they regarded it not. The Good Shepherd would feed his flock, but his attention would chiefly be directed to the poor. As an emblem, the prophet seems to have taken two staves; Beauty, denoted the privileges of the Jewish nation, in their national covenant; the other he called Bands, denoting the harmony which hitherto united them as the flock of God. But they chose to cleave to false teachers. The carnal mind and the friendship of the world are enmity to God; and God hates all the workers of iniquity: it is easy to foresee what this will end in. The prophet demanded wages, or a reward, and received thirty pieces of silver. By Divine direction he cast it to the potter, as in disdain for the smallness of the sum. This shadowed forth the bargain of Judas to betray Christ, and the final method of applying it. Nothing ruins a people so certainly, as weakening the brotherhood among them. This follows the dissolving of the covenant between God and them: when sin abounds, love waxes cold, and civil contests follow. No wonder if those fall out among themselves, who have provoked God to fall out with them. Wilful contempt of Christ is the great cause of men's ruin. And if professors rightly valued Christ, they would not contend about little matters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophetic narrative which follows, differs in its form, in some respects, from the symbolical actions of the prophets and from Zechariah's own visions. The symbolical actions of the prophets are actions of their own: this involves acts, which it would be impossible to represent, except as a sort of drama. Such are the very central points, the feeding of the flock, which are still intelligent people who understand God's doings: the cutting off of the three shepherds; the asking for the price; the unworthy price offered; the casting it aside. It differs from Zechariah's own visions, in that they are for the most part exhibited to the eye, and Zechariah's own part is simply to enquire their meaning and to learn it, and to receive further revelation. In one case only, he himself interposes in the action of the vision <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-10</a> :15; but this too, as asking that it might be done, not, as himself doing it. Here, he is himself the actor, yet as representing Another, who alone could cut off shepherds, abandon the people to mutual destruction, annulling the covenant which He had made. Maimonides, then, seems to say rightly; : "This, "I fed the flock of the slaughter," to the end of the narrative, where he is said to have asked for his hire, to have received it, and to have cast it into the temple, to the treasurer, all this Zechariah saw in prophetic vision. For the command which he received, and the act which he is said to have done, took place in prophetic vision or dream." "This," he adds, "is beyond controversy, as all know, who are able to distinguish the possible from the impossible."<p>Osorius: "The actions, presented to the prophets are not always to be understood as actions but as predictions. As when God commands Isaiah, to make the heart of the people dull <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a> that is, to denounce to the people their future blindness, through which they would, with obstinate mind, reject the mercies of Christ. Or when He says, that He appointed Jeremiah Jer 1:10 to destroy and to build; to root out and to plant. Or when He commanded the same prophet to cause the nations to drink the cup, whereby they should be bereft of their senses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a> ff), Jeremiah did nothing of all this, but asserted that it would be. So here."<p>And I will feed the flock of the slaughter - Rather And (our, so) "I fed." The prophet declares, in the name of our Lord, that He did what the Father commanded Him. He fed the flock, committed to His care by the Father, who, through their own obstinacy, became "the flock of slaughter." What could be done, He did for them; so that all might see that they perished by their own fault. The symbol of our Lord, as the Good Shepherd, had been made prominent by Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, "Behold the Lord will come, as a Mighty One - He shall feed His flock like a shepherd: He shall gather the lambs with His arm and carry them in His bosom: He shall gently lead those that are with young" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10-11</a>. And Jeremiah, having declared God's judgments on the then shepherds <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>, "I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their fold; and they shall be fruitful and increase. And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a king shall reign and prosper - and this is the name whereby He shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness" <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3-6</a>. And Ezekiel with the like context <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-1.htm">Ezekiel 34:1-21</a>; "Therefore will I save My flock and they shall be no more a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. And I will set One Shepherd over them, and He shall feed them: My servant David, He shall feed them; and He shall be their Shepherd" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-22.htm">Ezekiel 34:22-23</a>; and, uniting both offices, "David, My servant, shall be king over them, and they shall all have One Shepherd" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. It was apparent then beforehand, who this Shepherd was to be, to whom God gave the feeding of the flock.<p>"Even 'you,' or 'for you, ye poor of the flock;' or, 'therefore,' being thus commanded, (fed I) the poor of the flock". The whole flock was committed to Him to feed. He had to seek out all "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>. Dionysius: "He fed, for the time, the Jews destined to death, until their time should come;" the fruit of His labor was in the "little flock" <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>, "the faithful Jews who believed in Him, out of the people of the flock aforesaid, or the synagogue, who in the primitive Church despised all earthly things, leading a most pure life." So He says, "I will feed My flock and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God: I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong, I will feed them with judgment" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-15.htm">Ezekiel 34:15-16</a>.<p>The elect are the end of all God's dispensations. He fed all; yet the fruit of His feeding, His toils, His death, the travail of His soul, was in those only who are saved. So Paul says, "Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>. He fed all; but the "poor of the flock" alone, those who were despised of men, because they would not follow the pride of the high priests and scribes and Pharisees, believed on Him, as they themselves say, "Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed on Him?" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>, and Paul says, "Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty; and base things of the world, and things despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-28</a>.<p>And I took unto Me two - (shepherd's) staves as David says, "Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>. "The one I called Beauty or Loveliness" , as the Psalmist longs to "behold the beauty or loveliness" of God in His temple <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>, and says; let "the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>.<p>And the other I called Bands - Literally, "Binders" . The one staff represents the full favor and loving-kindness of God; when this was broken, there yet remained the other, by which they were held together as a people in covenant with God. "And I fed the flock." This was the use of his staves; He tended them with both, ever putting in exercise toward them the loving beauty and grace of God, and binding them together and with Himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. And&#8212;rather, "Accordingly": implying the motive cause which led Messiah to assume the office, namely, the will of the Father (Zec 11:4, 5), who pitied the sheep without any true shepherd.<p>I will feed&#8212;"I fed" [Calvin], which comes to the same thing, as the past tense must in Zechariah's time have referred to the event of Messiah's advent then future: the prophets often speaking of the future in vision as already present. It was not My fault, Jehovah implies, that these sheep were not fed; the fault rests solely with you, because ye rejected the grace of God [Calvin].<p>even you, O poor of the flock&#8212;rather, "in order that (I might feed, that is, save) the poor (humble; compare Zec 11:11; Zep 3:12; Mt 5:3) of the flock"; literally, not you, but, "therefore (I will feed)" [Moore]. See Margin, "Verily the poor." It is for the sake of the believing remnant that Messiah took charge of the flock, though He would have saved all, if they would have come to Him. They would not come; therefore, as a nation, they are "the flock of (that is, doomed to) slaughter."<p>I took &#8230; two staves&#8212;that is, shepherds' staves or rods (Ps 23:4). Symbolizing His assumption of the pastor's office.<p>Beauty&#8212;The Jews' peculiar excellency above other nations (De 4:7), God's special manifestation to them (Ps 147:19, 20), the glory of the temple ("the beauty of holiness," Ps 29:2; compare Ps 27:4; 90:17; 2Ch 20:21), the "pleasantness" of their land (Ge 49:15; Da 8:9; 11:16), "the glorious land."<p>Bands&#8212;implying the bond of "brotherhood" between Judah and Israel. "Bands," in Ps 119:61, Margin, is used for confederate companies: The Easterns in making a confederacy often tie a cord or band as a symbol of it, and untie it when they dissolve the confederacy [Ludovicus De Dieu]. Messiah would have joined Judah and Israel in the bonds of a common faith and common laws (Zec 11:14), but they would not; therefore in just retribution He broke "His covenant which He had made with all the people." Alexander, Antiochus Epiphanes, and Pompey were all kept from marring utterly the distinctive "beauty" and "brotherhood" of Judah and Israel, which subsisted more or less so long as the temple stood. But when Jehovah brake the staves, not even Titus could save the temple from his own Roman soldiery, nor was Jurian able to restore it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And, </span> or <span class="ital">But</span>, as the Hebrew particle is sometimes read: As for the greatest part, they are so corrupt and obstinately disobedient, I will cast them off; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">but I will feed, </span>& c.

Or, say others, to note his singular care and diligence in his office; when other shepherds content themselves with one, Christ takes two. Or what if hereby Christ would be provided with one to guide the flock, with another to repel such as would slaughter them, to protect against violence and to direct such as are meek.

According to the call and commission he had from his divine Father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-4.htm">Zechariah 11:4</a> he determines to do as it was enjoined him, and as he had undertook: <p>even you, O poor of the flock; besides the people of the Jews in general, to whom Christ was sent, and he came to feed, there were a small remnant, according to the election of grace, he had a special regard for; and whom he fed by the word and ordinances with himself, the bread of life; and with the discoveries of his love, and with the covenant of grace, its blessings and promises, the sure mercies of David. These are called "the poor of the flock", because they were the poor of this world, as were the disciples and followers of Christ; "the poor have the Gospel preached unto them"; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a> and because they were spiritually poor, or poor in spirit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a> who saw their spiritual poverty, and owned it; who bewailed it, and were humbled under a sense of it; and sought after the true riches; and acknowledged that all they had were owing to the grace of God: and who, as to the frame of their mind, are the meek and humble ones; or, as to their outward state and condition, afflicted ones, as the word (y) may be rendered; who were persecuted, reviled, reproached, and accursed by others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-49.htm">John 7:49</a> and, as to their gifts and graces, the meanest of God's people: <p>And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; Jarchi, agreeably to the Targum, interprets this of the division of the kingdom of Israel into two parts, in the times of Rehoboam and Jeroboam. Some think persons are meant. In the Talmud (z) it is explained of the disciples of the wise men in the land of Israel, who make each other pleasant by their doctrines; and of the disciples of the wise men in Babylon that corrupt one another, or object to one another: according to Aben Ezra, Zerubbabel and Nehemiah are intended: others, the good king Josiah, and the bad king Zedekiah: others the priest, and the king, as Abendana observes; and Kimchi explains it of the different manner in which the Lord led the people, according to their behaviour to him; when they behaved well, they had good kings and governors, which led them in a right way, and they were filled with good things; but when they behaved otherwise they had evil kings, and evil befell them. The first of these staves some render "clemency" (a) lenity, kindness, gentleness; and suppose it has respect to the kind and gentle manner in which God dealt with the Jews before the times of Christ, both as to civil and religious things; as to civil things, by bringing them into and settling them in a pleasant land, a land flowing with milk and honey; by giving them wholesome laws, by which they were governed, such as no other nation had; and by setting over them judges, to protect, defend, and deliver them; and kings to rule over them, very wise and good, especially some of them, David, Solomon, &amp;c.: and as to religious things, by giving them a revelation of his mind and will, his word, statutes, and judgments, he did not give to other nations; and by sending prophets to instruct them in them, and stir them up to the observance of them; and by appointing a place of worship, and settling the form of it; setting apart men to the office of priests, and ordering sacrifices to be offered, with the whole of temple service; which were the beauty of the Lord, to be beheld in his sanctuary: and then the latter, called "Bands", which some render destroyers (b), may denote either the destruction of this people, when they sinned against God, either by the Chaldeans or by the Romans; when severity was exercised on them, and wrath came upon them to the uttermost, in the ruin of their nation, city, and temple: and others think these may refer to the different usage of the Roman emperors, with respect to the Jews, who, for the most part, used them kindly, until the times of Nero; but afterwards, by him and other emperors, they were treated very roughly, until they were utterly destroyed by them; but as it plainly appears from the context that this is spoken of no other shepherd but Christ, and of no other feeding but his, they must design the instruments he makes use of, and still continues to make use of, in feeding his people. Shepherds commonly have but one staff, rod, or crook; but Christ has two: so the psalmist makes mention of a "rod" and "staff", when speaking of Christ as a Shepherd, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> and these two staves some interpret of his twofold way of government, lenity to his people, and severity to his enemies; but rather it denotes the very great diligence and care Christ takes of his flock, both in guiding and directing them, and in protecting and defending them from their enemies: he fed his people in his own person when here on earth, with his staff "Beauty", or "clemency"; he was sent, and came to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and had great compassion on them, as being like sheep without a shepherd; their present shepherds, or who bore that name, being such as are before described: and his tenderness and gentleness towards them appeared in his calling sinners to repentance; in his gracious invitations to come unto him; by his kind reception of them; his affable and courteous deportment towards them; the gentle reproofs and suitable instructions he gave them, and the comfortable truths of the Gospel he delivered to them; and, during his personal ministry, he suffered his disciples to go nowhere else with his Gospel; and, at his resurrection from the dead, ordered them to begin preaching at Jerusalem, and to continue preaching to the Jews first everywhere, as they did, until they rejected the Gospel; and then Christ broke both his staves, or removed the Gospel, and the ordinances of it, which I think are meant by these staves: for these staves are not only ensigns of the shepherd, as instruments of guiding, directing, and protecting the flock; but emblematical, as their names show; and emblems they might be of the stay and staff of food, of the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a> and we find that Christ's rod and staff, in a mystical sense, are of use to feed, refresh, and comfort, as well as to guide and direct, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> by the staff "Beauty" we are to understand the Gospel, which was preached to the Jews before the destruction of Jerusalem, which is beautiful and pleasant in itself; the doctrines of it are so, such as those of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation by Christ; and such are the promises of it, being absolute and unconditional, sure and suitable to the cases of God's people, and likewise its ministers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a> and the ordinances of it comely and lovely; and besides, it sets forth the beauty of Christ, and represents the saints' beautifulness in him; and it is like the shepherd's staff; of great use in feeding the flock, not only by supplying with food, being food itself, milk for babes, and meat for strong men; and by directing to Christ, his covenant and church, where it is to be had; but by setting right such who are going in wrong pastures; pushing forward such as are backward to duty; fetching back such as are driven away, or backslidden, and preserving the whole from wolves and bears: and by the other staff, "Bands", the ordinances of the Gospel are designed, which are of use to keep the saints together, and to direct them to proper food; particularly the ordinance of the Lord's supper, which, as it is a feeding ordinance, and sets forth Christ, as food for faith, his flesh which is meat indeed, and his blood which is drink indeed; so it is a knitting and uniting ordinance, and is fitly expressed by "bands"; is not only a means of knitting the affections to Christ, whose love is so fully expressed in it; but of uniting the hearts of believers to one another, who herein become one bread, and one body, and feed together; and have communion with each other, and maintain their church state in a comfortable manner; and keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace; and the ordinances of the Gospel, though they are such bonds as are disagreeable to graceless persons, who are for breaking them asunder; yet they are a yoke that is easy, and a burden light to the people of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm">Psalm 2:3</a>. It may be observed, that the word for "bands" is rendered "pilots", <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a> and masters or governors of ships, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-6.htm">Jonah 1:6</a> and is so rendered here (c); and as churches may be compared to ships, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-9.htm">Revelation 8:9</a> so may ministers of the word to those who have the government and direction of them; and whose business lies in the ministration of the word, and the administration of ordinances, and taking care of the discipline of the Gospel: this seems to be the evangelic sense of these words; and they express the manner in which Christ fed his own dear people in Judea, partly by his own ministry, and partly by the ministry of his apostles, while he had an interest there, until the sins of that nation brought utter ruin upon them. It is a most ridiculous application made of these two staves by Antoninus, archbishop of Florence (d), that Zechariah, being of the Dominican order, took to him in the person of God two staves; the one he called "Beauty", which is the order of the preaching Friars; and the other "Bands", which is the order of the Minors: <p>and I fed the flock; with the said staves, as he had determined; which includes the doing of the whole office of a shepherd; taking an exact account of his sheep, that none be lost; going before them, and setting them an example in the exercise of grace and discharge of duty; leading them to the still waters of his Father's love; to the fountains and fulness of his own grace; to the rich provisions of his house, and the green pastures of Gospel ordinances; feeding them himself, and with himself, the bread of life, the hidden and heavenly manna; appointing shepherds under him, whom he qualifies to be pastors, gives them to his churches as such, and who receive from him the doctrines of the Gospel to feed them with; and protecting them from all their enemies, the roaring lion, Satan, wolves in sheep's clothing, false teachers, and the world's goats, who thrust with side and shoulder, and push with their horns of power; as well as by seeking that which is lost; bringing back that which is driven, or drawn away; binding up that which is broken; strengthening the weak; healing the sick; and watching over the whole flock night and day, lest any hurt them. <p>(y) "mites de grege", Grotius; "afflictos pecoris", Montanus; "afflictos gregis", Burkius.

"I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtles which were in the hollow; and behind him red, speckled, and white horses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>. And I said, What are these, my lord? Then the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these are. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>. And the man who stood among the myrtles answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to go through the earth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>. And they answered the angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtles, and said, We have gone through the earth, and, behold, the whole earth sits still, and at rest. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a>. Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have compassion upon Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with whom Thou hast been angry these seventy years? <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a>. And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words, comforting words. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>. And the angel that talked with me said to me, Preach, and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have been jealous for Jerusalem and Zion with great jealousy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a> and with great wrath I am angry against the nations at rest: for I had been angry for a little, but they helped for harm. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>. Therefore thus saith Jehovah, I turn again to Jerusalem with compassion: my house shall be built in it, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, and the measuring line shall be drawn over Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>. Preach as yet, and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, My cities shall yet swell over with good, and Jehovah will yet comfort Zion, and will yet choose Jerusalem." The prophet sees, during the night of the day described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a> (&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; is the accusative of duration), in an ecstatic vision, not in a dream but in a waking condition, a rider upon a red horse in a myrtle-bush, stopping in a deep hollow, and behind him a number of riders upon red, speckled, and white horses (su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m are horses with riders, and the reason why the latter are not specially mentioned is that they do not appear during the course of the vision as taking any active part, whilst the colour of their horses is the only significant feature). At the same time he also sees, in direct proximity to himself, an angel who interprets the vision, and farther off (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>) the angel of Jehovah also standing or stopping among the myrtle-bushes, and therefore in front of the man upon a red horse, to whom the riders bring a report, that they have gone through the earth by Jehovah's command and have found the whole earth quiet and at rest; whereupon the angel of Jehovah addresses a prayer to Jehovah for pity upon Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and receives a good consolatory answer, which the interpreting angel conveys to the prophet, and the latter publicly proclaims in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-17</a>.<p>The rider upon the red horse is not to be identified with the angel of Jehovah, nor the latter with the angelus interpres. It is true that the identity of the rider and the angel of Jehovah, which many commentators assume, is apparently favoured by the circumstance that they are both standing among the myrtles (&#8219;o&#772;me&#772;d, stood; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>); but all that follows from this is that the rider stopped at the place where the angel of Jehovah was standing, i.e., in front of him, to present a report to him of the state of the earth, which he had gone through with his retinue. This very circumstance rather favours the diversity of the two, inasmuch as it is evident from this that the rider upon the red horse was simply the front one, or leader of the whole company, who is brought prominently forward as the spokesman and reporter. If the man upon the red horse had been the angel of Jehovah Himself, and the troop of horsemen had merely come to bring information to the man upon the red horse, the troop of horsemen could not have stood behind him, but would have stood either opposite to him or in front of him. And the different epithets applied to the two furnish a decisive proof that the angel of the Lord and "the angel that talked with me" are not one and the same. The angel, who gives or conveys to the prophet the interpretation of the vision, is constantly called "the angel that talked with me," not only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>, where it is preceded by an address on the part of the prophet to this same angel, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>, and in the visions which follow (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-2.htm">Zechariah 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-4.htm">Zechariah 4:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-5.htm">Zechariah 5:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-10.htm">Zechariah 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-4.htm">Zechariah 6:4</a>), from which it is perfectly obvious that &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; denotes the function which this angel performs in these visions (dibber be, signifying the speaking of God or of an angel within a man, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). His occupation, therefore, was to interpret the visions to the prophet, and convey the divine revelations, so that he was only an angelus interpres or collocutor. This angel appears in the other visions in company with other angels, and receives instructions from them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5-8</a>); and his whole activity is restricted to the duty of conveying higher instructions to the prophet, and giving him an insight into the meaning of the visions, whereas the angel of Jehovah stands on an equality with God, being sometimes identified with Jehovah, and at other times distinguished from Him. (Compare the remarks upon this subject in the comm. on Genesis, Pent. pp. 118ff.) In the face of these facts, it is impossible to establish the identity of the two by the arguments that have been adduced in support of it. It by no means follows from <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a>, where the prophet addresses the mediator as "my lord," that the words are addressed to the angel of the Lord; for neither he nor the angelus interpres has been mentioned before; and in the visions persons are frequently introduced as speaking, according to their dramatic character, without having been mentioned before, so that it is only from what they say or do that it is possible to discover who they are. Again, the circumstance that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a> the angel of the Lord presents a petition to the Supreme God on behalf of the covenant nation, and that according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a> Jehovah answers the angelus interpres in good, comforting words, does not prove that he who receives the answer must be the same person as the intercessor: for it might be stated in reply to this, as it has been by Vitringa, that Zechariah has simply omitted to mention that the answer was first of all addressed to the angel of the Lord, and that it was through him that it reached the mediating angel; or we might assume, as Hengstenberg has done, that "Jehovah addressed the answer directly to the mediating angel, because the angel of the Lord had asked the question, not for his own sake, but simply for the purpose of conveying consolation and hope through the mediator to the prophet, and through him to the nation generally."<p>There is no doubt that, in this vision, both the locality in which the rider upon the red horse, with his troop, and the angel of the Lord had taken up their position, and also the colour of the horses, are significant. But they are neither of them easy to interpret. Even the meaning of metsulla&#770;h is questionable. Some explain it as signifying a "shady place," from &#1510;&#1500;, a shadow; but in that case we should expect the form metsilla&#770;h. There is more authority for the assumption that metsulla&#770;h is only another form for metsu&#772;la&#770;h, which is the reading in many codd., and which ordinarily stands for the depth of the sea, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a> tsa&#770;lal signifies to sink into the deep. The Vulgate adopts this rendering: in profundo. Here it signifies, in all probability, a deep hollow, possibly with water in it, as myrtles flourish particularly well in damp soils and by the side of rivers (see Virgil, Georg. ii. 112, iv. 124). The article in bammetsulla&#770;h defines the hollow as the one which the prophet saw in the vision, not the ravine of the fountain of Siloah, as Hofmann supposes (Weissagung u. Erfllung, i. p. 333). The hollow here is not a symbol of the power of the world, or the abyss-like power of the kingdoms of the world (Hengstenberg and M. Baumgarten), as the author of the Chaldee paraphrase in Babele evidently thought; for this cannot be proved from such passages as <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1-1215:59</a>Isa <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/44-27.htm">Zechariah 44:27</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-24.htm">Psalm 107:24</a>. In the myrtle-bushes, or myrtle grove, we have no doubt a symbol of the theocracy, or of the land of Judah as a land that was dear and lovely in the estimation of the Lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-16.htm">Daniel 11:16</a>), for the myrtle is a lovely ornamental plant. Hence the hollow in which the myrtle grove was situated, can only be a figurative representation of the deep degradation into which the land and people of God had fallen at that time. There is a great diversity of opinion as to the significance of the colour of the horses, although all the commentators agree that the colour is significant, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>., and that this is the only reason why the horses are described according to their colours, and the riders are not mentioned at all. About two of the colours there is no dispute. &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;, red, the colour of the blood; and &#1500;&#1489;&#1503;, white, brilliant white, the reflection of heavenly and divine glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>), hence the symbol of a glorious victory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>). The meaning of seruqq&#305;&#772;m is a disputed one. The lxx have rendered it &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-3.htm">Zechariah 6:3</a>; the Itala and Vulgate, varii; the Peshito, versicolores. Hence su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m seruqq&#305;&#772;m would correspond to the &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>. The word seruqq&#305;&#772;m only occurs again in the Old Testament in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, where it is applied to the tendrils or branches of the vine, for which so&#772;re&#772;q (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>) or sere&#772;qa&#770;h (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>) is used elsewhere. On the other hand, Gesenius (Thes. s.v.) and others defend the meaning red, after the Arabic as&#780;qaru, the red horse, the fox, from s&#780;aqira, to be bright red; and Koehler understands by su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m seruqq&#305;&#772;m, bright red, fire-coloured, or bay horses. But this meaning cannot be shown to be in accordance with Hebrew usage: for it is a groundless conjecture that the vine branch is called so&#772;re&#772;q from the dark-red grapes (Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>); and the incorrectness of it is evident from the fact, that even the Arabic s&#780;aqira does not denote dark-red, but bright, fiery red. The Arabic translator has therefore rendered the Greek &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; by Arab. as&#780;qaru in Sol 5:9; but &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; answers to the Hebrew &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;, and the lxx have expressed su&#772;s&#305;&#772;m 'a&#774;dumm&#305;&#772;m by &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>. If we compare this with ch. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-2.htm">Zechariah 6:2</a>, where the chariots are drawn by red ('a&#774;dumm&#305;&#772;m, &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;), black (shecho&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), white (lebha&#770;n&#305;&#772;m, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;), and speckled (berudd&#305;&#772;m, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;) horses, and with <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, where the first rider has a white horse (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), the second a red one (&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), the third a black one (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;), the fourth a pale horse (&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), there can be no further doubt that three of the colours of the horses mentioned here occur again in the two passages quoted, and that the black horse is simply added as a fourth; so that the seruqq&#305;&#772;m correspond to the berudd&#305;&#772;m of <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-3.htm">Zechariah 6:3</a>, and the &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>, and consequently sa&#770;ro&#772;q denotes that starling kind of grey in which the black ground is mixed with white, so that it is not essentially different from ba&#770;ro&#772;d, speckled, or black covered with white spots (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-12.htm">Genesis 31:12</a>).<p>By comparing these passages with one another, we obtain so much as certain with regard to the meaning of the different colours, - namely, that the colours neither denote the lands and nations to which the riders had been sent, as Hvernick, Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, and others suppose; nor the three imperial kingdoms, as Jerome, Cyril, and others have attempted to prove. For, apart from the fact that there is no foundation whatever for the combination proposed, of the red colour with the south as the place of light, or of the white with the west, the fourth quarter of the heavens would be altogether wanting. Moreover, the riders mentioned here have unquestionably gone through the earth in company, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, or at any rate there is no intimation whatever of their having gone through the different countries separately, according to the colour of their respective horses; and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-6.htm">Zechariah 6:6</a>, not only the chariot with the black horses, but that with the white horses also, goes into the land of the south. Consequently the colour of the horses can only be connected with the mission which the riders had to perform. This is confirmed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, inasmuch as a great sword is there given to the rider upon the red horse, to take away peace from the earth, that they may kill one another, and a crown to the rider upon the white horse, who goes forth conquering and to conquer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>), whilst the one upon the pale horse receives the name of Death, and has power given to him to slay the fourth part of the earth with sword, famine, and pestilence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). It is true that no such effects as these are attributed to the riders in the vision before us, but this constitutes no essential difference. To the prophet's question, ma&#770;h-'e&#772;lleh, what are these? i.e., what do they mean? the angelus interpres, whom he addresses as "my lord" ('a&#774;do&#772;n&#305;&#772;), answers, "I will show thee what these be;" whereupon the man upon the red horse, as the leader of the company, gives this reply: "These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to go through the earth;" and then proceeds to give the angel of the Lord the report of their mission, viz., "We have been through the earth, and behold all the earth sitteth still and at rest." The man's answer (vayya&#8219;an, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>) is not addressed to the prophet or to the angelus interpres, but to the angel of the Lord mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, to whom the former, with his horsemen (hence the plural, "they answered," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>), had given a report of the result of their mission. The verb &#8219;a&#770;na&#770;h, to answer, refers not to any definite question, but to the request for an explanation contained in the conversation between the prophet and the interpreting angel. &#1495;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, is not the land of Judah, or any other land, but the earth. The answer, that the whole earth sits still and at rest (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1514; denotes the peaceful and secure condition of a land and its inhabitants, undisturbed by any foe; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-40.htm">1 Chronicles 4:40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>), points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7-8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-22.htm">Haggai 2:22-23</a>. God had there announced that for a little He would shake heaven and earth, the whole world and all nations, that the nations would come and fill His temple with glory. The riders sent out by God now return and report that the earth is by no means shaken and in motion, but the whole world sits quiet and at rest. We must not, indeed, infer from this account that the riders were all sent for the simple and exclusive purpose of obtaining information concerning the state of the earth, and communicating it to the Lord. For it would have been quite superfluous and unmeaning to send out an entire troop, on horses of different colours, for this purpose alone. Their mission was rather to take an active part in the agitation of the nations, if any such existed, and guide it to the divinely appointed end, and that in the manner indicated by the colour of their horses; viz., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, those upon the red horses by war and bloodshed; those upon the starling-grey, or speckled horses, by famine, pestilence, and other plagues; and lastly, those upon the white horses, by victory and the conquest of the world.<p>In the second year of Darius there prevailed universal peace; all the nations of the earlier Chaldaean empire were at rest, and lived in undisturbed prosperity. Only Judaea, the home of the nation of God, was still for the most part lying waste, and Jerusalem was still without walls, and exposed in the most defenceless manner to all the insults of the opponents of the Jews. Such a state of things as this necessarily tended to produce great conflicts in the minds of the more godly men, and to confirm the frivolous in their indifference towards the Lord. As long as the nations of the world enjoyed undisturbed peace, Judah could not expect any essential improvement in its condition. Even though Darius had granted permission for the building of the temple to be continued, the people were still under the bondage of the power of the world, without any prospect of the realization of the glory predicted by the earlier prophets (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>), which was to dawn upon the nation of God when redeemed from Babylon. Hence the angel of the Lord addresses the intercessory prayer to Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a> : How long wilt Thou not have compassion upon Jerusalem, etc.? For the very fact that the angel of the Lord, through whom Jehovah had formerly led His people and brought them into the promised land and smitten all the enemies before Israel, now appears again, contains in itself one source of consolation. His coming was a sign that Jehovah had not forsaken His people, and His intercession could not fail to remove every doubt as to the fulfilment of the divine promises. The circumstance that the angel of Jehovah addresses an intercessory prayer to Jehovah on behalf of Judah, is no more a disproof of his essential unity with Jehovah, than the intercessory prayer of Christ in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/17.htm">John 17</a> is a disproof of His divinity. The words, "over which Thou hast now been angry for seventy years," do not imply that the seventy years of the Babylonian captivity predicted by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) were only just drawing to a close. They had already expired in the first year of the reign of Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>). At the same time, the remark made by Vitringa, Hengstenberg, and others, must not be overlooked, - namely, that these seventy years were completed twice, inasmuch as there were also (not perhaps quite, but nearly) seventy years between the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple, and the second year of Darius. Now, since the temple was still lying in ruins in the second year of Darius, notwithstanding the command to rebuild it that had been issued by Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>), it might very well appear as though the troubles of the captivity would never come to an end. Under such circumstances, the longing for an end to be put to the mournful condition of Judah could not fail to become greater and greater; and the prayer, "Put an end, O Lord, put an end to all our distress," more importunate than ever.<p>Jehovah replied to the intercession of the angel of the Lord with good and comforting words. Debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m to&#772;bh&#305;&#772;m are words which promise good, i.e., salvation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). So far as they set before the people the prospect of the mitigation of their distress, they are nichumm&#305;&#772;m, consolations. The word nichumm&#305;&#772;m is a substantive, and in apposition to debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m. Instead of the form nichumm&#305;&#772;m, the keri has the form nichum&#305;&#772;m, which is grammatically the more correct of the two, and which is written still more accurately nichu&#772;m&#305;&#772;m in some of the codd. in Kennicott. The contents of these words, which are addressed to the interpreting angel either directly or through the medium of the angel of Jehovah, follow in the announcement which the latter orders the prophet to make in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-17</a>. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>) as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>. The word of the Lord contains two things: (1) the assurance of energetic love on the part of God towards Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>); and (2) the promise that this love will show itself in the restoration and prosperity of Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>). &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;, to be jealous, applied to the jealousy of love as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>, etc., is strengthened by &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492; &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;. Observe, too, the use of the perfect &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, as distinguished from the participle &#1511;&#1510;&#1507;. The perfect is not merely used in the sense of "I have become jealous," expressing the fact that Jehovah was inspired with burning jealousy, to take Jerusalem to Himself (Koehler), but includes the thought that God has already manifested this zeal, or begun to put it in action, namely by liberating His people from exile. Zion, namely the mountain of Zion, is mentioned along with Jerusalem as being the site on which the temple stood, so that Jerusalem only comes into consideration as the capital of the kingdom. Jehovah is also angry with the self-secure and peaceful nations. The participle qo&#772;tse&#772;ph designates the wrath as lasting. Sha'a&#774;na&#770;n, quiet and careless in their confidence in their own power and prosperity, which they regard as secured for ever. The following word, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, quod, introduces the reason why God is angry, viz., because, whereas He was only a little angry with Israel, they assisted for evil. &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; refers to the duration, not to the greatness of the anger (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>). &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, they helped, so that evil was the result (&#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>), i.e., they assisted not only as the instruments of God for the chastisement of Judah, but so that harm arose from it, inasmuch as they endeavoured to destroy Israel altogether (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>). It is no ground of objection to this definition of the meaning of the words, that &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; in that case does not form an appropriate antithesis to &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, which relates to time (Koehler); for the fact that the anger only lasted a short time, was in itself a proof that God did not intend to destroy His people. To understand &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; as only referring to the prolonged oppression and captivity, does not sufficiently answer to the words. Therefore (la&#770;khe&#772;n, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>), because Jehovah is jealous with love for His people, and very angry with the heathen, He has now turned with compassion towards Jerusalem. The perfect &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not purely prophetic, but describes the event as having already commenced, and as still continuing. This compassion will show itself in the fact that the house of God is to be built in Jerusalem, and the city itself restored, and all the obstacles to this are to be cleared out of the way. The measuring line is drawn over a city, to mark off the space it is to occupy, and the plan upon which it is to be arranged. The chethib &#1511;&#1493;&#1492; bihtehc , probably to be read &#1511;&#1493;&#1492;, is the obsolete form, which occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a>, and was displaced by the contracted form &#1511;&#1493; (keri). But the compassion of God will not be restricted to this. The prophet is to proclaim still more ("cry yet," <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>, referring to the "cry" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>). The cities of Jehovah, i.e., of the land of the Lord, are still to overflow with good, or with prosperity. Pu&#772;ts, to overflow, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-16.htm">Proverbs 5:16</a>; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 196, c). The last two clauses round off the promise. When the Lord shall restore the temple and city, then will Zion and Jerusalem learn that He is comforting her, and has chosen her still. The last thought is repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-13</a> :16 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>.<p>In this vision it is shown to the prophet, and through him to the people, that although the immediate condition of things presents no prospect of the fulfilment of the promised restoration and glorification of Israel, the Lord has nevertheless already appointed the instruments of His judgment, and sent them out to overthrow the nations of the world, that are still living at rest and in security, and to perfect His Zion. The fulfilment of this consolatory promise is neither to be transferred to the end of the present course of this world, as is supposed by Hofmann (Weiss. u. Erfll. i. 335), who refers to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-18.htm">Zechariah 14:18-19</a> in support of this, nor to be restricted to what was done in the immediate future for the rebuilding of the temple and of the city of Jerusalem. The promise embraces the whole of the future of the kingdom of God; so that whilst the commencement of the fulfilment is to be seen in the fact that the building of the temple was finished in the sixth year of Darius, and Jerusalem itself was also restored by Nehemiah in the reign of Artaxerxes, these commencements of the fulfilment sim</body></html>
