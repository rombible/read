But though the prophet speaks of this after he has foretold their restoration, it does not follow that it shall take place after that event. It is certainly much more probable that they will first be brought to repentance for the sin of rejecting and crucifying their Messiah, and to believe in him <span class="ital">with their heart unto righteousness, </span>and then that God will bestow upon them that great mercy of re-establishing them in the possession of Canaan: see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-2.htm" title="Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.">Zechariah 12:2</a>. “The Jews had stumbled and fallen at the stone of stumbling and rock of offence, the Messiah, in his humble appearance, as Isaiah foretold. That no one might be surprised at this sudden change of their affairs, [namely, their restoration to their own land, and their prosperity therein,] Zechariah tells us, they should themselves be first changed, and repent heartily of that sin which had been the cause of their fall, for God should <span class="ital">pour out on them the spirit of grace and supplication, </span>that they might <span class="ital">look </span>with compunction of heart <span class="ital">on him whom they had pierced; </span>and he should, by his Spirit, improve those good dispositions into a thorough conviction of his being the Messiah, whom they had rejected: for this they should weep bitterly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm" title="In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.">Zechariah 12:11</a>, and make earnest supplications till received again into his grace and favour. This done, it follows, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>, <span class="ital">In that day shall a fountain be opened, </span>&c. Now who were they whose sin and uncleanness were washed away, but the house of David, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the same who had sinned, and mourned, and repented, and were therefore pardoned? What did they mourn for, but for <span class="ital">him whom they had pierced, </span>and whose death they had bewailed with all the solemnities of true mourners? It was then the act and sin of the house of David, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that they pierced and slew him whom they now looked upon; for which their land was treated as polluted, and removed out of God’s sight into captivity, not to be restored to them till their sin was remitted upon their true repentance. Thus much is evident from the context:” see Chandler’s <span class="ital">Defence, </span>and Dodd.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But though this passage may chiefly relate to the future and general conversion of the Jews to the Christian faith, Which St. Paul calls <span class="ital">life from the dead, </span>and therefore will not receive its full accomplishment till that event takes place; yet it may also be understood of some other prior conversions of the Jewish people, and particularly of those of the many thousands brought to repentance by the preaching of John the Baptist, of Christ, and his apostles. For it appears from the accounts we have in the New Testament, that though the rulers and leading men among the Jews were not converted in that age of the Christian Church, yet a vast number of the people were. So that this prophecy has, in some degree at least, been already fulfilled, and the <span class="ital">spirit of grace and supplication </span>hath been poured out in a measure, if not upon <span class="ital">the house of David, </span>yet upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem. In the expression, <span class="ital">They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, </span>(the words being spoken by God,) is implied, that in the piercing of Christ, God himself, figuratively speaking, was pierced through the wounds of his beloved Son, he being infinitely dear to his heavenly Father, and his cause the cause of God. This passage is undoubtedly cited in St. John’s gospel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" title="And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.">John 19:37</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οψονται εις ον εξεκεντησαν</span>, <span class="ital">They shall look on him whom they have pierced. </span>For although the present Hebrew text is, <span class="greekheb">הבישׂו אלי</span>, <span class="ital">They shall look unto me, </span>between forty and fifty MSS. are produced which read <span class="greekheb">אלוו</span>, <span class="ital">unto him, </span>with the concurrence of other authorities. <span class="ital">They shall mourn for him — </span>They shall heartily lament the crucifying of the Lord Jesus, not only as the sinful, cruel act of their fathers, but as that in which their sins had a great share. <span class="ital">As one mourneth for his only son — </span>With an unfeigned and real, a great and long-continued, a deep and lasting sorrow, such as is the sorrow of a father on the death of an only son: they shall retain it inwardly, and express it outwardly, as in the funeral mournings on such occasions. <span class="ital">And shall be in bitterness for him —</span> True repentance will bitterly lament the sins that brought sorrows and pain upon the Son of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:9-14 The day here spoken of, is the day of Jerusalem's defence and deliverance, that glorious day when God will appear for the salvation of his people. In Christ's first coming he bruised the serpent's head, and broke all the powers of darkness that fought against God's kingdom among men. In his second coming he will complete their destruction, when he shall put down all opposing rule, principality, and power; and death itself shall be swallowed up in that victory. The Holy Spirit is gracious and merciful, and is the Author of all grace or holiness. He, also, is the Spirit of supplications, and shows men their ignorance, want, guilt, misery, and danger. At the time here foretold, the Jews will know who the crucified Jesus was; then they shall look by faith to him, and mourn with the deepest sorrow, not only in public, but in private, even each one separately. There is a holy mourning, the effect of the pouring out of the Spirit; a mourning for sin, which quickens faith in Christ, and qualifies for joy in God. This mourning is a fruit of the Spirit of grace, a proof of a work of grace in the soul, and of the Spirit of supplications. It is fulfilled in all who sorrow for sin after a godly sort; they look to Christ crucified, and mourn for him. Looking by faith upon the cross of Christ will cause us to mourn for sin after a godly sort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will pour - As He promised by Joel, "I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>. See vol. i. pp. 193, 194), largely, abundantly, "upon the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem," all, highest and lowest, from first to last, the "Spirit of grace and supplication," that is, the "Holy Spirit" which conveyeth "grace," as "the Spirit of wisdom and understanding" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a> is "the Spirit" infusing "wisdom and understanding," and the "Spirit of counsel and might" is that same Spirit, imparting the gift "of counsel" to see what is to be done and "of might" to do it, and the Spirit "of the knowledge and of the fear of the Lord" is that same "Spirit," infusing loving acquaintance with God, with awe at His infinite Majesty. So "the Spirit of grace and supplication," is that same Spirit, infusing grace and bringing into a state of favor with God, and a "Spirit of supplication" is that Spirit, calling out of the inmost soul the cry for a yet larger measure of the grace already given. Paul speaks of "the love of God poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>; and of "insulting the Spirit of grace" , rudely repulsing the Spirit, who giveth grace. Osorius: "When God Himself says, 'I will pour out,' He sets forth the greatness of His bountifulness whereby He bestoweth all things."<p>And they shall look - with trustful hope and longing. Cyril: "When they had nailed the Divine Shrine to the Wood, they who had crucified Him, stood around, impiously mocking. But when He had laid down His life for us, "the centurion and they that were with him, watching Jesus, seeing the earthquake and those things which were done, feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a>. As it ever is with sin, compunction did not come till the sin was over: till then, it was overlaid; else the sin could not be done. At the first conversion, the three thousand "were pricked 'in the heart.' "when told that He "whom they had taken and with wicked hands had crucified and slain, is Lord and Christ" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>. This awoke the first penitence of him who became Paul. "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" This has been the center of Christian devotion ever since, the security against passion, the impulse to self-denial, the parent of zeal for souls, the incentive to love; this has struck the rock, that it gushed forth in tears of penitence: this is the strength and vigor of hatred of sin, to look to Him whom our sins pierced, "who" Paul says, "loved me and gave Himself for me." Osorius: "We all lifted Him up upon the Cross; we transfixed with the nails His hands and feet; we pierced His Side with the spear. For if man had not sinned, the Son of God would have endured no torment."<p>And they shall mourn for Him, as one mourneth for an only son, and shall be in bitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for a first-born - We feel most sensibly the sorrows of this life, passing as they are; and of these, the loss of an only son is a proverbial sorrow. "O daughter of My people, gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes," God says; "make thee the mourning of an only son, Most bitter lamentation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>. "I will make it as the mourning of an only son" <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>. The dead man carried out, "the only son of his mother and she was a widow," is recorded as having touched the heart of Jesus. Alb.: "And our Lord, to the letter, was the Only-Begotten of His Father and His mother." He was "the first-begotten of every creature" <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, and "we saw His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. This mourning for Him whom our sins pierced and nailed to the tree, is continued, week by week, by the pious, on the day of the week, when He suffered for us, or in the perpetual memorial of His Precious Death in the Holy Eucharist, and especially in Passion-Tide. God sends forth anew "the Spirit of grace and supplication," and the faithful mourn, because of their share in His Death. The prophecy had a rich and copious fulfillment in that first conversion in the first Pentecost; a larger fulfillment awaits it in the end, when, after the destruction of antichrist, "all Israel shall" be converted and "be saved." <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>.<p>There is yet a more awful fulfillment; when "He cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see Him, and they which pierced Him, and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>. But meanwhile it is fulfilled in every solid conversion of Jew pagan or careless Christian, as well as in the devotion of the pious. Zechariah has concentrated in few words the tenderest devotion of the Gospel, "They shall look on Me whom they pierced." Lap.: "Zechariah teaches that among the various feelings which we can elicit from the meditation on the Passion of Christ, as admiration, love, gratitude, compunction, fear, penitence, imitation, patience, joy, hope, the feeling of compassion stands eminent, and that it is this, which we especially owe to Christ suffering for us. For who would not in his inmost self grieve with Christ, innocent and holy, yea the Only Begotten Son of God, when he sees Him nailed to the Cross and enduring so lovingly for him sufferings so manifold and so great? Who would not groan out commiseration, and melt into tears? Truly says Bonaventure in his 'goad of divine love:' 'What can be more fruitful, what sweeter than, with the whole heart, to suffer with that most bitter suffering of our Lord Jesus Christ? '" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Future conversion of the Jews is to flow from an extraordinary outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Jer 31:9, 31-34; Eze 39:29).<p>spirit of grace &#8230; supplications&#8212;"spirit" is here not the spirit produced, but THE Holy Spirit producing a "gracious" disposition, and inclination for "supplications." Calvin explains "spirit of grace" as the grace of God itself (whereby He "pours" out His bowels of mercy), "conjoined with the sense of it in man's heart." The "spirit of supplications" is the mercury whose rise or fall is an unerring test of the state of the Church [Moore]. In Hebrew, "grace" and "supplications" are kindred terms; translate, therefore, "gracious supplications." The plural implies suppliant prayers "without ceasing." Herein not merely external help against the foe, as before, but internal grace is promised subsequently.<p>look upon me&#8212;with profoundly earnest regard, as the Messiah whom they so long denied.<p>pierced&#8212;implying Messiah's humanity: as "I will pour &#8230; spirit" implies His divinity.<p>look &#8230; mourn&#8212;True repentance arises from the sight by faith of the crucified Saviour. It is the tear that drops from the eye of faith looking on Him. Terror only produces remorse. The true penitent weeps over his sins in love to Him who in love has suffered for them.<p>me &#8230; him&#8212;The change of person is due to Jehovah-Messiah speaking in His own person first, then the prophet speaking of Him. The Jews, to avoid the conclusion that He whom they have "pierced" is Jehovah-Messiah, who says, "I will pour out &#8230; spirit," altered "me" into "him," and represent the "pierced" one to be Messiah Ben (son of) Joseph, who was to suffer in the battle with Cog, before Messiah Ben David should come to reign. But Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic oppose this; and the ancient Jews interpreted it of Messiah. Ps 22:16 also refers to His being "pierced." So Joh 19:37; Re 1:7. The actual piercing of His side was the culminating point of all their insulting treatment of Him. The act of the Roman soldier who pierced Him was their act (Mt 27:25), and is so accounted here in Zechariah. The Hebrew word is always used of a literal piercing (so Zec 13:3); not of a metaphorical piercing, "insulted," as Maurer and other Rationalists (from the Septuagint) represent.<p>as one mourneth for &#8230; son&#8212;(Jer 6:26; Am 8:10). A proverbial phrase peculiarly forcible among the Jews, who felt childlessness as a curse and dishonor. Applied with peculiar propriety to mourning for Messiah, "the first-born among many brethren" (Ro 8:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And I; </span> God the Father, so <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>,18 Isa 44:3</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Will pour, </span> in plentiful measures, as a plentiful rain is poured forth on a thirsty ground: this was fulfilled on Christ’s exaltation, when he received gifts for men, and, being glorified, gave the Spirit, sent the Comforter to his disciples and believers; this is daily performed to the children of God, and will be continually performed till we all are made perfect, and are brought to be with Christ for ever. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon the house of David; </span> on some of that royal family; or, typically considered, it is the whole family of Christ, his house, who was the seed of David, and who is called David their king, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm" title="Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.">Hosea 3:5</a></span>.

The Jews that belong to the family of Christ, and to the heavenly Jerusalem, the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven: <p>the Spirit of grace and of supplications; by which is meant the Holy Spirit of God, who is called the "Spirit of grace"; not merely because he is good and gracious, and loving to his people, and is of grace given unto them; but because he is the author of all grace in them; of gracious convictions, and spiritual illuminations; of quickening, regenerating, converting, and sanctifying grace; and of all particular graces, as faith, hope, love, fear, repentance, humility, joy, peace, meekness, patience, longsuffering, self-denial, &amp;c.; as well as because he is the revealer, applier, and witnesser of all the blessings of grace unto them: and he is called the "Spirit of supplications"; because he indites the prayers of his people, shows them their wants, and stirs them up to pray; enlarges their hearts, supplies them with arguments, and puts words into their mouths; gives faith, fervency, and freedom, and encourages to come to God as their Father, and makes intercession for them, according to the will of God: pouring it upon them denotes the abundance and freeness of his grace; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, <p>and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; by nailing him to the tree at his crucifixion; and especially by piercing his side with a spear; which, though not personally done by them, yet by their ancestors, at least through their instigation and request; and besides, as he was pierced and wounded for their sins, so by them: and now, being enlightened and convicted by the Spirit of God, they shall look to him by faith for the pardon of their sins, through his blood; for the justification of their persons by his righteousness; and for eternal life and salvation through him. We Christians can have no doubt upon us that this passage belongs to Christ, when it is observed, upon one of the soldiers piercing the side of Jesus with a spear, it is said, "these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled; they shall look on him whom they have pierced"; and it seems also to be referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a> yea, the Jews themselves, some of them, acknowledge it is to be understood of the Messiah. In the Talmud (f), mention being made of the mourning after spoken of, it is asked, what this mourning was made for? and it is replied, R. Dusa and the Rabbins are divided about it: one says, for Messiah ben Joseph, who shall be slain; and another says, for the evil imagination, that shall be slain; it must be granted to him that says, for Messiah the son of Joseph that shall be slain; as it is written, "and they shall look upon whom they have pierced, and mourn", &amp;c. for, for the other, why should they mourn? hence Jarchi and Kimchi on the place say, our Rabbins interpret this of Messiah the son of Joseph, who shall be slain; and the note of Aben Ezra is, all the nations shall look unto me, to see what I will do to those who have pierced Messiah the son of Joseph. Grotius observes, that Hadarsan on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10</a> understands it of Messiah the son of David. The Jews observing some prophecies speaking of the Messiah in a state of humiliation, and others of him in an exalted state, have coined this notion of two Messiahs, which are easily reconciled without it. The Messiah here prophesied of appears to be both God and man; a divine Person called Jehovah, who is all along speaking in the context, and in the text itself; for none else could pour out the spirit of grace and supplication; and yet he must be man, to be pierced; and the same is spoken of, that would do the one, and suffer the other; and therefore must be the  or God-man in one person. As to what a Jewish writer (g) objects, that this was spoken of one that was pierced in war, as appears from the context; and that if the same person that is pierced is to be looked to, then it would have been said, "and mourn for me, and be in bitterness for me"; it may be replied, that this prophecy does not speak of the piercing this person at the time when the above wars shall be; but of the Jews mourning for him at the time of their conversion, who had been pierced by them, that is, by their ancestors, hundreds of years ago; which now they will with contrition remember, they having assented to it, and commended it as a right action; and as for the change from the first person to the third, this is not at all unusual in Scripture: <p>and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son; or, "for this" (h); that is, piercing him; for sin committed against him; because of their rejection of him, their hardness of heart, and unbelief with respect to him; and on account of their many sins, which were the occasion of his being pierced; which mourning will arise from, and be increased by, a spiritual sight of him, a sense of his love to them, and a view of benefits by him. Evangelical repentance springs from faith, and is accompanied with it; and this godly sorrow is like that which is expressed for an only son; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a> and indeed Christ is the only begotten of the Father, as well as the firstborn among many brethren, as follows: <p>and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn; sin is a bitter thing, and makes work for bitter repentance. <p>(f) T.

We may say generally that the clause intimates that the people, who had grieved and offended God by their sins and ingratitude, should repent and turn to him in faith. But there was a literal fulfilment of this piercing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> slaying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-3.htm">Zechariah 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>), when the Jews crucified the Messiah, him who was God and Man, and of whom, as a result of the hypostatic union, the properties of one nature are often predicated of the other. Thus St. Paul says that the Jews crucified "the Lord of glory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>), and bids the Ephesian elders "feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; for the reading <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, see the critics). St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a>) refers to these words of Zechariah as a prophecy of the Crucifixion (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>). The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, "They shall look to me because they insulted," either reading the last verb differently, or understanding it figuratively in the sense of assailing with cutting words; but there is no doubt about the true reading and interpretation. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Aspicient ad me quem confixerunt.</span> "Me" has been altered in some manuscripts into "him:" but this is an evident gloss received into the text for controversial purposes, or to obviate the supposed impropriety of representing Jehovah as slain by the impious. That St. John seems to sanction this reading is of no critical importance, as he is merely referring to the prophecy historically, and does not profess to give the very wording of the prophet. A suffering Messiah was not an unknown idea in Zechariah's time. He has already spoken of the Shepherd as despised and ill-treated, and a little further on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>) he intimates that he is stricken with the sword. The prophecies of Isaiah had familiarized him with the same notion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, etc.). And when he represents Jehovah as saying, "Me whom they pierced," it is not merely that in killing his messenger and representative they may be said to have killed him, but the prophet, by inspiration, acknowledges the two natures in the one Person of Messiah, even as Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>) called him the "Mighty God," and the psalmists often speak to the same effect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). The "looking to" the stricken Messiah began when they who saw that woeful sight smote their breasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-48.htm">Luke 23:48</a>); it was carried on by the preaching of the apostles; it shall continue till all Israel is converted; it is re-enacted whenever penitent sinners turn to him whom they have crucified by their sins. Critics have supposed that the person whose murder is deplored is Isaiah, or Urijah, or Jeremiah; but none of these fulfill the prediction in the text. <span class="cmt_word">They shall mourn for him.</span> There is a change of persons here. Jehovah speaks of the Messiah as distinct in Person from himself. <span class="cmt_word">As one mourneth for his only son...  for his firstborn.</span> The depth and poignancy of this mourning are expressed by a double comparison, the grief felt at the loss of an only son, and of the firstborn. Among the Hebrews the preservation of the family was deemed of vast importance, and its extinction regarded as a punishment and a curse, so that the death of an only son would be the heaviest blow that could happen (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>). Peculiar privileges belonged to the firstborn, and his loss would be estimated accordingly (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). The mention of "piercing," just above, seems to connect the passage with the Passover solemnities  and the destruction of the firstborn of the Egyptians (see <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 6. p. 131, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zechariah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second vision is closely connected with the first, and shows how God will discharge the fierceness of His wrath upon the heathen nations in their self-security (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>. "And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a>. And I said to the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-20.htm">Zechariah 1:20</a>. And Jehovah showed me four smiths. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-21.htm">Zechariah 1:21</a>. And I said, What come these to do? And He spake to me thus: These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no one lifted up his head; these are now come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations which have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it." The mediating angel interprets the four horns to the prophet first of all as the horns which have scattered Judah; then literally, as the nations which have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it. The horn is a symbol of power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). The horns therefore symbolize the powers of the world, which rise up in hostility against Judah and hurt it. The number four does not point to the four quarters of the heaven, denoting the heathen foes of Israel in all the countries of the world (Hitzig, Maurer, Koehler, and others). This view cannot be established from <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10</a>, for there is no reference to any dispersion of Israel to the four winds there. Nor does it follow from the perfect &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; that only such nations are to be thought of, as had already risen up in hostility to Israel and Judah in the time of Zechariah; for it cannot be shown that there were four such nations. At that time all the nations round about Judah were subject to the Persian empire, as they had been in Nebuchadnezzar's time to the Babylonian. Both the number four and the perfect ze&#772;ru&#772; belong to the sphere of inward intuition, in which the objects are combined together so as to form one complete picture, without any regard to the time of their appearing in historical reality. Just as the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-15</a> sees the four chariots all together, although they follow one another in action, so may the four horns which are seen simultaneously represent nations which succeeded one another. This is shown still more clearly by the visions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> and 7, in which not only the colossal image seen in a dream by Nebuchadnezzar (ch. 2), but also the four beasts which are seen by Daniel to ascend simultaneously from the sea, symbolize the four empires, which rose up in succession one after the other. It is to these four empires that the four horns of our vision refer, as Jerome, Abarb., Hengstenberg, and others have correctly pointed out, since even the picturing of nations or empires as horns points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7-8</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3-9</a>. Zechariah sees these in all the full development of their power, in which they have oppressed and crushed the people of God (hence the perfect ze&#772;ru&#772;), and for which they are to be destroyed themselves. Za&#770;ra&#770;h, to scatter, denotes the dissolution of the united condition and independence of the nation of God. In this sense all four empires destroyed Judah, although the Persian and Grecian empires did not carry Judah out of their own land.<p>The striking combination, "Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem," in which not only the introduction of the name of Israel between Judah and Jerusalem is to be noticed, but also the fact that the nota acc. &#1488;&#1514; is only placed before Yehu&#772;da&#770;h and Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l, and not before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim also, is not explained on the ground that Israel denotes the kingdom of the ten tribes, Judah the southern kingdom, and Jerusalem the capital of the kingdom (Maurer, Umbreit, and others), for in that case Israel would necessarily have been repeated before Judah, and 'e&#772;th before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim. Still less can the name Israel denote the rural population of Judah (Hitzig), or the name Judah the princely house (Neumann). By the fact that 'e&#772;th is omitted before Yeru&#772;sha&#770;laim, and only Vav stands before it, Jerusalem is connected with Israel and separated from Judah; and by the repetition of 'e&#772;th before Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l, as well as before Yehu&#772;da&#770;h, Israel with Jerusalem is co-ordinated with Judah. Kliefoth infers from this that "the heathen had dispersed on the one hand Judah, and on the other hand Israel together with Jerusalem," and understands this as signifying that in the nation of God itself a separation is presupposed, like the previous separation into Judah and the kingdom of the ten tribes. "When the Messiah comes," he says, "a small portion of the Israel according to the flesh will receive Him, and so constitute the genuine people of God and the true Israel, the Judah; whereas the greater part of the Israel according to the flesh will reject the Messiah at first, and harden itself in unbelief, until at the end of time it will also be converted, and join the true Judah of Christendom." But this explanation, according to which Judah would denote the believing portion of the nation of twelve tribes, and Israel and Jerusalem the unbelieving, is wrecked on the grammatical difficulty that the cop. &#1493; is wanting before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;. If the names Judah and Israel were intended to be co-ordinated with one another as two different portions of the covenant nation as a whole, the two parts would necessarily have been connected together by the cop. Vav. Moreover, in the two co-ordinated names Judah and Israel, the one could not possibly stand in the spiritual sense, and the other in the carnal. The co-ordination of 'eth-Yehu&#772;da&#770;h with 'eth-Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l without the cop. Vav shows that Israel is really equivalent to the Jerusalem which is subordinated to it, and does not contain a second member (or part), which is added to it, - in other words, that Israel with Jerusalem is merely an interpretation or more precise definition of Yehu&#772;da&#770;h; and Hengstenberg has hit upon the correct idea, when he takes Israel as the honourable name of Judah, or, more correctly, as an honourable name for the covenant nation as then existing in Judah. This explanation is not rendered questionable by the objection offered by Koehler: viz., that after the separation of the two kingdoms, the expression Israel always denotes either the kingdom of the ten tribes, or the posterity of Jacob without regard to their being broken up, because this is not the fact. The use of the name Israel for Judah after the separation of the kingdoms is established beyond all question by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>, etc.<p>(Note: Gesenius has correctly observed in his Thesaurus, p. 1339, that "from this time (i.e., from the severance of the kingdom) the name of Israel began to be usurped by the whole nation that was then in existence, and was used chiefly by the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Deutero(?)-Isaiah, and after the captivity by Ezra and Nehemiah; from which it came to pass, that in the Paralipomena, even when allusion is made to an earlier period, Israel stands for Judah," although the proofs adduced in support of this from the passages quoted from the prophets need considerable sifting.)<p>Jehovah then showed the prophet four cha&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m, or workmen, i.e., smiths; and on his putting the question, "What have these come to do?" gave him this reply: "To terrify those," etc. For the order of the words &#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, instead of &#1502;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-12.htm">Genesis 42:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not a nominative written absolutely at the head of the sentence in the sense of "these horns," for that would require &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;; but the whole sentence is repeated from <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>, and to that the statement of the purpose for which the smiths have come is attached in the form of an apodosis: "these are the horns, etc., and they (the smiths) have come." At the same time, the earlier statement as to the horns is defined more minutely by the additional clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, according to the measure, i.e., in such a manner that no man lifted up his head any more, or so that Judah was utterly prostrate. Hacha&#774;r&#305;&#772;d, to throw into a state of alarm, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-2.htm">2 Samuel 17:2</a>. Them ('o&#772;tha&#770;m): this refers ad sensum to the nations symbolized by the horns. Yaddo&#772;th, inf. piel of ya&#770;da&#770;h, to cast down, may be explained as referring to the power of the nations symbolized by the horns. 'Erets Yehu&#772;da&#770;h (the land of Judah) stands for the inhabitants of the land. The four smiths, therefore, symbolize the instruments "of the divine omnipotence by which the imperial power in its several historical forms is overthrown" (Kliefoth), or, as Theod. Mops. expresses it, "the powers that serve God and inflict vengeance upon them from many directions." The vision does not show what powers God will use for this purpose. It is simply designed to show to the people of God, that every hostile power of the world which has risen up against it, or shall rise up, is to be judged and destroyed by the Lord. </body></html>
