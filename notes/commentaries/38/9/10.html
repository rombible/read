To the same purpose speaks the Prophet <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-7.htm" title="But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.">Hosea 1:7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/5-10.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD, that I will cut off your horses out of the middle of you, and I will destroy your chariots:...">Micah 5:10-11</a> : passages which mutually support and cast light on each other, and show undeniably what the prophet had in view when he foretold that the Messiah should ride on an ass. This verse is also intended to signify that the kingdom of the Messiah should be a kingdom of peace, by which characteristic it is frequently described in the prophetic writings. Not that wars were immediately to cease on the earth at his coming, but because his doctrine, example, and grace, naturally tend to produce and promote universal peace and harmony; to diffuse among men a spirit of benevolence and humility, of meekness and forbearance; of <span class="ital">doing to others, </span>in every case, <span class="ital">as we would they should do unto us </span>in the like case. So that, if Christ’s religion were truly and universally received and practised, certain it is there would be a universal peace among men, and we should no longer see or hear of wars and slaughters. And undoubtedly, before the consummation of all things, his religion will diffuse peace over all the earth. Another thing intended in this prediction is, that Christ’s kingdom should not be set up, nor advanced, by external force and violence, by carnal weapons, or an arm of flesh; but by the power of truth and grace. For it follows, <span class="ital">He shall speak peace unto the heathen, </span>or, <span class="ital">unto the nations, </span>as the Hebrew is, namely, to the Gentile nations that were afar off, as well as to the Jews that were nigh; his gospel being the <span class="ital">gospel of peace, </span>proclaiming and ensuring peace to all the truly penitent that believe in him <span class="ital">with their heart unto righteousness; </span>even peace with God, peace of conscience, tranquillity of mind, and a disposition, as far as possible, to live peaceably with all men. <span class="ital">And his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river, </span>&c. — As was foretold by David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm" title="He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.">Psalm 72:8</a>, from whence these words are taken: see the note there. The sense is, his kingdom shall extend itself to all parts of the world, in defiance of the opposition made to it. The preachers of his gospel shall carry it from one country to another; from one island and continent to another; till the remotest parts of the earth are enlightened, and reduced by it to the obedience of the faith, and the practice of love and holiness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:9-17 The prophet breaks forth into a joyful representation of the coming of the Messiah, of whom the ancient Jews explained this prophecy. He took the character of their King, when he entered Jerusalem amidst the hosannas of the multitude. But his kingdom is a spiritual kingdom. It shall not be advanced by outward force or carnal weapons. His gospel shall be preached to the world, and be received among the heathen. A sinful state is a state of bondage; it is a pit, or dungeon, in which there is no water, no comfort; and we are all by nature prisoners in this pit. Through the precious blood of Christ, many prisoners of Satan have been set at liberty from the horrible pit in which they must otherwise have perished, without hope or comfort. While we admire Him, let us seek that his holiness and truth may be shown in our own spirits and conduct. These promises have accomplishment in the spiritual blessings of the gospel which we enjoy by Jesus Christ. As the deliverance of the Jews was typical of redemption by Christ, so this invitation speaks to all the language of the gospel call. Sinners are prisoners, but prisoners of hope; their case is sad, but not desperate; for there is hope in Israel concerning them. Christ is a Strong-hold, a strong Tower, in whom believers are safe from the fear of the wrath of God, the curse of the law, and the assaults of spiritual enemies. To him we must turn with lively faith; to him we must flee, and trust in his name under all trials and sufferings. It is here promised that the Lord would deliver his people. This passage also refers to the apostles, and the preachers of the gospel in the early ages. God was evidently with them; his words from their lips pierced the hearts and consciences of the hearers. They were wondrously defended in persecution, and were filled with the influences of the Holy Spirit. They were saved by the Good Shepherd as his flock, and honoured as jewels of his crown. The gifts, graces, and consolations of the Spirit, poured forth on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2 and in succeeding times, are represented. Sharp have been, and still will be, the conflicts of Zion's sons, but their God will give them success. The more we are employed, and satisfied with his goodness, the more we shall admire the beauty revealed in the Redeemer. Whatever gifts God bestows on us, we must serve him cheerfully with them; and, when refreshed with blessings, we must say, How great is his goodness!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will cut off the chariot - The horse is the symbol of worldly power, as the ass is of meekness. "Some," says the Psalmist, "put their trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>. "A horse is but a vain thing to save a man" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-17.htm">Psalm 33:17</a>. "He delighteth not in the strength of a horse" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>). In scarcely any place in Holy Scripture is the horse spoken of in relation to man, except as the instrument of war. It represents human might, which is either to be consecrated to the Lord, or destroyed by Him (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>). As the "stone, cut out without hands" <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>, broke in pieces and absorbed into itself all the kingdoms of the world, so here He, whose Kingdom should not be of this world, should supersede human might. His kingdom was to begin by doing away, among His followers, all, whereby human kingdoms are established. He first cuts off the chariot and the horse, not from His enemies, but from His own people; His people, not as a civil polity, but as the people of God. For the prophet speaks of them as Ephraim and Judah, but Ephraim had no longer a distinct existence.<p>And He shall speak peace unto the pagan - As the Apostle says, "He came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>. He shall speak it to them, as He who hath power to give it to them, peace with God, peace in themselves, the reconciliation of God and man, and the remission of their sins.<p>Osorius: "At His birth the heavenly host announced peace to men; all His doctrine has peace for its end; when His death was at hand, He especially commended peace to His disciples, that peace which the world knoweth not, which is contained in tranquility of mind, burning zeal for charity. Divine grace. This same peace He brought to all who gathered themselves to His empire and guidance, that, emerging from intestine wars and foul darkness, they might behold the light of liberty, and, in all wisdom keep the grace of God."<p>And His dominion shall be from sea to sea - The bounds of the promised land, in its utmost range, on the west, were the Mediterranean sea; on the east, "the great river," the Euphrates. The prophet pictures its extension, so as to embrace the whole world, taking away, first the one bound, then the other. "From sea to sea" is from the Mediterranean to the most extreme east, Where the Ocean encircles the continent of Asia; "from the river to the ends of the earth," is from the Euphrates to the most extreme west, embracing the whole of Europe; and whatever may lie beyond, to the ends of the earth, where earth ceaseth to be . It is this same lowly and afflicted king, whose entry into Jerusalem is on a despised animal, who shall, by His mere will, make war to cease, who shall, by His mere word, give peace to the pagan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The Targum paraphrases it, <p>"I will break the strength of those that make war, the armies of the people;'' <p>all this does not design so much the outward peace that should be in the world at the birth of Christ, as the spiritual peace of his kingdom; and that, as it is not of this world, so neither is it spread, supported, and defended by carnal weapons; and also the peaceableness and safety of his subjects, and the destruction of their enemies: <p>and he shall speak peace unto the heathen; not only the church of Christ, gathered out of the Jews, should enjoy great spiritual peace, prosperity, and safety; but the Gentiles also should share in it, to whom Christ went, and preached peace; not in his own person, being the minister of the circumcision: but by his apostles, who had the ministration of reconciliation committed to them; and being sent forth by Christ, went everywhere preaching peace by him, who is Lord of all, unto all nations; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>, <p>and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth; according to Aben Ezra, from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the river Euphrates to the ends of the earth: or, as Kimchi cites him, from the south sea, called the sea of Edom, to the north sea, which is the sea of the ocean; from the river that goes out from Eden, which is at the beginning of the east, unto the ends of the earth, which is the end of the west: or, as the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"from the sea to the west, and from Euphrates to the ends of the earth.'' <p>The phrases are expressive of the extensiveness of Christ's dominion, through the preaching of the Gospel, both in Judea and in the Gentile world, before the destruction of Jerusalem; and especially in the latter day; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>.

It is true that the name is not so used in “acknowledged post-captivity writings,” but it does not follow that because a writer so uses it, he is not a post-captivity writer. In chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.">Zechariah 8:13</a> of this Book, which is confessedly written after the captivity, the “house of Judah” and the “house of Israel” are distinguished. And in a prophecy during the captivity, and why not therefore in one after it? the ten tribes are distinguished from the two by this very name of Ephraim. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/37-15.htm" title="The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,...">Ezekiel 37:15-28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from sea even to sea</span>, &c.] Identical with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm" title="He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.">Psalm 72:8</a>, where Dean Perowne quotes Pusey (<span class="ital">Daniel</span>, p. 480), “From the Mediterranean, their Western boundary, to the encircling sea beyond Asia’s utmost verge; and from their Eastern boundary, <span class="ital">the river</span>, the Euphrates, <span class="ital">unto the ends of the earth</span>,” and adds, “But perhaps we have only a poetical expression, not to be construed into the prose of geography, or to be explained (as by Rashi and others) as indicating the extent of territory laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm" title="And I will set your bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and you shall drive them out before you.">Exodus 23:31</a>.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will cut off the chariot.</span> All the apparatus of war will be removed, Messiah's rule being not established by physical force, or maintained by military defences.

From the use of these terms here it cannot be concluded that the author wrote at a time when the two kingdoms existed side by side. In the first place, the description of the whole people is given poetically, and must not be taken to have more significance than is intended; and secondly, in ch. 8:13, which is confessedly post-exilian, the "house of Judah," and the "house of Israel" are distinguished. Dr. Cheyne notes, too, that in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:15-28), who prophesied during the Captivity, the ten tribes are distinguished by the name of  Ephraim, and pertinently asks why such term may not be also used by one who wrote after the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">The battle bow stands for all weapons of war.</span> That Messiah's kingdom should be peaceful and peace-bringing, see the prophecies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall speak peace unto the heathen.</span> He will extend this peace to all the world, teaching the heathen to receive his spiritual rule, to compose their differences, to lay aside their arms, and live as one united family (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From sea even to sea.</span> Geographically, the phrase means from the Dead Sea on the east to the Mediterranean on the west, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>, from whence our passage is derived.

And now be comforted, Zerubbabel, is the saying of Jehovah; and be comforted, Joshua son of Jozadak, thou high priest; and be comforted all the people of the land, is the saying of Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-5.htm">Haggai 2:5</a>. The word that I concluded with you at your coming out of Egypt, and my Spirit, stand in the midst of you; fear ye not." The prophet, admitting the poverty of the new building in comparison with the former one, exhorts them to continue the work in comfort, and promises them that the Lord will be with them, and fulfil His covenant promises. The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-3.htm">Haggai 2:3</a> is addressed to the old men, who had seen Solomon's temple in all its glory. There might be many such men still living, as it was only sixty-seven or sixty-eight years since the destruction of the first temple. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; is the predicate to the subject &#1502;&#1497;, and has the article because it is defined by the reflex action of the relative clause which follows (compare Ewald, 277, a). The second question, &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, et qualem videtis, In what condition do ye see it now? is appended to the last clause of the first question: the house which ye saw in its former glory. There then follows with &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, in the form of a lively assurance, the statement of the difference between the two buildings. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, which has been interpreted in very different ways, may be explained from the double use of the &#1499; in comparisons, which is common in Hebrew, and which answers to our as - so: here, however, it is used in the same way as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-18.htm">Genesis 44:18</a>; that is to say, the object to be compared is mentioned first, and the object with which the comparison is instituted is mentioned afterwards, in this sense, "so is it, as having no existence," in which case we should either leave out the first particle of comparison, or if it were expressed, should have to reverse the order of the words: "as not existing (nothing), so is it in your eyes." Koehler gives this correct explanation; whereas if &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; be explained according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>, its equal, or such an one, we get the unsuitable thought, that it is not the temple itself, but something like the temple, that is compared to nothing. Even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-18.htm">Genesis 44:18</a>, to which Ewald very properly refers as containing a perfectly equivalent phrase, it is not a man equal to Joseph, but Joseph himself, who is compared to Pharaoh, and described as being equal to him. Nevertheless they are not to let their courage fail, but to be comforted and to work. Cha&#770;zaq, to be inwardly strong, i.e., to be comforted, 'Ash, to work or procure, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm">Ruth 2:19</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13</a>, in actual fact, to continue the work of building bravely, without there being any necessity to supply &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; from <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>. For Jehovah will be with them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>).<p>In confirmation of this promise the Lord adds, that the word which He concluded with them on their coming out of Egypt, and His Spirit, will continue among them. "The word" ('eth-hadda&#770;bha&#770;r) cannot be either the accusative of the object to the preceding verb &#8219;a&#774;su&#772; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-4.htm">Haggai 2:4</a>), or to any verb we may choose to supply, or the preposition 'e&#772;th, with, or the accusative of norm or measure (Luther, Calvin, and others). To connect it with &#8219;a&#774;su&#772; yields no suitable meaning. It is not the word, which they vowed to the Lord, at the conclusion of the covenant, that they are to do now, but the work which they had begun, viz., the building of the temple, they are now to continue. It is perfectly arbitrary to supply the verb zikhru&#772;, remember (Ewald and Hengstenberg), and to understand the prophet as reminding them of the word "fear not" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17-20</a>). That word, "fear not," with which Moses, not God, infused courage into the people, who were alarmed at the terrible phenomenon with which Jehovah came down upon Sinai, has no such central significance as that Haggai could point to it without further introduction, and say that Jehovah had concluded it with them on their coming out of Egypt. The word which the Lord concluded with Israel when He led it out of Egypt, can only be the promise which established the covenant, to the fulfilment of which God bound Himself in relation to the people, when He led them out of Egypt, namely, the word that He would make Israel into His own property out of all nations (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-22.htm">Jeremiah 7:22-23</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>). It would quite agree with this to take 'e&#772;th as the accusative of the norm, and also to connect it as a preposition, if this could only be shown to be in accordance with the rules of the language. But although the accusative in Hebrew is often used, in the relation of free subordination, "to express more precisely the relation of measure and size, space and time, mode and kind" (cf. Ewald, 204-206), it is impossible to find any example of such an accusative of norm as is here assumed, especially with 'e&#772;th preceding it. But if 'e&#772;th were a preposition instead of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, we should have &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, inasmuch as the use of &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, as a parallel to &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, makes the words clumsy and awkward. The thought which Haggai evidently wishes to express requires that hadda&#770;bha&#770;r should stand upon the same line with ru&#772;ch&#305;&#772;, so that 'eth-hadda&#770;bha&#770;r is actually the subject to &#8219;o&#772;medeth, and 'e&#772;th is simply used to connect the new declaration with the preceding one, and to place it in subjection to the one which follows, in the sense of "as regards," quoad (Ewald, 277, d, pp. 683-4), in which case the choice of the accusative in the present instance may either be explained from a kind of attraction (as in the Latin, urbem quam statuo vestra est), as Hitzig supposes, or from the blending together of two constructions, as Koehler maintains; that is to say, Haggai intended to write &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, but was induced to alter the proposed construction by the relative clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; attaching itself to &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;. Consequently &#8219;o&#772;medeth, as predicate, not only belongs to ru&#772;ch&#305;&#772;, but also to hadda&#770;bha&#770;r, in the sense of to have continuance and validity; and according to a later usage of the language, &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is used for &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, to stand fast (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-14.htm">Daniel 11:14</a>). The word, that Israel is the property of Jehovah, and Jehovah the God of Israel, still stands in undiminished force; and not only so, but His Spirit also still works in the midst of Israel. Ru&#772;a&#774;ch, in parallelism with the word containing the foundation of the covenant, is neither the spirit of prophecy (Chald., J. D. Mich.), nor the spirit which once filled Bezaleel and his companions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1</a>.), enabling them to erect the tabernacle in a proper manner, and one well-pleasing to God (Luc., Osiander, and Koehler). Both views are too narrow; ru&#772;a&#774;ch is the divine power which accompanies the word of promise and realizes it in a creative manner, i.e., not merely "the virtue with which God will establish their souls, that they may not be overcome by temptations" (Calvin), but also the power of the Spirit working in the world, which is able to remove all the external obstacles that present themselves to the realization of the divine plan of salvation. This Spirit is still working in Israel ("in the midst of you"); therefore they are not to fear, even if the existing state of things does not correspond to human expectations. The omnipotence of God can and will carry out His word, and glorify His temple. This leads to the further promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-9</a>, which gives the reason for the exhortation, "Fear ye not." </body></html>
