While the Macedonians and Alexander's successors were in warfare in these countries, the Lord promised to protect his people. God's house lies in the midst of an enemy's country; his church is as a lily among thorns. God's power and goodness are seen in her special preservation. The Lord encamps about his church, and while armies of proud opposers shall pass by and return, his eyes watch over her, so that they cannot prevail, and shortly the time will come when no exactor shall pass by her any more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will take away his blood from his mouth;<p>And his abominations from between his teeth;<p>And he too shall be left to our God,<p>And he shall be as a govenor in Judah;<p>And Ekron as a Jebusite.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Zechariah 9:5</a>Ashkelon shall see and fear - The words express that to see and fear shall be as one.

Sennacherib speaks of the kings of Ascalon, Ekron and Gaza .<p>A contemperary of Alexander  mentions, that the king of Gaza was brought alive to Alexander on its capture. Alexander's policy was essentially different from that of the world-monarchs before him. They desired only to hold an empire as wide as possible, leaving the native kings, if they could; and only, if these were intractable, placing their own lieutenants. Alexander's policy was to blend East and West into one. . These petty sovereignties, so many insulated centers of mutual repulsion, were essentially at variance with this plan, and so this remnant of sovereignty of 1,500 years was taken away by him, when, after a siege in which he himself was twice wounded, he took it.

It is probable, that Philip preached the Gospel here, seeing it was not far from Azotus or Ashdod, next mentioned, where Philip is heard of after the baptism of the eunuch: and if Ekron is the same with Caesarea, that was called Strato's tower, as say the Jews (k); and which also Jerom (l) observes, some say are the same it is certain that Philip was there, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a> there were several Christian bishops of this place in later times (m). <p>And the king shall perish from Gaza; some understand this of Batis, who was governor of Gaza, when it was taken by Alexander; who was fastened to a chariot, and dragged about the city, as Curtius (n) relates; but this man was not a king, but governor of the city under one: I rather think the idol Marnes, which signifies "the lord of man", and was worshipped in this place, is here meant; which when it became Christian was destroyed, and a Christian church built in the room of it, as is reported by Jerom (o). <p>And Ashkelon shall not be inhabited; by Heathens, but by Christians. <p>(h) Reland.

No argument can be drawn from this in favour of the ante-captivity date of this prophecy. It had been the policy of the Assyrians, Chaldæans and Persians to leave tributary kings in the countries which they subdued. Hence their own monarchs assumed the title of “king of kings” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm" title="Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.">Ezra 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-7.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring on Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.">Ezekiel 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-37.htm" title="You, O king, are a king of kings: for the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.">Daniel 2:37</a>), and as Herodotus states it was the custom of the Persians to put honour upon the sons of the kings whom they had deposed and promote them to the sovereignty of their fathers (iii. 15). Alexander on the contrary pursued an entirely different plan and aimed at a consolidated empire. Such tributary monarchies were therefore abolished by him. Hegesias, a writer contemporary with Alexander, states that the king of Gaza was brought alive to the conqueror after the capture of the city, which in spite of the fate of Tyre had held out for five months. There is considerable difficulty in reconciling the statements of different writers on this point, but there seems no reason to doubt that the ruler of Gaza bore the title of “king” at that time.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ashkelon shall see it.</span> The ruin of so mighty a city as Tyre naturally filled neighbouring people with dismay. The prophet directs his attention to Philistia, and threatens its chief cities. The cities are enumerated in the same order as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>. Gath is omitted, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>:. It seems never to have recovered its destruction by Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). (For Ashkelon, Gaza, and Ekron, see note on Amos 1:6.) <span class="cmt_word">Her expectation shall be ashamed.</span> The hope of aid from Tyre shall not be fulfilled. After the fall of Tyre, Alexander continued his march southwards towards Egypt, subduing the cities on his way. The siege of Gaze delayed him some months; and when it was taken, it shared the treatment of Tyre. Its governor, one Batis, a eunuch, was tied alive to the conqueror's chariot, and dragged round the walls, in cruel imitation of the fate of Hector. <span class="cmt_word">The king shall perish from Gaza.</span> No particular king is meant; but the prediction says that henceforward no king should reign in Gaze. In contrast with the Eastern policy of allowing conquered nations to retain their own rulers as tributary sovereigns, Alexander always deposed or slew reigning monarchs, and consolidated his empire by replacing them with governors of his own. The various chastisements are meted out by the prophet among the various cities, though they equally apply to all. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/haggai/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This penitential state of mind on the part of the people and their rulers was met by the Lord with the promise of His assistance, in order to elevate this disposition into determination and deed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>. "Then spake Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, in the message of Jehovah to the people, thus: I am with you, is the saying of Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>. And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, and the spirit of Joshua, and the spirit of all the remnant of the nation; and they came and did work at the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God." The prophet is called &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>, i.e., messenger (not "angel," as many in the time of the fathers misunderstood the word as meaning), as being sent by Jehovah to the people, to make known to them His will (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>, where the same epithet is applied to the priest). As the messenger of Jehovah, he speaks by command of Jehovah, and not in his own name or by his own impulse. &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, I am with you, will help you, and will remove all the obstacles that stand in the way of your building (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-4.htm">Haggai 2:4</a>). This promise Jehovah fulfilled, first of all by giving to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the people, a willingness to carry out the work. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, to awaken the spirit of any man, i.e., to make him willing and glad to carry out His resolutions (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>). Thus filled with joyfulness, courage, and strength, they began the work on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of king Darius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>), that is to say, twenty-three days after Haggai had first addressed his challenge to them. The interval had been spent in deliberation and counsel, and in preparations for carrying out the work. In several editions and some few mss in Kennicott, in Tischendorf's edition of the lxx, in the Itala and in the Vulgate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a> is joined to the next chapter. But this is proved to be incorrect by the fact that the chronological statements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-1.htm">Haggai 2:1</a> are irreconcilable with one another. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a> is really so closely connected with <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>, that it is rather to be regarded as the last clause of that verse. </body></html>
