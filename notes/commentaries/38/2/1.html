See Nehemiah 3., &c, &c. <span class="ital">And the angel that talked with me went forth — </span>Went away from me, as if he had performed his commission in regard to me, and was to commune with me no longer. <span class="ital">And another angel went out to meet him — </span>But, as he was going away, I saw another angel meet him. This appears to have been an angel sent with fresh commands, from the superior personage among the myrtle-trees, to the angel who communed with the prophet. <span class="ital">And said, Run, speak to this young man — </span>Hasten with all diligence, and communicate to the young and inexperienced prophet what will check his fears, and encourage him to proceed in the execution of his prophetic office. <span class="ital">Saying, Jerusalem — </span>Which hath so long lain in ruins, and seemed to be in a hopeless state, <span class="ital">shall be inhabited as towns, </span>&c. — Shall overflow with inhabitants, who shall occupy spaces beyond the circuit of the walls: that is, its inhabitants will multiply so fast, that the houses within the walls will not be able to contain them, and they will be obliged to seek habitations in the neighbouring country in villages, which shall be of as great extent <span class="ital">as towns, </span>which, although <span class="ital">without walls, </span>shall be safe and secure against the attacks of enemies; their own multitude of men being a sufficient defence to them. And their cattle will increase in proportion. That this was a fact with regard to Jerusalem, see Josephus, <span class="ital">De Bell. Jud., </span>lib. 5. chap. 4, where we learn that “the city, overflowing with its number of inhabitants, by degrees extended itself beyond its walls;” and that Herod Agrippa fortified the new part called Bezetha. <span class="ital">For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire — </span>Which cannot be scaled or undermined, as it would soon consume any that might attempt to do the one or the other. Thus, in regard to her inhabiting without walls, God engages to secure her as effectually as if she were surrounded with a wall of fire. “The image is most sublime, and expresses very strongly the protection of God. It must have reminded the Jews of the pillar of fire by which God directed and defended their ancestors.” — Newcome.

He alludes to the symbol of the divine presence in the holy of holies. Observe, reader, those that have Jehovah for their God have him for their glory: and they that have him in the midst of them have glory in the midst of them. And all those persons and places that have God in the midst of them, have him for a <span class="ital">wall of fire round about them; </span>for <span class="ital">upon all </span>that <span class="ital">glory, </span>there is, and <span class="ital">shall be, a defence, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm" title="And the LORD will create on every dwelling place of mount Zion, and on her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for on all the glory shall be a defense.">Isaiah 4:5</a>. This prophecy was fulfilled in part in that Jerusalem, which, in process of time, became a very flourishing city, and made a very great figure in those parts of the world, much beyond what could have been expected, considering how low it had been brought, and how long it was before it recovered itself. But it was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended far, like towns without walls, by the admission of the Gentiles into it; and which hath the Son of God, and God himself, for its prince and protector.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 The Son of David, even the Man Christ Jesus, whom the prophet sees with a measuring line in his hand, is the Master-Builder of his church. God notices the extent of his church, and will take care that whatever number of guests are brought to the wedding-supper, there shall be room. This vision means well to Jerusalem. The walls of a city, as they defend it, so they straiten its inhabitants; but Jerusalem shall be extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, yet shall be as safe as if it had the strongest walls. In the church of God there yet is room for other multitudes, more than man can number. None shall be refused who trust in Christ; and He never shuts out from heaven one true member of the church on earth. God will be a Wall of fire round them, which can neither be broken through nor undermined, nor can it be assailed without danger to those who attack. This vision was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended by admitting the Gentiles into it; and which has the Son of God for its Prince and Protector; especially in the glorious times yet to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man with a measuring line in his hand - Probably the Angel of the Lord, of whom Ezekiel has a like vision.

And saw a third vision; which, as Kimchi owns, refers to the times of the Messiah; though it might be of use to the Jews then present, to encourage them to expect the rebuilding of Jerusalem, in a literal sense: <p>and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand: by whom is meant, not Nehemiah, nor Zerubbabel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a> who were concerned in the building of Jerusalem; nor any mere man, nor even a created angel; for, though he may be the same with the other angel, that did not talk with the prophet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a> as Kimchi observes; seeing he seems to be superior to him that did; yet not a ministering spirit, but the Messiah, who in this book is often spoken of as a man; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> and by "the measuring line in his hand" may be meant eternal predestination, the Lamb's book of life, which is in his keeping; and is the measure and rule by which he proceeds in the calling, justification, and glorification of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven; or the Scriptures of truth, the measure and rule of doctrine, discipline, worship, and conversation; and according to which Christ forms, constitutes, and regulates Gospel churches; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/zechariah/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> man with a measuring line in his hand.</span><p>(a) This is the angel who was Christ: for in respect of his office he is often called an angel, but in respect of his eternal essence, is God, and so called.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/zechariah/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm" title="I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.">Zechariah 2:1</a>. <span class="ital">a man</span>] Probably an angel in human form, called a “young man,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm" title="And said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:">Zechariah 2:4</a>, where see note<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a measuring line</span>] The word is not the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, said the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth on Jerusalem.">Zechariah 1:16</a>; but the promise there is taken up here, and its literal fulfilment, which the action of the man with the line seemed about to secure, is merged in a greater blessing.

This third vision makes a further revelation of God's mercy to Israel. Consequent on the destruction of enemies shall be the growth and development of the chosen people till the time of their final glory (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>). There is some difficulty in arranging the details of this vision, depending in great measure on the decision we arrive at with regard to the  identification of the "young man" of ver. 4. Those who, as Theodoret, Hitzig, Schegg, Trcehon, Wright, Perowne, etc., consider him to be the man with the measuring line of ver. 1, do not explain why the message should be given to him instead of to the prophet who had asked for information. Nor is it at all certain that the measurer is meant to be regarded as having made a mistake in attempting to define the limits of what was practically unlimited - viz. the restored Jerusalem - and was stopped accordingly in his proceedings. It seems preferable, with Jerome, Cornelius a Lapide, Pusey, Keil, Knabenbauer, etc., to regard the "young man" as Zechariah himself. Then the vision is thus presented: The prophet sees a man with a measuring line; he asks whither he is going, and is answered that he was going forth to measure Jerusalem. Upon this the interpreting angel leaves the prophet's side to receive the explanation of the man's proceedings, and is met by a superior angel, who bids him hasten to tell the prophet the meaning of the vision. <span class="cmt_word">A man.</span> Probably an angel in human form, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A measuring line.</span> This is not the same word as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; but the idea there proposed is taken up here, and its fulfilment is set forth (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15, 16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/habakkuk/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1-3</a> form the introduction to the word of God, which the prophet receives in reply to his cry of lamentation addressed to the Lord in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12-17</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>. "I will stand upon my watchtower, and station myself upon the fortress, and will watch to see what He will say in me, and what I answer to my complaint. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>. Then Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that he may run who reads it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>. For the vision is yet fore the appointed end, and strives after the end, and does not lie: if it tarry, wait for it; for it will come, it does not fail." <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a> contains the prophet's conversation with himself. After he has poured out his trouble at the judgment announced, in a lamentation to the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12-17</a>), he encourages himself - after a pause, which we have to imagine after <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a> - to wait for the answer from God. He resolves to place himself upon his observatory, and look out for the revelation which the Lord will give to his questions. Mishmereth, a place of waiting or observing; ma&#770;tso&#772;r, a fortress, i.e., a watch-tower or spying-tower. Standing upon the watch, and stationing himself upon the fortification, are not to be understood as something external, as Hitzig supposes, implying that the prophet went up to a steep and lofty place, or to an actual tower, that he might be far away from the noise and bustle of men, and there turn his eyes towards heaven, and direct his collected mind towards God, to look out for a revelation. For nothing is known of any such custom as this, since the cases mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-21.htm">Exodus 33:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>, as extraordinary preparations for God to reveal Himself, are of a totally different kind from this; and the fact that Balaam the soothsayer went up to the top of a bare height, to look out for a revelation from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a>), furnishes not proof that the true prophets of Jehovah did the same, but is rather a heathenish feature, which shows that it was because Balaam did not rejoice in the possession of a firm prophetic word, that he looked out for revelations from God in significant phenomena of nature (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3-4</a>). The words of our verse are to be taken figuratively, or internally, like the appointment of the watchman in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>. The figure is taken from the custom of ascending high places for the purpose of looking into the distance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a>), and simply expresses the spiritual preparation of the prophet's soul for hearing the word of God within, i.e., the collecting of his mind by quietly entering into himself, and meditating upon the word and testimonies of God. Cyril and Calvin bring out the first idea. Thus the latter observes, that "the watch-tower is the recesses of the mind, where we withdraw ourselves from the world;" and then adds by way of explanation, "The prophet, under the name of the watch-tower, implies that he extricates himself as it were from the thoughts of the flesh, because there would be no end or measure, if he wished to judge according to his own perception;" whilst others find in it nothing more than firm continuance in reliance upon the word of God.<p>(Note: Theodoret very appropriately compares the words of Asaph in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-16.htm">Psalm 73:16</a>., "When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me, until I entered into the sanctuaries of God, and gave heed to their end;" and observes, "And there, says the prophet, will I remain as appointed, and not leave my post, but, standing upon such a rock as that upon which God placed great Moses, watch with a prophet's eyes for the solution of the things that Iseek.")<p>Tsippa&#770;h, to spy or watch, to wait for the answer from God. "This watching was lively and assiduous diligence on the part of the prophet, in carefully observing everything that took place in the spirit of his mind, and presented itself either to be seen or heard" (Burk). &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;, to speak in me, not merely to or with me; since the speaking of God to the prophets was an internal speaking, and not one that was perceptible from without. What I shall answer to my complaint (&#8219;al to&#772;khacht&#305;&#772;), namely, first of all to myself and then to the rest. To&#772;khachath, lit., correction, contradiction. Habakkuk refers to the complaint which he raised against God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13-17</a>, namely, that He let the wicked go on unpunished. He will wait for an answer from God to this complaint, to quiet his own heart, which is dissatisfied with the divine administration. Thus he draws a sharp distinction between his own speaking and the speaking of the Spirit of God within him. Jehovah gives the answer in what follows, first of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>) commanding him to write the vision (cha&#770;zo&#772;n, the revelation from God to be received by inward intuition) upon tables, so clearly, that men may be able to read it in running, i.e., quite easily.<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-8.htm">Deuteronomy 27:8</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>. The article attached to &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; does not point to the tables set up in the market-places for public notices to be written upon (Ewald), but simply means, make it clear on the tables on which thou shalt write it, referring to the noun implied in &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; (write), though not expressed (Delitzsch). &#1511;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1493; may be explained from &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-13.htm">Jeremiah 36:13</a>. The question is a disputed one, whether this command is to be understood literally or merely figuratively, "simply denoting the great importance of the prophecy, and the consequent necessity for it to be made accessible to the whole nation" (Hengstenberg, Dissertation, vol. i. p. 460). The passages quoted in support of the literal view, i.e., of the actual writing of the prophecy which follows upon tables, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>, are not decisive. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a> the prophet is commanded to write all the words of the Lord in a book (se&#772;pher); and so again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>, if &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is synonymous with &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a> there are only two significant words, which the prophet is to write upon a large table after having taken witnesses. It does not follow from either of these passages, that lucho&#772;th, tables, say wooden tables, had been already bound together into books among the Hebrews, so that we could be warranted in identifying the writing plainly upon tables with writing in a book. We therefore prefer the figurative view, just as in the case of the command issued to Daniel, to shut up his prophecy and seal it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>), inasmuch as the literal interpretation of the command, especially of the last words, would require that the table should be set up or hung out in some public place, and this cannot for a moment be thought of. The words simply express the thought, that the prophecy is to be laid to heart by all the people on account of its great importance, and that not merely in the present, but in the future also. This no doubt involved the obligation on the part of the prophet to take care, by committing it to writing, that it did not fall into oblivion. The reason for the writing is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>. The prophecy is &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, for the appointed time; i.e., it relates to the period fixed by God for its realization, which was then still (&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;) far off. &#1500; denotes direction towards a certain point either of place or time. The vision had a direction towards a point, which, when looked at from the present, was still in the future. This goal was the end (&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509; towards which it hastened, i.e., the "last time" (&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1511;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>; and &#1506;&#1514; &#1511;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>), the Messianic times, in which the judgment would fall upon the power of the world. &#1497;&#1508;&#1495; &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1509;, it pants for the end, inhiat fini, i.e., it strives to reach the end, to which it refers. "True prophecy is inspired, as it were, by an impulse to fulfil itself" (Hitzig). &#1497;&#1508;&#1495; is not an adjective, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>, but the third pers. imperf. hiphil of pu&#772;a&#774;ch; and the contracted form (&#1497;&#1508;&#1495; for &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495;), without a voluntative meaning, is the same as we frequently meet with in the loftier style of composition. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1499;&#1494;&#1468;&#1489;, "and does not deceive," i.e., will assuredly take place. If it (the vision) tarry, i.e., be not fulfilled immediately, wait for it, for it will surely take place (the inf. abs. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; to add force, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; applying to the fulfilment of the prophecy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-9.htm">Jeremiah 28:9</a>), will not fail; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, to remain behind, not to arrive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-5.htm">2 Samuel 20:5</a>).<p>(Note: The lxx have rendered &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1488; &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, which the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>) has still further defined by adding the article, and, connecting it with &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a> (lxx), has taken it as Messianic, and applied to the speedy coming of the Messiah to judgment; not, however, according to the exact meaning of the words, but according to the fundamental idea of the prophetic announcement. For the vision, the certain fulfilment of which is proclaimed by Habakkuk, predicts the judgment upon the power of the world, which the Messiah will bring to completion.) </body></html>
