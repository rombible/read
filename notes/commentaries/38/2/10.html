Many nations in that day would renounce idolatry, and God will own those for his people who join him with purpose of heart. Glorious times are foretold as a prophecy of our Lord's coming and kingdom. God is about to do something unexpected, and very surprising, and to plead his people's cause, which had long seemed neglected. Silently submit to his holy will, and patiently wait the event; assured that God will complete all his work. He will ere long come to judgment, to complete the salvation of his people, and to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion - It is a great jubilee of joy, to which Zion is invited. Thrice beside is she invited with this same word, and all for the restored or renewed Presence of God. "Cry aloud for joy, thou barren which bare not" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>, as here, on the coming in of the Gentiles, "Cry aloud for joy, O daughter of Zion; jubilate, O Israel; rejoice and exult with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem; the Lord, the King of Israel, is in the midst of thee" <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14-15</a>. "Shout and cry aloud for joy, O inhabitant of Zion; for great in the midst of thee is the Holy One of Israel" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/12-6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>. The source of joy is a fresh coming of God, a coming, whereby He should dwell abidingly among them: truly what is this, but the Incarnation? As John saith, "The Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; and, "Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them and shall be their God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.<p>Cyril: "Hence too you may learn how great a subject of contentment above is the Presence of the Saviour upon earth. He could not then but bid the spiritual Zion, "which is the Church of the Living God" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>, the most sacred multitude of those saved by faith, to cry aloud for joy and rejoice. But it was announced that He should come and be in the midst of her. For John saith to us, The Word "was in the world" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>, and, being God, was not severed from His creatures, but He was Himself the Source of life to all living, and holding all things together to well-being and life; but "the world knew Him not" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a> : for it worshiped the creature. But He came among us, when, taking our likeness, He was conceived by the holy Virgin, and "was seen upon earth and conversed with men" , and the divine David witnesseth saying, "Our God shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3</a>. Then also was there a haven for the Gentiles. For now no longer was the race of Israel alone taught, but the whole earth was engoldened with the evangelical preachings, and in every nation and country "great is His Name."<p>Jerome: "This too is to be understood of the Person of the Lord, that He exhorts His people, being restored from the captivity to their former abode, to be glad and rejoice, because the Lord Himself cometh and dwelleth in the midst of her, and many nations shall believe in Him, of whom it is said, "Ask of Me and I will give Thee nations for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>, and He shall dwell in the midst of them, as He saith to His disciples, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

"Woe to him who buildeth cities with blood, and foundeth castles with injustice. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>. For the earth will be filled with knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea." The earnest endeavour of the Chaldaean to found his dynasty in permanency through evil gain, manifested itself also in the building of cities with the blood and sweat of the subjugated nations. &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; and &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; are synonymous, and are used in the singular with indefinite generality, like &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>. The preposition &#1489;, attached to &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, denotes the means employed to attain the end, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>. This was murder, bloodshed, transportation, and tyranny of every kind. Ko&#772;ne&#772;n is not a participle with the Mem dropped, but a perfect; the address, which was opened with a participle, being continued in the finite tense (cf. Ewald, 350, a). With <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-13.htm">Habakkuk 2:13</a> the address takes a different turn from that which it has in the preceding woes. Whereas there the woe is always more fully expanded in the central verse by an exposition of the wrong, we have here a statement that it is of Jehovah, i.e., is ordered or inflicted by Him, that the nations weary themselves for the fire. The &#1493; before &#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; introduces the declaration of what it is that comes from Jehovah. &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (is it not? behold!) are connected together, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-26.htm">2 Chronicles 25:26</a>, to point to what follows as something great that was floating before the mind of the prophet. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, literally, for the need of the fire (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-13.htm">Nahum 2:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-16.htm">Isaiah 40:16</a>). They labour for the fire, i.e., that the fire may devour the cities that have been built with severe exertion, which exhausts the strength of the nations. So far they weary themselves for vanity, since the buildings are one day to fall into ruins, or be destroyed. Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-58.htm">Jeremiah 51:58</a>) has very suitably applied these words to the destruction of Babylon. This wearying of themselves for vanity is determined by Jehovah, for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>) the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah. That this may be the case, the kingdom of the world, which is hostile to the Lord and His glory, must be destroyed. This promise therefore involves a threat directed against the Chaldaean. His usurped glory shall be destroyed, that the glory of Jehovah of Sabaoth, i.e., of the God of the universe, may fill the whole earth. The thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a> is formed after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>, with trifling alterations, partly substantial, partly only formal. The choice of the niphal &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; instead of the &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; of Isaiah refers to the actual fact, and is induced in both passages by the different turn given to the thought. In Isaiah, for example, this thought closes the description of the glory and blessedness of the Messianic kingdom in its perfected state. The earth is then full of the knowledge of the Lord, and the peace throughout all nature which has already been promised is one fruit of that knowledge. In Habakkuk, on the other hand, this knowledge is only secured through the overthrow of the kingdom of the world, and consequently only thereby will the earth be filled with it, and that not with the knowledge of Jehovah (as in Isaiah), but with the knowledge of His glory (&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1497;), which is manifested in the judgment and overthrow of all ungodly powers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, compared with the primary passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1497; is "the &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; of Jehovah, which includes His right of majesty over the whole earth" (Delitzsch). &#1497;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1501; is altered in form, but not in sense, from the &#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of Isaiah; and &#1497;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is to be taken relatively, since &#1499; is only used as a preposition before a noun or participle, and not like a conjunction before a whole sentence (comp. Ewald, 360, a, with 337, c). &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1512; is an infinitive, not a noun, with the preposition &#1500;; for &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; is construed with the accus. rei, lit., the earth will be filled with the acknowledging. The water of the sea is a figure denoting overflowing abundance. </body></html>
