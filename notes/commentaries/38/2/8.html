The promises and privileges with which God's people are blessed, should engage us to join them, whatever it costs us. When Zion is enlarged to make room for all God's Israel, it is the greatest madness for any of them to stay in Babylon. The captivity of a sinful state is by no means to be continued in, though a man may be easy in worldly matters. Escape for thy life, look not behind thee. Christ has proclaimed that deliverance to the captives, which he has himself wrought out, and it concerns every one to resolve that sin shall not have dominion over him. Those who would be found among God's children, must save themselves from this world, see Ac 2:40. What Christ will do for his church, shall be an evident proof of God's care and affection. He that touches you, touches the apple of his eye. This is a strong expression of God's love to his church. He takes what is done against her as done against the tenderest part of the eye, to which the least touch is a great offence. Christ is sent to be the Protector of his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After the glory - Jonathan: "Which it is promised to bring upon you." This being the usual construction, the words involve a great course of God's dealing, of first showing favor to those who will receive favor, then abandoning or punishing the rest; as, when the eight souls had been received into the ark, the flood came; when Lot and his had escaped out of Sodom, the fire came down from heaven; when Israel had passed the Red Sea, Pharaoh's hosts were drowned; the election obtained what israel sought for, the rest were blinded. "The glory" then would be the glory, of which God says, "I will be the glory in the midst of you" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a>.<p>But further He who speaketh is Almighty God, "Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, He hath sent me; For lo I wave My hand against them - and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me; Lo I come and dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord, and many nations shall cleave unto the Lord in that day, and they shall be to Me a people and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know, that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you" <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8-10</a>. In all which series of promises, the I, of whom Israel were to know that the Lord of hosts had sent Him, is the I, who affirms of Himself what belongs to Almighty God only, inflicting punishment on the enemies of Judah, indwelling the Church and people, receiving the pagan as His own; and it is precisely by all these acts of power and love, that Israel shall know that the Lord of hosts had sent Him.<p>(Jerome: "In what follows, 'Thus saith the Lord of hosts, After glory, He hath sent Me' etc., the Saviour is introduced speaking, who, being Almighty God, saith that He was sent by the Father Almighty, not according to that whereby He was Almighty, but according to that, that, after glory, He was sent, "who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, and was made obedient unto the Father even unto death; and that, the death of the Cross" <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>. Nor is it marvel that Christ is called Almighty, in whose Person we read in the Apocalypse of John, "These things saith the faithful Witness - I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which was and which is and which is to come, the Almighty" <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, "to whom all power is given in heaven and in earth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; and who saith, "All things of the Father's are Mine" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-15.htm">John 16:15</a>. But if all things, that is, God from God, Lord from. Lord, Light from Light, therefore also Almighty from Almighty; for it cannot be, that diverse should be the glory of those whose Nature is One."<p>For he who toucheth - So as to injure , you, "toucheth the apple of His eye," that is, of Him who sent Him, Almighty God. So Jerome, Theodoret Others, as Cyril, of his own eye, turning to evil to himself; but the analogy of the other passages is against it), as in the song of Moses, "He led him about, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of His eye" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>; and David prays, "Keep me as the apple of the eye" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. O Zion &#8230; daughter of Babylon&#8212;Thou whose only sure dwelling is "Zion," inseparably connected with the temple, art altogether out of thy place in "dwelling with the daughter of Babylon" (that is, Babylon and her people, Ps 137:8; Isa 1:8).<p>After the glory&#8212;After restoring the "glory" (Zec 2:5; Isa 4:5; Ro 9:4) of Jehovah's presence to Jerusalem, He (God the Father) hath commissioned ME (God the Son, Isa 48:16, the Divine Angel: God thus being at once the Sender and the Sent) to visit in wrath "the nations which spoiled you." Messiah's twofold office from the Father is: (1) to glorify His Church; (2) to punish its foes (2Th 1:7-10). Both offices manifest His glory (Pr 16:4).<p>toucheth &#8230; the apple of his eye&#8212;namely, of Jehovah's eye (De 32:10; Ps 17:8; Pr 7:2). The pupil, or aperture, through which rays pass to the retina, is the tenderest part of the eye; the member which we most sedulously guard from hurt as being the dearest of our members; the one which feels most acutely the slightest injury, and the loss of which is irreparable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some refer this to what went before, as a reason why the Jews should return, for God hath commanded it. I think it is an encouragement to the Jews to return, because God had promised to make them a glory, and now assures them that he will take a very particular care of them, therefore sends his Son, as a Judge or Vindex against the nations that had spoiled the Jews; or God sends his Son to them to inform them that it is their interest to unite with the Jews, and become the people of God, and be partakers of the glory and safety of God’s Israel; however, to let them understand that it will be dangerous to do violence to Israel, as it would be dangerous to any one to violate what is most dear to him that can destroy the offender; to tell them Israel is the apple of God’s eye. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zechariah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thus saith the Lord of hosts,.... Christ, who is the true Jehovah, and Lord of armies, as appears from his being sent in the next clause: <p>After the glory; which is promised, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> so the Targum and Kimchi; or, "afterwards" shall be "the glory" (l); or a glorious time and state; that is, after God's people are brought out of mystical Babylon, when the Jews shall be converted, and the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in, then will be the latter day glory; and at the same time will be the fall and destruction of antichrist, and of the antichristian states, as follows: <p>hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you; the Chaldeans and Babylonians, who spoiled and carried captive the Jews; or the antichristian nations, which persecuted and wasted the people of God, the followers of the Lamb; but now Christ will be sent, and will come in a spiritual manner, and take vengeance on them; he will destroy antichrist with the breath of his mouth, and with the brightness of his coming; with the sharp sword going out of his mouth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, <p>for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye; either his own eye, he hurts himself; or the eye of the Lord of hosts; "of mine eye", as some read it (m), as the Vulgate Latin version; which shows how near and dear the Lord's people are to him. The pupil or apple of the eye is a little aperture or perforation in the middle of the tunic or coat of the eye, called the uvea and iris, about which the iris forms a ring; and through this little opening the rays of light pass to the crystalline humour, to be formed on the retina or net, at the bottom of the eye. It is a very weak and tender part, and easily hurt with the least thing; and fitly describes the feeble state of Christ's people; and how soon and easily they may be disturbed, distressed, and hurt by their enemies: and as this is a principal part of the eye, and a part of a man's self, dear and valuable to him; so are the Lord's people parts, as it were, of himself; they are members of his body, closely united to him; and whatever injury is done to them he reckons as done to himself: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a> and being highly esteemed by him, and having the strongest affection for them, he resents every affront given them, and will punish all that hurt them; and exceeding careful is he of them, to keep and preserve them from being hurt: "he kept him as the apple of his eye", <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>, which, being such an useful and tender part as it is, it is wonderfully provided for by nature against all events; besides the orbit in which it is placed; and the eyebrows, which prevent many nuisances; and the eyelids, which cover and defend it in sleep; and the fringes of hair on them, which break the too violent impressions of light, and keep off motes and flies; there are no less, than six tunics or coats about it (n), as so many preservatives of it: now, as the God of nature has taken so much care of this useful member of the human body, how much more careful and tender must we suppose the God of grace, and our merciful Redeemer and High Priest, to be over his dear people, parts of himself, redeemed by his blood, and designed and prepared for eternal glory and happiness; and how daring must such be who offer the least violence unto them; nor must they expect to escape his wrath and vengeance, that seek their hurt, and give them disturbance; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a> and as this may respect the Jews called out of Babylon in the two preceding verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a>, it may be concluded that they were obedient to the divine call, though it is not recorded; it being not likely that God, who had so great a regard for them, would suffer them to continue there to their destruction; for it was about two years after this prophecy, in the fourth year of Darius, or the beginning of the fifth, that Babylon revolted from him, and was besieged twenty months by him, before he took it; and which he did at last by the stratagem of Zopyrus, one of his generals, when he beat down its walls and gates, and put to death three thousand of the inhabitants that were most guilty (o); but, before this, it is reasonable to suppose that the people of God, so dear unto him as is expressed, were called out from hence; as those of his people, equally dear to him, will be called out of mystical Babylon before its destruction; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>. <p>(l)  "tandem erit gloria, aut postea erit gloria", De Dieu.

The word rendered "apple" is usually considered in mean "aperture," or "gate," the pupil being the entrance to the visual organ; but Dr. Wright regards it rather as a natural word of endearment, like the Latin, <span class="accented">pupa, pupilla</span>, indicating "a doll," "little maiden of the eye."

"Woe to him who getteth a godless gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to save himself from the hand of calamity. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>. Thou hast consulted shame to thy house, destruction of many nations, and involvest thy soul in guilt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>. For the stone out of the wall will cry, and the spar out of the wood will answer it." To the Chaldaean's thirst for robbery and plunder there is attached quite simply the base avarice through which he seeks to procure strength and durability for his house. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, to get gain, has in itself the subordinate idea of unrighteous gain or sinful covetousness, since &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; denotes cutting or breaking something off from another's property, though here it is still further strengthened by the predicate &#1512;&#1506;, evil (gain). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; (his house) is not the palace, but the royal house of the Chaldaean, his dynasty, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a> clearly shows, where &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; evidently denotes the king's family, including the king himself. How far he makes &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; for his family, is more precisely defined by &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;, his (the Chaldaean's) nest, is neither his capital nor his palace or royal castle; but the setting up of his nest on high is a figure denoting the founding of his government, and securing it against attacks. As the eagle builds its nest on high, to protect it from harm (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a>), so does the Chaldaean seek to elevate and strengthen his rule by robbery and plunder, that it may never be wrested from his family again. We might here think of the buildings erected by Nebuchadnezzar for the fortification of Babylon, and also of the building of the royal palace (see Berosus in Hos. c. Ap. i. 19). We must not limit the figurative expression to this, however, but must rather refer it to all that the Chaldaean did to establish his rule. This is called the setting on high of his nest, to characterize it as an emanation from his pride, and the lofty thoughts of his heart. For the figure of the nest, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>. His intention in doing this is to save himself from the hand of adversity. &#1512;&#1506; is not masculine, the evil man; but neuter, adversity, or "the hostile fate, which, so far as its ultimate cause is God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>), is inevitable and irreversible" (Delitzsch). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a> the result of his heaping up of evil gain is announced: he has consulted shame to his house. &#1497;&#1506;&#1509;, to form a resolution. His determination to establish his house, and make it firm and lofty by evil gain, will bring shame to his house, and instead of honour and lasting glory, only shame and ruin. &#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, which has been variously rendered, cannot be the plural of the noun &#1511;&#1510;&#1492;, "the ends of many nations," since it is impossible to attach any intelligent meaning to this. It is rather the infinitive of the verb &#1511;&#1510;&#1492;, the occurrence of which Hitzig can only dispute by an arbitrary alteration of the text in four different passages, and is equivalent to &#1511;&#1510;&#1509;, to cut off, hew off, which occurs in the piel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>, but in the kal only here. The infinitive construct does not stand for the inf. abs., or for &#1500;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, exscindendo, but is used substantively, and is governed by &#1497;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;, which still retains its force from the previous clause. Thou hast consulted (resolved upon) the cutting off, or destruction, of many nations. &#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1496;&#1488;, and sinnest against thy soul thereby, i.e., bringest retribution upon thyself, throwest away thine own life. On the use of the participle in the sense of the second person without &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>. &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;, with the accusative of the person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-36.htm">Proverbs 8:36</a>, instead of &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; &#1489;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;. The participle is used, because the reference is to a present, which will only be completed in the future (Hitzig and Delitzsch). The reason for this verdict, and also for the ho&#772;i which stands at the head of this strophe, follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>. The stone out of the wall and the spar out of the woodwork will cry, sc. because of the wickedness which thou hast practised in connected with thy buildings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a>), or for vengeance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>), because they have been stolen, or obtained from stolen property. The apparently proverbial expression of the crying of stones is applied in a different way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>. &#1511;&#1497;&#1512; does not mean the wall of a room here, but, as distinguished from &#1506;&#1509;, the outside wall, and &#1506;&#1509;, the woodwork or beams of the buildings. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1505;, lit., that which binds, from &#1499;&#1508;&#1505; in the Syriac and Targum, to bind, is, according to Jerome, "the beam which is placed in the middle of any building to hold the walls together, and is generally called &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; by the Greeks." The explanations given by Suidas is, &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, hence rafters or beams. &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, will answer, sc. the stone, i.e., join in its crying (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>). </body></html>
