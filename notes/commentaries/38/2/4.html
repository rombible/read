So his visions, of which there is a whole series, are very largely concerned with the building of the Temple and of the city. In this one, he sees a man with a measuring-rod in his hand coming forth to take the dimensions of the still un-existing city of God. The words that I have read are the centre portion of that vision. You notice that there are three clauses, and that the first in order is the consequence of the other two. ‘Jerusalem shall be builded as a city without walls . . . for I will be a wall of fire round about her, and the glory in the midst of her.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And that exuberant promise was spoken about the Jerusalem over which Christ wept when he foresaw its inevitable destruction. When the Romans had cast a torch into the Temple, and the streets of the city were running with blood, what had become of Zechariah’s dream of a wall of fire round about her? Then can the divine fire be quenched? Yes. And who quenched it? Not the Romans, but the people that lived within that flaming rampart. The apparent failure of the promise carries the lesson for churches and individuals to-day, that in spite of such glowing predictions, there may again sound the voice that the legend says was heard within the Temple, on the night before Jerusalem fell. ‘Let us depart,’ and there was a rustling of unseen wings, and on the morrow the legionaries were in the shrine. ‘If God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now let us look, in the simplest possible way, at these three clauses, and the promises that are in them; keeping in mind that, like all the divine promises, they are conditional.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first is this:-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. ‘I will be a wall of fire round about her.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>I need not dwell on the vividness and beauty of that metaphor. These encircling flames will consume all antagonism, and defy all approach. But let me remind you that the conditional promise was intended for Judæ¡ and Jerusalem, and was fulfilled in literal fact. So long as the city obeyed and trusted God it was impregnable, though all the nations stood round about it, like dogs round a sheep. The fulfilment of the promise has passed over, with all the rest that characterised Israel’s position, to the Christian Church, and to-day, in the midst of all the agitations of opinion, and all the vauntings of men about an effete Christianity, and dead churches, it is as true as ever it was that the living Church of God is eternal. If it had not been that there was a God as a wall of fire round about the Church, it would have been wiped off the face of the earth long ago. If nothing else had killed it the faults of its members would have done so. The continuance of the Church is a perpetual miracle, when you take into account the weakness, and the errors, and the follies, and the stupidities, and the narrownesses, and the sins, of the people who in any given day represent it. That it should stand at all, and that it should conquer, seems to me to be as plain a demonstration of the present working of God, as is the existence still, as a separate individuality amongst the peoples of the earth, of His ancient people, the Jews. Who was it who said, when somebody asked him for the best proof of the truth of Christianity, ‘The Jews’? and so we may say, if you want a demonstration that God is working in the world, ‘Look at the continuance of the Christian Church.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In spite of all the vauntings of people that have already discounted its fall, and are talking as if it needed no more to be reckoned with, that calm confidence is the spirit in which we are to look around and forward. It does not become any Christian ever to have the smallest scintillation of a fear that the ship that bears Jesus Christ can fail to come to land, or can sink in the midst of the waters. There was once a timid would-be helper who put out his hand to hold up the Ark of God. He need not have been afraid. The oxen might stumble, and the cart roll about, but the Ark was safe and stable. A great deal may go, but the wall of fire will be around the Church. In regard to its existence, as in regard to the immortal being of each of its members, the great word remains for ever true: ‘Because I live ye shall live also.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But do not let us forget that this great promise does not belong only to the Church as a whole, but that we have each to bring it down to our own individual lives, and to be quite sure of this, that in spite of all that sense says, in spite of all that quivering hearts and weeping eyes may seem to prove, there is a wall of fire round each of us, if we are keeping near Jesus Christ, through which it is as impossible that any real evil should pass and get at us, as it would be impossible that any living thing should pass through the flaming battlements that the Prophet saw round his ideal city. Only we have to interpret that promise by faith and not by sense, and we have to make it possible that it shall be fulfilled by keeping inside the wall, and trusting to it. As faith dwindles, the fiery wall burns dim, and evil can get across its embers, and can get at us. Keep within the battlements, and they will flame up bright and impassable, with a fire that on the outer side consumes, but to those within is a fire that cherishes and warms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The next point of the promise passes into a more intimate region.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is well to have a defence from that which is without us; but it is more needful to have, if a comparison can be made between the two, a glory ‘in the midst’ of us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The one is external defence; the other inward illumination, with all which light symbolises-knowledge, joy, purity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is even more than that meant by this great promise. For notice that emphatic little word <span class="ital">the-the</span> glory, not <span class="ital">a</span> glory-in the midst of her. Now you all know what ‘the glory’ was. It was that symbolic Light that spoke of the special presence of God, and went with the Children of Israel in their wanderings, and sat between the Cherubim. There was no ‘Shechinah,’ as it is technically called, in that second Temple. But yet the Prophet says, ‘The glory’-the actual presence of God-’shall be in the midst of her,’ and the meaning of that great promise is taught us by the very last vision in the New Testament, in which the Seer of the Apocalypse says, ‘The glory of the Lord did lighten it’ {evidently quoting Zechariah}, ‘and the Lamb is the light thereof.’ So the city is lit as by one central glow of radiance that flashes its beams into every corner, and therefore ‘there shall be no night there.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now this promise, too, bears on churches and on individuals. On the Church as a whole it bears in this way: the only means by which a Christian community can fulfil its function, and be the light of the world, is by having the presence of God, in no metaphor, the actual presence of the illuminating Spirit in its midst. If it has not that, it may have anything and everything else-wealth, culture, learning, eloquence, influence in the world-but all is of no use; it will be darkness. We are light only in proportion as we are ‘light in the Lord.’ As long as we, as communities, keep our hearts in touch with Him, so long do we shine. Break the contact, and the light fades and flickers out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The same thing is true, dear brethren, about individuals. For each of us the secret of joy, of purity, of knowledge, is that we be holding close communion with God. If we have Him in the depths of our hearts, then, and only then, shall we be ‘light in the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And now look at the last point which follows, as I have said, as the result of the other two.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. ‘Jerusalem shall be without walls.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is to be like the defenceless villages scattered up and down over Israel. There is no need for bulwarks of stone. The wall of fire is round about. The Prophet has a vision of a great city, of a type unknown in those old times, though familiar to us in our more peaceful days, where there was no hindrance to expansion by encircling ramparts, no crowding together of the people because they needed to hide behind the city walls; and where the growing community could spread out into the outer suburbs, and have fresh air and ample space. That is the vision of the manner of city that Jerusalem was to be. It did not come true, but the ideal was this. It has not yet come true sufficiently in regard to the churches of to-day, but it ought to be the goal to which they are tending. The more a Christian community is independent of external material supports and defences the better.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I am not going to talk about the policy or impolicy of Established Churches, as they are called. But it seems to me that the principle that is enshrined in this vision is their condemnation. Never mind about stone and lime walls, trust in God and you will not need them, and you will be strong and ‘established’ just in the proportion in which you are cut loose from all dependence upon, and consequent subordination to, the civil power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But there is another thought that I might suggest, though I do not know that it is directly in the line of the Prophet’s vision; and that is-a Christian Church should neither depend on, nor be cribbed and cramped by, men-made defences of any kind. Luther tells us somewhere, in his parabolic way, of people that wept because there were no visible pillars to hold up the heavens, and were afraid that the sky would fall upon their heads. No, no, there is no fear of that happening, for an unseen hand holds them up. A church that hides behind the fortifications of its grandfathers’ erection has no room for expansion; and if it has no room for expansion it will not long continue as large as it is. It must either grow greater, or grow, and deserve to grow, less.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The same thing is true, dear brethren, about ourselves individually. Zechariah’s prophecy was never meant to prevent what he himself helped to further, the building of the actual walls of the actual city. And our dependence upon God is not to be so construed as that we are to waive our own common-sense and our own effort. That is not faith; it is fanaticism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have to build ourselves round, in this world, with other things than the ‘wall of fire,’ but in all our building we have to say, ‘Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchers watch in vain.’ But yet neither Jerusalem nor the Church, nor the earthly state of that believer who lives most fully the life of faith, exhausts this promise. It waits for the day when the city shall descend, ‘like a bride adorned for her husband, having no need of the sun nor of the moon, for the glory . . . lightens it.’ Having walls, indeed, but for splendour, not for defence; and having gates, which have only one of the functions of a gate-to stand wide open, to the east and the west, and the north and the south, for the nations to enter in; and never needing to be barred against enemies by day, ‘for there shall be no night there.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 The Son of David, even the Man Christ Jesus, whom the prophet sees with a measuring line in his hand, is the Master-Builder of his church. God notices the extent of his church, and will take care that whatever number of guests are brought to the wedding-supper, there shall be room. This vision means well to Jerusalem. The walls of a city, as they defend it, so they straiten its inhabitants; but Jerusalem shall be extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, yet shall be as safe as if it had the strongest walls. In the church of God there yet is room for other multitudes, more than man can number. None shall be refused who trust in Christ; and He never shuts out from heaven one true member of the church on earth. God will be a Wall of fire round them, which can neither be broken through nor undermined, nor can it be assailed without danger to those who attack. This vision was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended by admitting the Gentiles into it; and which has the Son of God for its Prince and Protector; especially in the glorious times yet to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And said unto him, Run, speak unto this young man - The prophet himself, who was to report to his people what he heard. Jeremiah says, "I am a youth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; and, "the young man," "the young prophet," carried the prophetic message from Elisha to Jehu. "Youth,'" common as our English term in regard to man, is inapplicable and unapplied to angels, who have not our human variations of age, but exist, as they were created.<p>Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls - Or as villages (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>), namely, an unconfined, uncramped population, spreading itself freely, without restraint of walls, and (it follows) without need of them. Clearly then it is no earthly city. To be inhabited as villages would be weakness, not strength; a peril, not a blessing. The earthly Jerusalem, so long as she remained unwalled, was in continual fear and weakness. God put it into the heart of His servant to desire to restore her; her wall was built, and then she prospered. He Himself had promised to Daniel, that "Her street shall be rebuilt, and her wall, even in strait of times" <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>. Nehemiah mourned 73 years after this, 443 b.c., when it was told him, "The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire" <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>. He said to Artaxerxes, "Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulehres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-3.htm">Nehemiah 2:3</a>. When permitted by Artaxerxes to return, he addressed the rulers of the Jews, "Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire; come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach; and they said, let us rise and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work" <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17-18</a>. When "the wall was finished and our enemies heard, and the pagan about us saw it, they were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God" <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15-16</a>.<p>This prophecy then looks on directly to the time of Christ. Wonderfully does it picture the gradual expansion of the kingdom of Christ, without bound or limit, whose protection and glory God is, and the character of its defenses. It should "dwell as villages," peacefully and gently expanding itself to the right and the left, through its own inherent power of multiplying itself, as a city, to which no bounds were assigned, but which was to fill the earth. Cyril: "For us God has raised a church, that truly holy and far-famed city, which Christ fortifies, consuming opponents by invisible powers, and filling it with His own glory, and as it were, standing in the midst of those who dwell in it. For He promised; "Lo, I am with you always even unto the end of the world." This holy city Isaiah mentioned: "thine eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation; a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>; and to her he saith, "enlarge the place of thy, tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitation; spare not; lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes. For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2-3</a>. For the church of Christ is widened and extended boundlessly, ever receiving countless souls who worship Him." Rup.: "What king or emperor could make walls so ample as to include the whole world? Yet, without this, it could not encircle that Jerusalem, the church which is diffused through the whole world. This Jerusalem, the pilgrim part of the heavenly Jerusalem, is, in this present world, inhabited without walls, not being contained in vile place or one nation. But in that world, where it is daily being removed hence, much more can there not, nor ought to be, nor is, any wall around, save the Lord, who is also the glory in the midst of it." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. this young man&#8212;So Zechariah is called as being still a youth when prophetically inspired [Grotius]. Or, he is so called in respect to his ministry or service (compare Nu 11:27; Jos 1:1) [Vatablus]. Naturally the "angel that talked with" Zechariah is desired to "speak to" him the further communications to be made from the Divine Being.<p>towns without walls for the multitude &#8230; Cattle&#8212;So many shall be its inhabitants that all could not be contained within the walls, but shall spread out in the open country around (Es 9:19); and so secure shall they be as not to need to shelter themselves and their cattle behind walls. So hereafter Judea is to be "the land of unwalled villages" (Eze 38:11). Spiritually, now the Church has extended herself beyond the walls (Eph 2:14, 15) of Mosaic ordinances and has spread from cities to country villages, whose inhabitants gave their Latin name (pagani) to pagans, as being the last in parting with heathenism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And said unto him; </span> or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And he said; </span> or, as the French, <span class="ital">Lequel lui dit, Which said unto him</span>: so it is plain that the Angel which now was going forth spake to that angel which came to meet him, or gave him orders what to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Run; </span> since you came so seasonably, hasten with all diligence, and from me tell that young man, Zechariah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jerusalem, </span> which hath so long lain in rubbish, which I once delighted in, which now seems desolate and hopeless, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall be inhabited, </span> filled with inhabitants, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as towns without walls; </span> the suburbs of it shall be as towns unwalled for greatness of extent, and for safety and freedom from enemies and danger: their own multitudes of men shall be some safeguard to them; and they shall have my presence, a better safeguard. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cattle, </span> brought thither for sacred uses, for sacrifices. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zechariah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And said unto him,....

The word <span class="accented">perazoth</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>, meaning "unwalled villages" where men dwelt "without walls, having neither bars nor gates." So <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-19.htm">Esther 9:19</a>, where it means, "country towns," in contrast to the metropolis, which was walled and fortified. The idea in the text is that Jerusalem in the future shall be so extended that walls shall no longer contain its inhabitants, but they shall spread themselves in the open country on every side. It is certain that the city did greatly increase in after time, if we may believe Aristeas's account in his famous letter to his brother Philocrates; and the annunciation of this prosperity would be a comfort to the prophet (comp. Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:04, 2). But no material increase of this nature satisfies the prophecy, which can only have its fulfilment in the spiritual Jerusalem, whose Builder is Christ, in whose light the nations of them that are saved shall walk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>, etc.; Isaiah 54:2, 3). This open condition implies not only extent, but peace and safety also. The reason of this quiet security is given in the next verse.

These five strophes are connected together, so as to form two larger divisions, by a refrain which closes the first and fourth, as well as by the promise explanatory of the threat in which the third and fifth strophes terminate; of which two divisions the first threatens the judgment of retribution upon the insatiableness of the Chaldaean in three woes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>), and the second in two woes the judgment of retribution upon his pride. Throughout the whole of the threatening prophecy the Chaldaean nation is embraced, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, in the ideal person of its ruler.<p>(Note: The unity of the threatening prophecy, which is brought out in the clearest manner in this formal arrangement, has been torn in pieces in the most violent manner by Hitzig, through his assumption that the oracle of God includes no more than <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4-8</a>, and that a second part is appended to it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-20</a>, in which the prophet expresses his own thoughts and feelings, first of all concerning king Jehoiakim (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-14</a>), and then concerning the Egyptians (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-20</a>). This hypothesis, of which Maurer observes quite correctly, Qua nulla unquam excogitata est infelicior, rests upon nothing more than the dogmatic assumption, that there is no such thing as prophecy effected by supernatural causality, and therefore Habakkuk cannot have spoken of Nebuchadnezzar's buildings before they were finished, or at any rate in progress. The two strophes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-14</a> contain nothing whatever that would not apply most perfectly to the Chaldaean, or that is not covered by what precedes and follows (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a> with 6b and 8a, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a> with 5b and 8a). "The strophe in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-11</a> contains the same fundamental thought as that expressed by Isaiah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-14</a> respecting the Chaldaean, viz., the description of his pride, which manifests itself in ambitious edifices founded upon the ruins of the prosperity of strangers" (Delitzsch). The resemblance between the contents of this strophe and the woe pronounced upon Jehoiakim by Jeremiah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13-17</a> may be very simply explained from the fact that Jehoiakim, like the Chaldaean, was a tyrant who occupied himself with the erection of large state buildings and fortifications, whereas the extermination of many nations does not apply in any respect to Jehoiakim. Lastly, there is no plausible ground whatever for referring the last two strophes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-20</a>) to the Egyptian, for the assertion that Habakkuk could not pass over the Egyptian in silence, unless he meant to confine himself to the Chaldaean, is a pure petitio principii; and to any unprejudiced mind the allusion to the Chaldaean in this verse is placed beyond all possible doubt by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>, where the devastation of Lebanon is also attributed to him, just as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-17.htm">Habakkuk 2:17</a> of our prophecy.)<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6-8</a><p>Introduction of the ode and first strophe. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>. "Will not all these lift up a proverb upon him, and a song, a riddle upon him? And men will say, Woe to him who increases what is not his own! For how long? and who loadeth himself with the burden of pledges. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-7.htm">Habakkuk 2:7</a>. Will not thy biters rise up suddenly, and thy destroyers wake up, and thou wilt become booty to them? <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>. For thou hast plundered many nations, all the rest of the nations will plunder thee, for the blood of men and wickedness on the earth, the city, and all its inhabitants." &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; is here, as everywhere else, equivalent to a confident assertion. "All these:" this evidently points back to "all nations" and "all people." Nevertheless the nations as such, or in pleno, are not meant, but simply the believers among them, who expect Jehovah to inflict judgment upon the Chaldaeans, and look forward to that judgment for the revelation of the glory of God. For the ode is prophetical in its nature, and is applicable to all times and all nations. Ma&#770;sha&#770;l is a sententious poem, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>, not a derisive song, for this subordinate meaning could only be derived from the context, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a> for example; and there is nothing to suggest it here. So, again, mel&#305;&#772;tsa&#770;h neither signifies a satirical song, nor an obscure enigmatical discourse, but, as Delitzsch has shown, from the first of the two primary meanings combined in the verb &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, lucere and lascivire, a brilliant oration, oratio splendida, from which &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; is used to denote an interpreter, so called, not from the obscurity of the speaking, but from his making the speech clear or intelligible. &#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1493; is in apposition to &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, adding the more precise definition, that the sayings contain enigmas relating to him (the Chaldaean). The enigmatical feature comes out more especially in the double meaning of &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-7.htm">Habakkuk 2:7</a>, and &#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>. &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; serves, like &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; elsewhere, as a direct introduction to the speech. The first woe applies to the insatiable rapacity of the Chaldaean. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;, who increases what does not belong to him, i.e., who seizes upon a large amount of the possessions of others. &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, for how long, sc. will he be able to do this with impunity; not "how long has he already done this" (Hitzig), for the words do not express exultation at the termination of the oppression, but are a sign appended to the woe, over the apparently interminable plunderings on the part of the Chaldaean. &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is also dependent upon ho&#772;i, since the defined participle which stands at the head of the cry of woe is generally followed by participles undefined, as though the former regulated the whole (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1</a>). At the same time, it might be taken as a simple declaration in itself, though still standing under the influence of the ho&#772;i; in which case &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; would have to be supplied in thought, like &#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1496;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>. And even in this instance the sentence is not subordinate to the preceding one, as Luther follows Rashi in assuming ("and still only heaps much slime upon himself"); but is co-ordinate, as the parallelism of the clauses and the meaning of &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496; require. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496; is probably chosen on account of the resemblance in sound to &#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, whilst it also covers an enigma or double entendre. Being formed from &#1506;&#1489;&#1496; (to give a pledge) by the repetition of the last radical, &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496; signifies the mass of pledges (pignorum captorum copia: Ges., Maurer, Delitzsch), not the load of guilt, either in a literal or a tropico-moral sense. The quantity of foreign property which the Chaldaean has accumulated is represented as a heavy mass of pledges, which he has taken from the nations like an unmerciful usurer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>), to point to the fact that he will be compelled to disgorge them in due time. &#1492;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, to make heavy, i.e., to lay a heavy load upon a person. The word &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496;, however, might form two words so far as the sound is concerned: &#1506;&#1489; &#1496;&#1497;&#1496;, cloud (i.e., mass) of dirt, which will cause his ruin as soon as it is discharged. This is the sense in which the Syriac has taken the word; and Jerome does the same, observing, considera quam eleganter multiplicatas divitias densum appellaverit lutum, no doubt according to a Jewish tradition, since Kimchi, Rashi, and Ab. Ezra take the word as a composite one, and merely differ as to the explanation of &#1506;&#1489;. Grammatically considered, this explanation is indeed untenable, since the Hebrew language has formed no appellative nomina composita; but the word is nevertheless enigmatical, because, when heard from the lips, it might be taken as two words, and understood in the sense indicated.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-7.htm">Habakkuk 2:7</a> the threatening ho&#772;i is still further developed. Will not thy biters arise? &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498;  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1498;, those who bite thee. In the description here given of the enemy as savage vipers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a>) there is also an enigmatical double entendre, which Delitzsch has admirably interpreted thus: "&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;," he says, "pointed to &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (interest). The latter, favoured by the idea of the Chaldaean as an unmerciful usurer, which is concentrated in &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496;, points to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, which is frequently connected with &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, and signifies usurious interest; and this again to the striking epithet &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;&#1501;, which is applied to those who have to inflict the divine retribution upon the Chaldaean. The prophet selected this to suggest the thought that there would come upon the Chaldaean those who would demand back with interest (neshek) the capital of which he had unrighteously taken possession, just as he had unmercifully taken the goods of the nations from them by usury and pawn." &#1497;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1497;&#1511;&#1509;, they will awake, viz., &#1502;&#1494;&#1506;&#1494;&#1506;&#1498;, those who shake or rouse thee up. &#1494;&#1506;&#1494;&#1506;, pilel of &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;, is used in Arabic of the wind (to shake the tree); hence, as in this case, it was employed to denote shaking up or scaring away from a possession, as is often done, for example, by a creditor (Hitzig, Delitzsch). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is an intensive plural.<p>So far as this threat applies to the Chaldaeans, it was executed by the Medes and Persians, who destroyed the Chaldaean empire. But the threat has a much more extensive application. This is evident, apart from other proofs, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a> itself, according to which the whole of the remnant of the nations is to inflict the retribution. Go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m rabb&#305;&#772;m, "many nations:" this is not to be taken as an antithesis to kol-haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m (all nations) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, since "all nations" are simply many nations, as kol is not to be taken in its absolute sense, but simply in a relative sense, as denoting all the nations that lie within the prophet's horizon, as having entered the arena of history. Through &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, which is placed at the head of the concluding clause without a copula, the antithesis to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is sharply brought out, and the idea of the righteous retaliation distinctly expressed. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the whole remnant of the nations, is not all the rest, with the exception of the one Chaldaean, for yether always denotes the remnant which is left after the deduction of a portion; nor does it mean all the rest of the nations, who are spared and not subjugated, in distinction from the plundered and subjugated nations, as Hitzig with many others imagine, and in proof of which he adduces the fact that the overthrow of the Chaldaeans was effected by nations that had not been subdued. But, as Delitzsch has correctly observed, this view makes the prophet contradict not only himself, but the whole of the prophetic view of the world-wide dominion of Nebuchadnezzar. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, the Chaldaean has grasped to himself the dominion over all nations, and consequently there cannot be any nations left that he has not plundered. Moreover, the Chaldaean, or Nebuchadnezzar as the head of the Chaldaean kingdom, appears in prophecy (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7-8</a>), as he does in history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-38.htm">Daniel 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>) throughout, as the ruler of the world in the highest sense, who has subjugated all nations and kingdoms round about, and compelled them to serve him. These nations include the Medes and Elamites ( equals  Persians), to whom the future conquest of Babylon is attributed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-28.htm">Jeremiah 51:28</a>. They are both mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a> among the nations, to whom the prophet is to reach the cup of wrath from the hand of Jehovah; and the kingdom of Elam especially is threatened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>. with the destruction of its power, and dispersion to all four winds. In these two prophecies, indeed, Nebuchadnezzar is not expressly mentioned by name as the executor of the judgment of wrath; but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a> this may plainly be inferred from the context, partly from the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, Judah with its inhabitants, and all nations round about, are to be given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, and partly from the fact that in the list of the nations enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18-26</a> the king of Sesach (i.e., Babel) is mentioned as he who is to drink the cup "after them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>). The expression 'acha&#774;re&#772;hem (after them) shows very clearly that the judgment upon the nations previously mentioned, and therefore also upon the kings of Elam and Media, is to occur while the Chaldaean rule continues, i.e., is to be executed by the Chaldaeans. This may, in fact, be inferred, so far as the prophecy respecting Elam in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>. is concerned, from the circumstance that Jeremiah's prophecies with regard to foreign nations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46-51</a> are merely expansions of the summary announcement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-19.htm">Jeremiah 25:19-26</a>, and is also confirmed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, inasmuch as Elam is mentioned there immediately after Asshur in the list of kings and nations that have sunk to the lower regions before Egypt. And if even this prophecy has a much wider meaning, like that concerning Elam in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>, and the elegy over Egypt, which Ezekiel strikes up, is expanded into a threatening prophecy concerning the heathen generally (see Kliefoth, Ezech. p. 303), this further reference presupposes the historical fulfilment which the threatening words of prophecy have received through the judgment inflicted by the Chaldaeans upon all the nations mentioned, and has in this its real foundation and soil.<p>History also harmonizes with this prophetic announcement. The arguments adduced by Hvernick (Daniel, p. 547ff.) to prove that Nebuchadnezzar did not extend his conquests to Elam, and neither subdued this province nor Media, are not conclusive. The fact that after the fall of Nineveh the conquerors, Nabopolassar of Babylonia, and Cyaxares the king of Media, divided the fallen Assyrian kingdom between them, the former receiving the western provinces, and the latter the eastern, does not preclude the possibility of Nebuchadnezzar, the founder of the Chaldaean empire, having made war upon the Median kingdom, and brought it into subjection. There is no historical testimony, however, to the further assertion, that Nebuchadnezzar was only concerned to extend his kingdom towards the west, that his conquests were all of them in the lands situated there, and gave him so much to do that he could not possibly think of extending his eastern frontier. It is true that the opposite of this cannot be inferred from Strabo, xvi. 1, 18;<p>(Note: This passage is quoted by Hitzig (Ezech. p. 251) as a proof that Elam made war upon the Babylonians, and, indeed, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>, an unsuccessful war. But Strabo speaks of a war between the Elymaeans (Elamites) and the Babylonians and Susians, which M. v. Niebuhr (p. 210) very properly assigns to the period of the alliance between Media (as possessor of Susa) and Babylon.)<p>but it may be inferred, as M. v. Niebuhr (Gesch. Assurs, pp. 211-12) has said, from the fact that according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27</a> and 28, at the beginning of Zedekiah's reign, and therefore not very long after Nebuchadnezzar had conquered Jerusalem in the time of Jehoiachin, and restored order in southern Syria in the most energetic manner, the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, entered into negotiations with Zedekiah for a joint expedition against Nebuchadnezzar. M. v. Niebuhr infers from this that troublous times set in at that period for Nebuchadnezzar, and that this sudden change in the situation of affairs was connected with the death of Cyaxares, and leads to the conjecture that Nebuchadnezzar, who had sworn fealty to Cyaxares, refused at his death to do homage to his successor; for fidelity to a father-in-law, with whose help the kingdom was founded, would assume a very different character if it was renewed to his successor. Babel was too powerful to accept any such enfeoffment as this. And even if Nebuchadnezzar was not a vassal, there could not be a more suitable opportunity for war with Media than that afforded by a change of government, since kingdoms in the East are so easily shaken by the death of a great prince. And there certainly was no lack of inducement to enter upon a war with Media. Elam, for example, from its very situation, and on account of the restlessness of its inhabitants, must have been a constant apple of discord. This combination acquires extreme probability, partly from the fact that Jeremiah's prophecy concerning Elam, in which that nation is threatened with the destruction of its power and dispersion to all four winds, was first uttered at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>), whereas the rest of his prophecies against foreign nations date from an earlier period, and that against Babel is the only one which falls later, namely, in the fourth year of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>), which appears to point to the fact that at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign things were brewing in Elam which might lead to his ruin. And it is favoured in part by the account in the book of Judith of a war between Nabuchodonosor (Nebuchadnezzar) and Media, which terminated victoriously according to the Rec. vulg. in the twelfth year of his reign, since this account is hardly altogether a fictitious one. These prophetic and historical testimonies may be regarded as quite sufficient, considering the universally scanty accounts of the Chaldaean monarchy given by the Greeks and Romans, to warrant us in assuming without hesitation, as M. v. Niebuhr has done, that between the ninth and twentieth years of Nebuchadnezzar's reign - namely, at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign - the former had to make war not only with Elam, but with Media also, and that it is to this eastern war that we should have to attribute the commotion in Syria.<p>From all this we may see that there is no necessity to explain "all the remnant of the nations" as relating to the remainder of the nations that had not been subjugated, but that we may understand it as signifying the remnant of the nations plundered and subjugated by the Chaldaeans (as is done by the lxx, Theodoret, Delitzsch, and others), which is the only explanation in harmony with the usage of the language. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a> yether haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m denotes the Canaanitish nations left after the war of extermination; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a> yether ha&#770;&#8219;a&#770;m signifies the remnant of the nation left after the previous conquest of the city, and the carrying away of half its inhabitants. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a> yether go&#772;i is synonymous with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, and our &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3-4</a>. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;: on account of the human blood unjustly shed, and on account of the wickedness on the earth (cha&#774;mas with the Genesis obj. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10</a>). 'Erets without an article is not the holy land, but the earth generally; and so the city (qirya&#770;h, which is still dependent upon cha&#774;mas) is not Jerusalem, nor any one particular city, but, with indefinite generality, "cities." The two clauses are parallel, cities and their inhabitants corresponding to men and the earth. The Chaldaean is depicted as one who gathers men and nations in his net (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14-17</a>). And so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a> he is called a hammer of the whole earth, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a> a cup of reeling, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a> the destroyer of the whole earth. </body></html>
