Many nations in that day would renounce idolatry, and God will own those for his people who join him with purpose of heart. Glorious times are foretold as a prophecy of our Lord's coming and kingdom. God is about to do something unexpected, and very surprising, and to plead his people's cause, which had long seemed neglected. Silently submit to his holy will, and patiently wait the event; assured that God will complete all his work. He will ere long come to judgment, to complete the salvation of his people, and to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And many nations shall join themselves - cleaving to Him by a close union. Isaiah had so spoken of single proselytes <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-6</a>; Jeremiah had used the word of Israel's self-exhortation after the return from Babylon; "going and weeping," they shall go and seek the Lord their God, saying, "Come and let us join ourselves unto the Lord, in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten" <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4-5</a>. This Zechariah now predicts of "many nations." The Jews were scarcely half-restored themselves, a mere handful. They had wrought no conversions among the pagan, yet prophecy continues its unbroken voice, "many nations shall join themselves unto the Lord."<p>And shall be My people - Literally, "be to Me a people." This is exactly the history of the Christian church, unity amid diversity; many nations still retaining their national existence, yet owned by God as one people and His own. The words are those in which God adopted Israel in Egypt; "I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be your God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>. This was the covenant with them, "that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the Lord thy God, that He may establish thee today for a people unto Himself, and that he may be unto thee a God" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-12.htm">Deuteronomy 29:12-13</a>, add <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-9.htm">Deuteronomy 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-22.htm">1 Chronicles 17:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-16.htm">2 Chronicles 23:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm">Jeremiah 11:4</a>). The contrary was the title of the pagan, "not a people; with whom God said, I will move Israel to jealousy" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. The closeness of union Jeremiah expresses; "As the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to Me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the Lord, that they might be unto Me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-11.htm">Jeremiah 13:11</a>.

Cyrus, Darius, Alexander, Ptolemy Philadelphus, Augustus, and Tiberius, paid respect to the temple by sending offerings [Grotius]. But all this is but a shadow of the future conversion of the Gentiles which shall result from Jehovah dwelling in Jerusalem (Ps 102:15, 16; Php 2:10, 11).<p>sent me unto thee&#8212;"unto thee" is here added to the same formula (Zec 2:9). Zion first shall "know (generally) that Jehovah of hosts hath sent" Messiah, by the judgments inflicted by Him on her foes. Subsequently, she shall know experimentally the particular sending of Messiah unto her. Jehovah here says, "I will dwell," and then that Jehovah of hosts sent Him; therefore Jehovah the Sender and Jehovah the Sent must be One.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Many nations, </span> and <span class="ital">great</span>, Heb; it implieth both multitudes and greatness of nations; or, heathen and Gentiles, as the word beareth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall be joined to the Lord; </span> become proselytes, inquire for, adhere to, and worship the God of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In that day; </span> when God shall lift up his hand for his people against their enemies, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-17.htm" title="And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day.

"Woe to him who buildeth cities with blood, and foundeth castles with injustice. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>. For the earth will be filled with knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea." The earnest endeavour of the Chaldaean to found his dynasty in permanency through evil gain, manifested itself also in the building of cities with the blood and sweat of the subjugated nations. &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; and &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; are synonymous, and are used in the singular with indefinite generality, like &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>. The preposition &#1489;, attached to &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, denotes the means employed to attain the end, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>. This was murder, bloodshed, transportation, and tyranny of every kind. Ko&#772;ne&#772;n is not a participle with the Mem dropped, but a perfect; the address, which was opened with a participle, being continued in the finite tense (cf. Ewald, 350, a). With <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-13.htm">Habakkuk 2:13</a> the address takes a different turn from that which it has in the preceding woes. Whereas there the woe is always more fully expanded in the central verse by an exposition of the wrong, we have here a statement that it is of Jehovah, i.e., is ordered or inflicted by Him, that the nations weary themselves for the fire. The &#1493; before &#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; introduces the declaration of what it is that comes from Jehovah. &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (is it not? behold!) are connected together, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-26.htm">2 Chronicles 25:26</a>, to point to what follows as something great that was floating before the mind of the prophet. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, literally, for the need of the fire (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-13.htm">Nahum 2:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-16.htm">Isaiah 40:16</a>). They labour for the fire, i.e., that the fire may devour the cities that have been built with severe exertion, which exhausts the strength of the nations. So far they weary themselves for vanity, since the buildings are one day to fall into ruins, or be destroyed. Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-58.htm">Jeremiah 51:58</a>) has very suitably applied these words to the destruction of Babylon. This wearying of themselves for vanity is determined by Jehovah, for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>) the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah. That this may be the case, the kingdom of the world, which is hostile to the Lord and His glory, must be destroyed. This promise therefore involves a threat directed against the Chaldaean. His usurped glory shall be destroyed, that the glory of Jehovah of Sabaoth, i.e., of the God of the universe, may fill the whole earth. The thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a> is formed after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>, with trifling alterations, partly substantial, partly only formal. The choice of the niphal &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; instead of the &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; of Isaiah refers to the actual fact, and is induced in both passages by the different turn given to the thought. In Isaiah, for example, this thought closes the description of the glory and blessedness of the Messianic kingdom in its perfected state. The earth is then full of the knowledge of the Lord, and the peace throughout all nature which has already been promised is one fruit of that knowledge. In Habakkuk, on the other hand, this knowledge is only secured through the overthrow of the kingdom of the world, and consequently only thereby will the earth be filled with it, and that not with the knowledge of Jehovah (as in Isaiah), but with the knowledge of His glory (&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1497;), which is manifested in the judgment and overthrow of all ungodly powers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, compared with the primary passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1497;&#1497; is "the &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; of Jehovah, which includes His right of majesty over the whole earth" (Delitzsch). &#1497;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1501; is altered in form, but not in sense, from the &#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of Isaiah; and &#1497;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is to be taken relatively, since &#1499; is only used as a preposition before a noun or participle, and not like a conjunction before a whole sentence (comp. Ewald, 360, a, with 337, c). &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1512; is an infinitive, not a noun, with the preposition &#1500;; for &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; is construed with the accus. rei, lit., the earth will be filled with the acknowledging. The water of the sea is a figure denoting overflowing abundance. </body></html>
