God notices the extent of his church, and will take care that whatever number of guests are brought to the wedding-supper, there shall be room. This vision means well to Jerusalem. The walls of a city, as they defend it, so they straiten its inhabitants; but Jerusalem shall be extended as freely as if it had no walls at all, yet shall be as safe as if it had the strongest walls. In the church of God there yet is room for other multitudes, more than man can number. None shall be refused who trust in Christ; and He never shuts out from heaven one true member of the church on earth. God will be a Wall of fire round them, which can neither be broken through nor undermined, nor can it be assailed without danger to those who attack. This vision was to have its full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended by admitting the Gentiles into it; and which has the Son of God for its Prince and Protector; especially in the glorious times yet to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I, Myself in My own Being, will be to her a wall of fire - Not protection only, an inner circle around her, however near an enemy might press in upon her, but destructive to her enemies. Isaiah says, "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise in judgment against thee thou shalt condemn" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>. Its defense, Isaiah says, shall be immaterial.

So that she needs no other wall to secure her, the power of God encompassing her about as the mountains did Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a> and he being as a wall of fire to terrify and destroy her enemies; for our God is a consuming fire, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>. Drusius thinks it is a metaphor taken from travellers in some countries, who kindle fires about their tents, to keep off lions, and other beasts of prey; and observes of lions particularly, that they are exceedingly terrified by fire; for which he refers to John Leo in his description of Africa; and Pliny makes (e) mention of several things that are terrifying to them, but especially fires, he says; and so Dr. Shaw (f), of late, speaking of the lions in Barbary, remarks, fire is what they are the most afraid of; yet, notwithstanding all the precautions of the Arabs in this respect, with others he takes notice of, it frequently happens that these ravenous beasts, outbraving all those terrors, will leap into the midst of an enclosure or fold, and drag from thence a sheep, or a goat; and Tavernier (g) tells a story, by which he thinks it appears to be a vulgar error that lions will not come near the fire; though the relation itself shows it to be not only a received opinion, but a common custom to light fires in the night, to preserve from lions: his story is, <p>"a party of Dutch soldiers, under the command of a serjeant, far advanced in the country (about the Cape of Good Hope), and night coming on, they made a great fire, as well to keep themselves from the lions, as to warm themselves, and so lay down to sleep round about it; being asleep, a lion seized one of the soldier's arms, which with difficulty was got out, after the lion was shot;'' <p>but this seems to be the case, when these creatures are dreadfully hunger bitten; however, be it as it will, God is the sure and safe protection of his people; who went before the people of Israel in a pillar of a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, when they passed through a terrible wilderness, in which were beasts of prey; and surrounded Elisha with horses and chariots of fire, when the king of Syria sent a large host to take him; so that he could say, to encourage his servant, "they that be for us are more than they that be with them", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15</a> who seem to be angels; and the Jews (h) here interpret it of the family of God, his angels, made a wall to Jerusalem to preserve it; the cherubim and a flaming sword, set to keep the garden of Eden, were, according to Lactantius (i), a wall of fire about it; for (he says), when God cast man out of paradise, he walled it about with fire: but that was that man might not enter in; but here he himself is a wall of fire, that his people may be safe; hence they have no reason to fear the wrath of their enemies, the most fierce and furious, savage and cruel, comparable to lions, bears, &amp;c.; for, if God is for them, on their side, and on all sides of them, who can be against them to any purpose? The Targum paraphrases it, <p>"my Word shall be unto her, saith the Lord, as a wall of fire encompassing her round about:'' <p>and will be the glory in the midst of her: appear glorious in her, be glorified in her, and by her, and be her glory, and make her glorious; as the Lord does by granting his gracious presence with his church and people, in his word and ordinances; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>. <p>(e) Nat.

These five strophes are connected together, so as to form two larger divisions, by a refrain which closes the first and fourth, as well as by the promise explanatory of the threat in which the third and fifth strophes terminate; of which two divisions the first threatens the judgment of retribution upon the insatiableness of the Chaldaean in three woes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>), and the second in two woes the judgment of retribution upon his pride. Throughout the whole of the threatening prophecy the Chaldaean nation is embraced, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, in the ideal person of its ruler.<p>(Note: The unity of the threatening prophecy, which is brought out in the clearest manner in this formal arrangement, has been torn in pieces in the most violent manner by Hitzig, through his assumption that the oracle of God includes no more than <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4-8</a>, and that a second part is appended to it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-20</a>, in which the prophet expresses his own thoughts and feelings, first of all concerning king Jehoiakim (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-14</a>), and then concerning the Egyptians (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-20</a>). This hypothesis, of which Maurer observes quite correctly, Qua nulla unquam excogitata est infelicior, rests upon nothing more than the dogmatic assumption, that there is no such thing as prophecy effected by supernatural causality, and therefore Habakkuk cannot have spoken of Nebuchadnezzar's buildings before they were finished, or at any rate in progress. The two strophes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-14</a> contain nothing whatever that would not apply most perfectly to the Chaldaean, or that is not covered by what precedes and follows (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a> with 6b and 8a, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a> with 5b and 8a). "The strophe in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9-11</a> contains the same fundamental thought as that expressed by Isaiah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-14</a> respecting the Chaldaean, viz., the description of his pride, which manifests itself in ambitious edifices founded upon the ruins of the prosperity of strangers" (Delitzsch). The resemblance between the contents of this strophe and the woe pronounced upon Jehoiakim by Jeremiah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13-17</a> may be very simply explained from the fact that Jehoiakim, like the Chaldaean, was a tyrant who occupied himself with the erection of large state buildings and fortifications, whereas the extermination of many nations does not apply in any respect to Jehoiakim. Lastly, there is no plausible ground whatever for referring the last two strophes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-20</a>) to the Egyptian, for the assertion that Habakkuk could not pass over the Egyptian in silence, unless he meant to confine himself to the Chaldaean, is a pure petitio principii; and to any unprejudiced mind the allusion to the Chaldaean in this verse is placed beyond all possible doubt by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>, where the devastation of Lebanon is also attributed to him, just as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-17.htm">Habakkuk 2:17</a> of our prophecy.)<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6-8</a><p>Introduction of the ode and first strophe. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>. "Will not all these lift up a proverb upon him, and a song, a riddle upon him? And men will say, Woe to him who increases what is not his own! For how long? and who loadeth himself with the burden of pledges. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-7.htm">Habakkuk 2:7</a>. Will not thy biters rise up suddenly, and thy destroyers wake up, and thou wilt become booty to them? <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>. For thou hast plundered many nations, all the rest of the nations will plunder thee, for the blood of men and wickedness on the earth, the city, and all its inhabitants." &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; is here, as everywhere else, equivalent to a confident assertion. "All these:" this evidently points back to "all nations" and "all people." Nevertheless the nations as such, or in pleno, are not meant, but simply the believers among them, who expect Jehovah to inflict judgment upon the Chaldaeans, and look forward to that judgment for the revelation of the glory of God. For the ode is prophetical in its nature, and is applicable to all times and all nations. Ma&#770;sha&#770;l is a sententious poem, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>, not a derisive song, for this subordinate meaning could only be derived from the context, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a> for example; and there is nothing to suggest it here. So, again, mel&#305;&#772;tsa&#770;h neither signifies a satirical song, nor an obscure enigmatical discourse, but, as Delitzsch has shown, from the first of the two primary meanings combined in the verb &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, lucere and lascivire, a brilliant oration, oratio splendida, from which &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; is used to denote an interpreter, so called, not from the obscurity of the speaking, but from his making the speech clear or intelligible. &#1495;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1493; is in apposition to &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, adding the more precise definition, that the sayings contain enigmas relating to him (the Chaldaean). The enigmatical feature comes out more especially in the double meaning of &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-7.htm">Habakkuk 2:7</a>, and &#1511;&#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>. &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; serves, like &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; elsewhere, as a direct introduction to the speech. The first woe applies to the insatiable rapacity of the Chaldaean. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493;, who increases what does not belong to him, i.e., who seizes upon a large amount of the possessions of others. &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, for how long, sc. will he be able to do this with impunity; not "how long has he already done this" (Hitzig), for the words do not express exultation at the termination of the oppression, but are a sign appended to the woe, over the apparently interminable plunderings on the part of the Chaldaean. &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; is also dependent upon ho&#772;i, since the defined participle which stands at the head of the cry of woe is generally followed by participles undefined, as though the former regulated the whole (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1</a>). At the same time, it might be taken as a simple declaration in itself, though still standing under the influence of the ho&#772;i; in which case &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; would have to be supplied in thought, like &#1493;&#1495;&#1493;&#1496;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>. And even in this instance the sentence is not subordinate to the preceding one, as Luther follows Rashi in assuming ("and still only heaps much slime upon himself"); but is co-ordinate, as the parallelism of the clauses and the meaning of &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496; require. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496; is probably chosen on account of the resemblance in sound to &#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, whilst it also covers an enigma or double entendre. Being formed from &#1506;&#1489;&#1496; (to give a pledge) by the repetition of the last radical, &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496; signifies the mass of pledges (pignorum captorum copia: Ges., Maurer, Delitzsch), not the load of guilt, either in a literal or a tropico-moral sense. The quantity of foreign property which the Chaldaean has accumulated is represented as a heavy mass of pledges, which he has taken from the nations like an unmerciful usurer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>), to point to the fact that he will be compelled to disgorge them in due time. &#1492;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, to make heavy, i.e., to lay a heavy load upon a person. The word &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496;, however, might form two words so far as the sound is concerned: &#1506;&#1489; &#1496;&#1497;&#1496;, cloud (i.e., mass) of dirt, which will cause his ruin as soon as it is discharged. This is the sense in which the Syriac has taken the word; and Jerome does the same, observing, considera quam eleganter multiplicatas divitias densum appellaverit lutum, no doubt according to a Jewish tradition, since Kimchi, Rashi, and Ab. Ezra take the word as a composite one, and merely differ as to the explanation of &#1506;&#1489;. Grammatically considered, this explanation is indeed untenable, since the Hebrew language has formed no appellative nomina composita; but the word is nevertheless enigmatical, because, when heard from the lips, it might be taken as two words, and understood in the sense indicated.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-7.htm">Habakkuk 2:7</a> the threatening ho&#772;i is still further developed. Will not thy biters arise? &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498;  equals  &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1498;, those who bite thee. In the description here given of the enemy as savage vipers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a>) there is also an enigmatical double entendre, which Delitzsch has admirably interpreted thus: "&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;," he says, "pointed to &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (interest). The latter, favoured by the idea of the Chaldaean as an unmerciful usurer, which is concentrated in &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497;&#1496;, points to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, which is frequently connected with &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, and signifies usurious interest; and this again to the striking epithet &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;&#1501;, which is applied to those who have to inflict the divine retribution upon the Chaldaean. The prophet selected this to suggest the thought that there would come upon the Chaldaean those who would demand back with interest (neshek) the capital of which he had unrighteously taken possession, just as he had unmercifully taken the goods of the nations from them by usury and pawn." &#1497;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1497;&#1511;&#1509;, they will awake, viz., &#1502;&#1494;&#1506;&#1494;&#1506;&#1498;, those who shake or rouse thee up. &#1494;&#1506;&#1494;&#1506;, pilel of &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;, is used in Arabic of the wind (to shake the tree); hence, as in this case, it was employed to denote shaking up or scaring away from a possession, as is often done, for example, by a creditor (Hitzig, Delitzsch). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is an intensive plural.<p>So far as this threat applies to the Chaldaeans, it was executed by the Medes and Persians, who destroyed the Chaldaean empire. But the threat has a much more extensive application. This is evident, apart from other proofs, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a> itself, according to which the whole of the remnant of the nations is to inflict the retribution. Go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m rabb&#305;&#772;m, "many nations:" this is not to be taken as an antithesis to kol-haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m (all nations) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, since "all nations" are simply many nations, as kol is not to be taken in its absolute sense, but simply in a relative sense, as denoting all the nations that lie within the prophet's horizon, as having entered the arena of history. Through &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, which is placed at the head of the concluding clause without a copula, the antithesis to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is sharply brought out, and the idea of the righteous retaliation distinctly expressed. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, the whole remnant of the nations, is not all the rest, with the exception of the one Chaldaean, for yether always denotes the remnant which is left after the deduction of a portion; nor does it mean all the rest of the nations, who are spared and not subjugated, in distinction from the plundered and subjugated nations, as Hitzig with many others imagine, and in proof of which he adduces the fact that the overthrow of the Chaldaeans was effected by nations that had not been subdued. But, as Delitzsch has correctly observed, this view makes the prophet contradict not only himself, but the whole of the prophetic view of the world-wide dominion of Nebuchadnezzar. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, the Chaldaean has grasped to himself the dominion over all nations, and consequently there cannot be any nations left that he has not plundered. Moreover, the Chaldaean, or Nebuchadnezzar as the head of the Chaldaean kingdom, appears in prophecy (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7-8</a>), as he does in history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-38.htm">Daniel 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>) throughout, as the ruler of the world in the highest sense, who has subjugated all nations and kingdoms round about, and compelled them to serve him. These nations include the Medes and Elamites ( equals  Persians), to whom the future conquest of Babylon is attributed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-28.htm">Jeremiah 51:28</a>. They are both mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a> among the nations, to whom the prophet is to reach the cup of wrath from the hand of Jehovah; and the kingdom of Elam especially is threatened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>. with the destruction of its power, and dispersion to all four winds. In these two prophecies, indeed, Nebuchadnezzar is not expressly mentioned by name as the executor of the judgment of wrath; but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a> this may plainly be inferred from the context, partly from the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, Judah with its inhabitants, and all nations round about, are to be given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, and partly from the fact that in the list of the nations enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18-26</a> the king of Sesach (i.e., Babel) is mentioned as he who is to drink the cup "after them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>). The expression 'acha&#774;re&#772;hem (after them) shows very clearly that the judgment upon the nations previously mentioned, and therefore also upon the kings of Elam and Media, is to occur while the Chaldaean rule continues, i.e., is to be executed by the Chaldaeans. This may, in fact, be inferred, so far as the prophecy respecting Elam in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>. is concerned, from the circumstance that Jeremiah's prophecies with regard to foreign nations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46-51</a> are merely expansions of the summary announcement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-19.htm">Jeremiah 25:19-26</a>, and is also confirmed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, inasmuch as Elam is mentioned there immediately after Asshur in the list of kings and nations that have sunk to the lower regions before Egypt. And if even this prophecy has a much wider meaning, like that concerning Elam in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>, and the elegy over Egypt, which Ezekiel strikes up, is expanded into a threatening prophecy concerning the heathen generally (see Kliefoth, Ezech. p. 303), this further reference presupposes the historical fulfilment which the threatening words of prophecy have received through the judgment inflicted by the Chaldaeans upon all the nations mentioned, and has in this its real foundation and soil.<p>History also harmonizes with this prophetic announcement. The arguments adduced by Hvernick (Daniel, p. 547ff.) to prove that Nebuchadnezzar did not extend his conquests to Elam, and neither subdued this province nor Media, are not conclusive. The fact that after the fall of Nineveh the conquerors, Nabopolassar of Babylonia, and Cyaxares the king of Media, divided the fallen Assyrian kingdom between them, the former receiving the western provinces, and the latter the eastern, does not preclude the possibility of Nebuchadnezzar, the founder of the Chaldaean empire, having made war upon the Median kingdom, and brought it into subjection. There is no historical testimony, however, to the further assertion, that Nebuchadnezzar was only concerned to extend his kingdom towards the west, that his conquests were all of them in the lands situated there, and gave him so much to do that he could not possibly think of extending his eastern frontier. It is true that the opposite of this cannot be inferred from Strabo, xvi. 1, 18;<p>(Note: This passage is quoted by Hitzig (Ezech. p. 251) as a proof that Elam made war upon the Babylonians, and, indeed, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>, an unsuccessful war. But Strabo speaks of a war between the Elymaeans (Elamites) and the Babylonians and Susians, which M. v. Niebuhr (p. 210) very properly assigns to the period of the alliance between Media (as possessor of Susa) and Babylon.)<p>but it may be inferred, as M. v. Niebuhr (Gesch. Assurs, pp. 211-12) has said, from the fact that according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27</a> and 28, at the beginning of Zedekiah's reign, and therefore not very long after Nebuchadnezzar had conquered Jerusalem in the time of Jehoiachin, and restored order in southern Syria in the most energetic manner, the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, entered into negotiations with Zedekiah for a joint expedition against Nebuchadnezzar. M. v. Niebuhr infers from this that troublous times set in at that period for Nebuchadnezzar, and that this sudden change in the situation of affairs was connected with the death of Cyaxares, and leads to the conjecture that Nebuchadnezzar, who had sworn fealty to Cyaxares, refused at his death to do homage to his successor; for fidelity to a father-in-law, with whose help the kingdom was founded, would assume a very different character if it was renewed to his successor. Babel was too powerful to accept any such enfeoffment as this. And even if Nebuchadnezzar was not a vassal, there could not be a more suitable opportunity for war with Media than that afforded by a change of government, since kingdoms in the East are so easily shaken by the death of a great prince. And there certainly was no lack of inducement to enter upon a war with Media. Elam, for example, from its very situation, and on account of the restlessness of its inhabitants, must have been a constant apple of discord. This combination acquires extreme probability, partly from the fact that Jeremiah's prophecy concerning Elam, in which that nation is threatened with the destruction of its power and dispersion to all four winds, was first uttered at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>), whereas the rest of his prophecies against foreign nations date from an earlier period, and that against Babel is the only one which falls later, namely, in the fourth year of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>), which appears to point to the fact that at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign things were brewing in Elam which might lead to his ruin. And it is favoured in part by the account in the book of Judith of a war between Nabuchodonosor (Nebuchadnezzar) and Media, which terminated victoriously according to the Rec. vulg. in the twelfth year of his reign, since this account is hardly altogether a fictitious one. These prophetic and historical testimonies may be regarded as quite sufficient, considering the universally scanty accounts of the Chaldaean monarchy given by the Greeks and Romans, to warrant us in assuming without hesitation, as M. v. Niebuhr has done, that between the ninth and twentieth years of Nebuchadnezzar's reign - namely, at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign - the former had to make war not only with Elam, but with Media also, and that it is to this eastern war that we should have to attribute the commotion in Syria.<p>From all this we may see that there is no necessity to explain "all the remnant of the nations" as relating to the remainder of the nations that had not been subjugated, but that we may understand it as signifying the remnant of the nations plundered and subjugated by the Chaldaeans (as is done by the lxx, Theodoret, Delitzsch, and others), which is the only explanation in harmony with the usage of the language. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a> yether haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m denotes the Canaanitish nations left after the war of extermination; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a> yether ha&#770;&#8219;a&#770;m signifies the remnant of the nation left after the previous conquest of the city, and the carrying away of half its inhabitants. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a> yether go&#772;i is synonymous with &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, and our &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3-4</a>. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;: on account of the human blood unjustly shed, and on account of the wickedness on the earth (cha&#774;mas with the Genesis obj. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10</a>). 'Erets without an article is not the holy land, but the earth generally; and so the city (qirya&#770;h, which is still dependent upon cha&#774;mas) is not Jerusalem, nor any one particular city, but, with indefinite generality, "cities." The two clauses are parallel, cities and their inhabitants corresponding to men and the earth. The Chaldaean is depicted as one who gathers men and nations in his net (<a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14-17</a>). And so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-23.htm">Jeremiah 50:23</a> he is called a hammer of the whole earth, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a> a cup of reeling, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a> the destroyer of the whole earth. </body></html>
