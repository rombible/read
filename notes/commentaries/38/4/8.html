Though the instruments be weak and unlikely, yet God often chooses such, to bring about great things by them. Let not the dawning light be despised; it will shine more and more to the perfect day. Those who despaired of finishing the work, shall rejoice when they see Zerubbabel giving directions what to do, and taking care that the work be done. It is a comfort to us that the same all-wise, almighty Providence, which governs the earth, is in particular conversant about the church. All that have the plummet in their hands, must look up to the eyes of the Lord, have constant regard to Divine Providence, act in dependence on its guidance and submission to its disposals. Let us fix our faith on Christ, and view Him carrying on his work according to his own glorious plan, and daily bringing his spiritual building nearer to completion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the word of the Lord - Keil: "This word of the Lord is not addressed through 'the interpreting angel,' but direct from the Lord, and that through the 'Angel of the Lord' . For though in the first instance the words, "the hands of Zerubbabel etc.," relate to the building of the material temple, and announce its completion through Zerubbabel yet the inference, "and thou shalt know theft the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you," shows that the meaning is not exhausted thereby, but that here too this building is mentioned only as a type of the building of the spiritual temple ; and the completion of the typical temple is but a pledge of the completion of the true temple. For not through the completion of the material temple, but only through the building of the kingdom of God, shadowed forth by it, can Judah know, that the Angel of the Lord was sent to him." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. All mountain-like obstacles (Isa 40:4; 49:11) in Zerubbabel's way shall be removed, so that the crowning top-stone shall be put on, and the completion of the work be acknowledged as wholly of "grace." Antitypically, the antichristian last foe of Israel, the obstacle preventing her establishment in Palestine, about to be crushed before Messiah, is probably meant (Jer 51:25; Da 2:34, 44; Mt 21:44).<p>bring forth the head-stone&#8212;Primarily, bring it forth from the place where it was chiselled and give it to the workmen to put on the top of the building. It was customary for chief magistrates to lay the foundation, and also the crowning top-stone (compare Ezr 3:10). Antitypically, the reference is to the time when the full number of the spiritual Church shall be completed, and also when "all Israel shall be saved" (compare Ro 11:26; Heb 11:40; 12:22, 23; Re 7:4-9).<p>Grace, grace&#8212;The repetition expresses, Grace from first to last (Isa 26:3, Margin). Thus the Jews are urged to pray perseveringly and earnestly that the same grace which completed it may always preserve it. "Shoutings" of acclamation accompanied the foundation of the literal temple (Ezr 3:11, 13). So shoutings of "Hosanna" greeted the Saviour in entering Jerusalem (Mt 21:9), when about to complete the purchase of salvation by His death: His Body being the second temple, or place of God's inhabitation (Joh 2:20, 21). So when the full number of the saints and of Israel is complete, and God shall say, "It is done," then again shall "a great voice of much people in heaven" attribute all to the "grace" of God, saying, "Alleluia! Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God" (Re 19:1, 6). Ps 118:22 regards Him as "the head-stone of the corner," that is, the foundation-stone. Compare the angels acclamations at His birth, Lu 2:14. Here it is the top-stone. Messiah is not only the "Author," but also the Finisher (Heb 12:2). "Grace" is ascribed "unto it," that is, the stone, Messiah. Hence the benediction begins, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ" (2Co 13:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either at another time, or else at the same time, was added what now Zechariah declares. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zechariah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying.

"In fury Thou walkest through the earth, in wrath Thou stampest down nations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>. Thou goest out to the rescue of Thy people, to the rescue of Thine anointed one; Thou dashest in pieces the head from the house of the wicked one, laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>. Thou piercest with his spears the head of his hordes, which storm hither to beat me to powder, whose rejoicing is, as it were, to swallow the poor in secret. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-15.htm">Habakkuk 3:15</a>. Thou treadest upon the sea: Thy horses, upon the heap of great waters." The Lord, at whose coming in the terrible glory of the majesty of the Judge of the world all nature trembles and appears to fall into its primary chaotic state, marches over the earth, and stamps or tramples down the nations with His feet (compare the kindred figure of the treader of the winepress in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>). Not all nations, however, but only those that are hostile to Him; for He has come forth to save His people and His anointed one. The perfects in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13-15</a> are prophetic, describing the future in spirit as having already occurred. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, referring to the going out of God to fight for His people, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-24.htm">2 Samuel 5:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>, etc. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, rescue, salvation, is construed the second time with an accusative like an inf. constr. (see Ewald, 239, a). The anointed of God is not the chosen, consecrated nation (Schnur., Ros., Hitzig, Ewald, etc.); for the nation of Israel is never called the anointed one (hamma&#770;sh&#305;&#772;a&#774;ch) by virtue of its calling to be "a kingdom of priests" (mamlekheth koha&#774;n&#305;&#772;m, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), neither in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a> nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm">Psalm 89:39</a>. Even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-15.htm">Psalm 105:15</a> it is not the Israelites who are called by God "my anointed" (mesh&#305;&#772;chai), but the patriarchs, as princes consecrated by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-6.htm">Genesis 23:6</a>). And so here also &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;&#1498; is the divinely-appointed king of Israel; not, however, this or that historical king - say Josiah, Jehoiakim, or even Jehoiachin - but the Davidic king absolutely, including the Messiah, in whom the sovereignty of David is raised to an eternal duration, "just as by the Chaldaean king here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a> we must understand the Chaldaean kings generally" (Delitzsch), wince the prophecy spreads from the judgment upon the Chaldaeans to the universal judgment upon the nations, and the Chaldaean is merely introduced as the possessor of the imperial power. The Messiah as the Son of David is distinguished from Jehovah, and as such is the object of divine help, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, where He is called &#1504;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; in this respect, and in the royal Messianic psalms. This help God bestows upon His people and His anointed, by dashing in pieces the head from the house of the wicked one. The ra&#770;sha&#770;&#8219; (wicked one) is the Chaldaean, not the nation, however, which is spoken of for the first time in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>, but the Chaldaean king, as chief of the imperial power which is hostile to the kingdom of God. But, as the following clause clearly shows, the house is the house in the literal sense, so that the "head," as part of the house, is the gable. A distinction is drawn between this and yesho&#772;d, the foundation, and &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, the neck, i.e., the central part looking from the gable downwards. The destruction takes place both from above and below at once, so that the gable and the foundation are dashed in pieces with one blow, and that even to the neck, i.e., up to the point at which the roof or gable rests upon the walls. &#1506;&#1491;, inclusive, embracing the part mentioned as the boundary; not exclusive, so as to leave the walls still rising up as ruins. The description is allegorical, the house representing the Chaldaean dynasty, the royal family including the king, but not "including the exalted Chaldaean kingdom in all its prosperity" (Hitzig). &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, a rare form of the inf. abs., like &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a> (cf. Ewald, 240, b), from &#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, to make bare, to destroy from the very foundation, the infinitive in the sense of the gerund describing the mode of the action.<p>The warlike nation meets with the same fate as the royal house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>). The meaning of the first clause of the verse depends upon the explanation to be given to the word pera&#770;za&#770;v. There is no foundation for the meaning leaders or judges, which has been claimed for the word pera&#770;z&#305;&#772;m ever since the time of Schroeder and Schnur. In Hebrew usage pera&#770;z&#305;&#772; signifies the inhabitant of the plain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>), and pera&#770;zo&#772;th the plains, the open flat land, as distinguished from walled cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>). Pera&#770;zo&#772;n has the same meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>. Consequently Delitzsch derives pera&#770;za&#770;v from a segholate noun perez or pe&#772;rez, in the sense of the population settled upon the open country, the villagers and peasantry, whence the more general signification of a crowd or multitude of people, and here, since the context points to warriors, the meaning hordes, or hostile companies, which agrees with the Targum, Rashi, and Kimchi, who explain the word as signifying warriors or warlike troops. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, the head of his hordes, cannot be the leader, partly because of what follows, "who come storming on," which presupposes that not the leader only, but the hordes or warriors, will be destroyed, and partly also because of the preceding verse, in which the destruction of the king is pronounced, and also because the distinction between the king and the leader of the army is at variance with the complex character of the prophetic description. We must take &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in the literal sense, but collectively, "heads." The prophet was led to the unusual figure of the piercing of the head by the reminiscence of the piercing of Sisera's head by Jael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>). The suffixes in &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493; refer back to &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, sticks, for lance or spears, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>. The meaning of the words is this: with the spear of the king God pierces the heads of his warlike troops; and the thought expressed is, that the hostile troops will slay one another in consequence of the confusion, as was the case in the wars described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23-24</a>, and as, according to prophecy, the last hostile power of the world is to meet with its ruin when it shall attack the kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-21.htm">Ezekiel 38:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-13.htm">Zechariah 14:13</a>). &#1497;&#1505;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1492;&#1507; is to be taken relatively: "which storm hither (sa&#770;&#8219;ar, approach with the swiftness and violence of a storm) to destroy me." The prophet includes himself along with the nation, and uses he&#772;ph&#305;&#772;ts with reference to the figure of the dispersion or powdering of the chaff by a stormy wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-24.htm">Jeremiah 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1514;&#1501; forms a substantive clause by itself: "their rejoicing is," for they who rejoice, as if to swallow, i.e., whose rejoicing is directed to this, to swallow the poor in secret. The enemies are compared to highway murderers, who lurk in dark corners for the defenceless traveller, and look forward with rejoicing for the moment when they may be able to murder him. &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; forms the antithesis to &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. Inasmuch as "the wicked" denotes the Chaldaean; "the poor" is the nation of Israel, i.e., the congregation of the righteous, who are really the people of God. To devour the poor, i.e., to take violent possession of his life and all that he has (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>, and for the fact itself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8-10</a>), is, when applied to a nation, to destroy it (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>).<p>In order that these enemies may be utterly destroyed, God passes through the sea. This thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-15.htm">Habakkuk 3:15</a> connects the conclusion of the description of the judicial coming of God with what precedes. The drapery of the thought rests upon the fact of the destruction of Pharaoh and his horsemen in the Red Sea (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>). The sea, the heap of many waters, is not a figurative expression for the army of the enemy, but is to be taken literally. This is required by &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468; &#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, since &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; with &#1489;, to tread upon a place, or enter into it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-8.htm">Isaiah 59:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24-25</a>), does not suit the figurative interpretation; and it is required still more by the parallel passages, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a> (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1498;), which floated before the prophet's mind, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-11.htm">Zechariah 10:11</a>. Just as God went through the Red Sea in the olden time to lead Israel through, and to destroy the Egyptian army, so will He in the future go through the sea and do the same, when He goes forth to rescue His people out of the power of the Chaldaean. The prophet does not express the latter indeed, but it is implied in what he says. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1498; is an accusative, not instrumenti, however, but of more precise definition: thou, namely, according to thy horses; for "with thy horses," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-19.htm">Psalm 83:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a> (&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498;); cf. Ewald, 281, c, and 293, c. The horses are to be taken, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>, as harnessed to the chariots; and they are mentioned here with reference to the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, which were destroyed by Jehovah in the sea. Cho&#772;mer, in the sense of heap, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-10.htm">Exodus 8:10</a>, is not an accusative, but is still dependent upon the &#1489; of the parallel clause. The expression "heap of many waters" serves simply to fill up the picture, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>. </body></html>
