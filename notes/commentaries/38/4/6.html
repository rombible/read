Thus the angel answers the prophet’s question, “not by descending to an explanation of particulars, but by giving the general purport of the vision; the design being, not to gratify a partial curiosity, but to comfort and encourage an almost desponding people by the assurance that God would, not by those human means, in which they were sufficiently sensible of their own deficiency, but by his own Spirit, render his church triumphant over all opposition.” — Blayney. We may observe further here, that what is done by God’s Spirit, is done by <span class="ital">might </span>and <span class="ital">power; </span>but this stands in opposition to visible force. Israel was brought out of Egypt, and into Canaan, <span class="ital">by might </span>and <span class="ital">power: </span>but they were brought out of Babylon, and into Canaan the second time, by <span class="ital">the Spirit of the Lord of hosts; </span>working upon the spirit of Cyrus, and inclining him to proclaim liberty to them, and upon the spirits of the captives, inclining them to accept the liberty offered them. It was by the Spirit of the Lord that the people were excited and animated to build the temple, and therefore they are said to be helped by the prophets of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-2.htm" title="Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.">Ezra 5:2</a>; because by their mouths the Spirit of God spoke to the people’s hearts. It was by the same Spirit that the heart of Darius was inclined to favour and further that good work, and that the sworn enemies of it were infatuated in their counsels, so that they could not hinder it as they designed. Observe, reader, the work of God is often carried on very successfully, when yet it is carried on very silently, and without the assistance of human force: the gospel temple is built, not by might or power, for <span class="ital">the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, </span>but spiritual; namely, the force of truth and love, which, through the Spirit of the Lord, are mighty to pull down strong holds, and bring men’s hearts and lives <span class="ital">into captivity to the obedience of Christ. </span>Thus the excellency of the power is of God, and not of man.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The prophet's spirit was willing to attend, but the flesh was weak. We should beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us, and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a golden candlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world, and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees were seen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into the bowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposes concerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes he makes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This represented the abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy the ministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured or prevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good work of building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. The difficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficulties shall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will remove mountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains of difficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hard for him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committed to the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel - Osorius: "As if he were to say, the meaning of the vision and scope of what has been exhibited is, 'God's doings have almost cried aloud to Zerubbabel that all these visions shall come to an end in their time, not effected by human might nor in fleshly strength, but in power of the Holy Spirit and through Divine Will.' For the Only Begotten became Man as we are, but He warred not after the flesh, to set up the Church as a candlestick to the world, nor did He, through sensible weapons and armed phalanxes, make those two people His own, or place the spiritual lights on the candlestick; but in the might of His own Spirit He appointed in the Church "first Apostles, then prophets and evangelists" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>, and all the rest of the saintly band, filling them with divine gifts and enriching them abundantly by the influx of His Spirit."<p>Cyril: "Not then in great power nor in fleshly might were the things of Christ, but in power of the Spirit was Satan spoiled, and the ranks of the adverse powers fell with him; and Israel and those who aforetime served the creature rather than the Creator, were called to the knowledge of God through faith. But that He saved all under heaven, not by human arm, but by His own power as God Emmanuel, Hosea too protested, "I will have mercy upon the house of Judah and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle nor by chariots nor by horses nor by horsemen" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-7.htm">Hosea 1:7</a>. But exeeeding fittingly was this said to Zerubbabel, who was of the tribe of Judah and at, that time administered the royal seat at Jerusalem. For that he might not think that, since such glorious successes were foreannounced to him, wars would in their season have to be organized, he lifts him up from these unsound and human thoughts, and bids him be thus minded, that the force was divine, the might of Christ, who should bring such things to pass, and not human."<p>Having given this key of the whole vision, without explaining its details, God enlarges what He had said to Zerubbabel, as He had in the preceding chapter to Joshua Zechariah 3:8-10. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Not by might &#8230; but by my Spirit&#8212;As the lamps burned continually, supplied with oil from a source (the living olive trees) which man did not make, so Zerubbabel need not be disheartened because of his weakness; for as the work is one to be effected by the living Spirit (compare Hag 2:5) of God, man's weakness is no obstacle, for God's might will perfect strength out of weakness (Ho 1:7; 2Co 12:10; Heb 11:34). "Might and power" express human strength of every description, physical, mental, moral. Or, "might" is the strength of many (an "army," literally); "power," that of one man [Pembellus]. God can save, "whether with many, or with them that have no power" (2Ch 14:11; compare 1Sa 14:6). So in the conversion of sinners (1Co 3:6; 2Co 10:4). "Zerubbabel" is addressed as the chief civil authority in directing the work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> so soon as Zechariah had owned his nescience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He; </span> Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel; </span> or, This word of the Lord is to Zerubbabel, it is particularly designed to him, and in an emblem prefigureth what a church, how precious as gold, how full of light; how framed, how maintained it should be by God himself.

Either is encouragement enough, and secureth the future effect, and promiseth a future state of the church, pure and precious as gold, full of knowledge in the doctrines of God, as this candlestick with seven lamps, full of holiness from abundant measures of grace; persevering in it by continued supplies from the Spirit of grace in ordinances, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zechariah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then he answered, and spake unto me, saying,.... In great condescension, in order to instruct him into the true meaning of the vision: <p>This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel; this signifies what was said by the Lord to Zerubbabel, by some one of the prophets sent unto him: <p>saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts: that is, that as the candlestick was supplied with oil, from the two olive trees by the side of it, without the help of any man, to pour in the oil, and trim the lamps; so the temple should be built by Zerubbabel, not through the multitude and strength of men, but through the Spirit of God, animating, exciting, encouraging, and strengthening them to go through the work. The temple was a type of the church, and Zerubbabel a type of Christ; he was so in the high esteem he was had in by the Lord; he was chosen by him; made as a signet, and was precious to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a> in his titles and characters, a servant of the Lord, and governor of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> and in his work, in bringing the Jews out of captivity, and in rebuilding the temple: so Christ is the chosen of God, and exceeding dear and precious to him; is his righteous servant, and Governor of the church, or King of saints; and who has redeemed and delivered his people from the captivity of sin, and Satan, and the law; and is the builder of his church; who has laid the foundation of it, and will bring in the headstone; and which church is built up in all generations through the conversion of sinners; and that is done, not by external force, by carnal weapons, or moral persuasion; but by the sword of the Spirit, the word of God; and not by the power of man's free will, but by the efficacious grace of the divine Spirit: it is indeed done by power and might, but not of the creature: man, whatever power he has to do things natural, civil, outwardly religions, and materially moral, or however in appearance, has no power to do anything spiritually good; not to think a good thought, nor do a good action, in a spiritual manner; much less to work such a work as the work of regeneration, conversion, and sanctification; since he is dead in sin, and can not quicken himself; his understanding is darkened, yea, darkness itself, and he can not command light into it; his will is stubborn and obstinate, and he can not bend it, and subdue it; his heart is hard as a nether millstone, and he cannot soften it, and repent of his sins, in a truly spiritual, gracious, anti-evangelic manner; his affections are inordinate; and he is a lover of sinful pleasures, and not of God, nor of anything divine, to which his carnal mind is enmity; he cannot believe in Christ of himself; faith is not of himself, it is the gift of God, and so is repentance, and every other grace. The work of grace on the soul is expressed by a regeneration, a resurrection from the dead, a creation, and the new man, or a transformation of a man into another man; all which require almighty power to effect: regeneration is not of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God, of Jehovah the Spirit: sanctification is called the sanctification of the Spirit, and every grace of it is a fruit of his; it is he who is the Spirit of life from Christ, that quickens men when dead in trespasses and sins, and enlightens their dark minds with spiritual light, in divine things; it is he that produces evangelical repentance in them, and faith in Christ is of his operation; it is he that begins the work of grace on the heart, and carries it on, and causes to abound in the exercise of every grace, and performs the work of faith with power.

The word is almost synonymous with the following, translated <span class="cmt_word">power</span>; and the two together mean that the effect is to be produced, not by any human means, however potent. Doubtless Zerubbabel was dispirited when he thought how much there was to do, how feeble the means at his disposal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>), and how formidable the opposition; and nothing could better reassure him than the promise of Divine aid. <span class="cmt_word">But by my Spirit.</span> The angel does not say expressly what is to be done; but the purpose that filled the minds of Zechariah and Zerubbabel applied the word. The operations of the Spirit are manifold, and his aid alone could bring these mighty things to pass.

Sun and moon, which give light to day and night, have put themselves, or entered, into their habitation. &#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; with &#1492; local, a dwelling-place, is, according to oriental view, the place from which the stars come out when they rise, and to which they return when they set. Nevertheless it is not actual setting that is spoken of here, but simply their obscuration, which is not the effect of heavy clouds that pour out their water in showers of rain, but is caused by the shining of the arrows of God (&#1500; in &#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1468; denoting the outward cause or occasion). It is not, however, that they "turn pale in consequence of the surpassing brilliancy of the lightnings" (Ewald), but that they "withdraw altogether, from the fear and horror which pervade all nature, and which are expressed in the mountains by trembling, in the waters by roaring, and in the sun and moon by obscuration" (Delitzsch). The idea that this verse refers to the standing still of the sun and moon at the believing word of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>.), in which nearly all the earlier commentators agreed, is quite untenable, inasmuch as &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; cannot mean to stand still in the sky. The arrows and spear (cha&#774;n&#305;&#772;th) of God are not lightnings, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>, etc., because this theophany is not founded upon the idea of a storm, but the darts with which God as a warrior smites down His foes, as the instruments and effects of the wrath of God. A brilliant splendour is attributed to them, because they emanate from Him whose coming, like the sunlight, pours out its rays on both sides (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; has the same meaning here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-3.htm">Nahum 3:3</a> : the flashing, because naked and sharpened, spear. And just as we cannot understand the "bright sword" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-3.htm">Nahum 3:3</a> as signifying flashes of lightning, so here we cannot take the arrows as lightnings. &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; is to be taken relatively, "which pass alone, or shoot by." </body></html>
