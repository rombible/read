The duties required are, not keeping fasts and offering sacrifices, but doing justly and loving mercy, which tend to the public welfare and peace. The law of God lays restraint upon the heart. But they filled their minds with prejudices against the word of God. Nothing is harder than the heart of a presumptuous sinner. See the fatal consequences of this to their fathers. Great sins against the Lord of hosts, bring great wrath from his power, which cannot be resisted. Sin, if regarded in the heart, will certainly spoil the success of prayer. The Lord always hears the cry of the broken-hearted penitent; yet all who die impenitent and unbelieving, will find no remedy or refuge from miseries which while here they despised and defied, but which they then will not be able to bear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I scattered them - Rather, "And I will scatter them." The saying continues what God had said that he had said, and which had come to pass. Among all nations whom they knew not. So God had repeatedly said by Jeremiah, "I will cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, ye nor your fathers; where I will not show you favor" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>; add <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-14.htm">Jeremiah 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a>). This was the aggravation of the original woe in the law: "The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand, a nation of fierce countenance" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-50</a>. There was no mitigation of suffering, when the common bond between man and man, mutual speech, was wanting.<p>That no man passed through nor returned - Literally, "from passer through and from returner;" as in the prophecy of Alexander's march and return, "because of him that passeth by and of him that returneth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-8.htm">Zechariah 9:8</a>; and of Seir God saith, "I will cut off from him, passer-through and returner" . As we say, there shall be no traffic more through her.<p>And they made the pleasant land desolate - They were the doers of what they by their sins caused, by bringing down the judgments of God. Heretofore the land which God had given them, had been in our language "the envy" of all who knew it now they had made it into a desolation, one wide waste <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-3.htm">Jeremiah 50:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-29.htm">Jeremiah 51:29</a>.<p>Dionysius: "What is said in the beginning of the chapter against Jews who abstained indiscreetly, applies mystically to all, not inward, but rude Christians, who not being diligent enough but rather negligent about acts of piety and inward prayer and reformation of the powers of the soul, account highly of bodily exercises and outward observances, and use no slight scrupulosity as to things of less moment, and do not attend to the chief things, charity, humility, patience meekness. On these it must be inculcated, that if they wish their fasts and other outward exercises to please God, they must judge true judgment, and be compassionate, kind, liberal to their neighbors, keep their mind ever steadfast in God, cast away wholly all hardness of heart, and be soft and open to receive within them the word of God. Otherwise their land will be desolate, that is, deprived of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and they scattered amid various vices." Jerome: "That which was formerly a pleasant land, and the hospice of the Trinity, is turned into a desert and dwelling-place of dragons." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. whirlwind&#8212;of wrath (Na 1:3).<p>nations whom they knew not&#8212;foreign and barbarous.<p>desolate after them&#8212;after their expulsion and exile.

"I said, Only do thou fear me, do thou accept correction, so will their dwelling not be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning them: but they most zealously destroyed all their doings. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>. Therefore wait for me, is the saying of Jehovah, for the day when I rise up to the prey; for it is my right to gather nations together, to bring kingdoms in crowds, to heap upon them my fury, all the burning of my wrath: for in the fire of my zeal will the whole earth be devoured." God has not allowed instruction and warning to be wanting, to avert the judgment of destruction from Judah; but the people have been getting worse and worse, so that now He is obliged to make His justice acknowledged on earth by means of judgments. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, not I thought, but I said. This refers to the strenuous exertions of God to bring His justice to the light day by day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a>), and to admonitions of the prophets in order to bring the people to repentance.  &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;  and  &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1495;&#1497;  dna  &#1514;&#1468;  are cohortatives, chosen instead of imperatives, to set forth the demand of God by clothing it in the form of entreating admonition as an emanation of His love. La&#770;qach mu&#772;sa&#770;r as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-2.htm">Zephaniah 3:2</a>. The words are addressed to the inhabitants of Jerusalem personified as the daughter of Zion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-11.htm">Zephaniah 3:11</a>); and &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;, her dwelling, is the city of Jerusalem, not the temple, which is called the dwelling-place of Jehovah indeed, but never the dwelling-place of the nation, or of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The clause which follows, and which has been very differently interpreted, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, can hardly be taken in any other way than that in which Ewald has taken it, viz., by rendering ko&#772;l as the accusative of manner: according to all that I have appointed, or as I have appointed everything concerning them. For it is evidently impracticable to connect it with what precedes as asyndeton, because the idea of &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; cannot be taken per zeugma from &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, and we should necessarily have to supply that idea. For hikka&#770;re&#772;th does not in any way fit in with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, whether we take &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; in the sense of charge, command, appoint (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm">Job 34:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-23.htm">Job 36:23</a>), or in that of correct, punish. For the thought that God will cut off all that He has appointed concerning Jerusalem, would be just as untenable as the thought that He will exterminate the sins that have been punished in Jerusalem. But instead of repenting, the people have only shown themselves still more zealous in evil deeds. Hishk&#305;&#772;m, to rise early, then in connection with another verb, adverbially: early and zealously. Hishch&#305;&#772;th, to act corruptly; and with &#8219;a&#774;l&#305;&#772;lo&#772;th, to complete corrupt and evil deeds (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). Jehovah must therefore interpose with punishment.</body></html>
