The duties required are, not keeping fasts and offering sacrifices, but doing justly and loving mercy, which tend to the public welfare and peace. The law of God lays restraint upon the heart. But they filled their minds with prejudices against the word of God. Nothing is harder than the heart of a presumptuous sinner. See the fatal consequences of this to their fathers. Great sins against the Lord of hosts, bring great wrath from his power, which cannot be resisted. Sin, if regarded in the heart, will certainly spoil the success of prayer. The Lord always hears the cry of the broken-hearted penitent; yet all who die impenitent and unbelieving, will find no remedy or refuge from miseries which while here they despised and defied, but which they then will not be able to bear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And oppress not - He had commanded positive acts of love; he now forbids every sort of unlove. "He that oppresseth the poor," Solomon had said, "reproacheth his Maker. The widow, the orphan, the stranger, the afflicted" <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>, are, throughout the law, the special objects of God's care. This was the condition which God made by Jeremiah; "If ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor; if ye oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt, then will I cause you to dwell in this, place" <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-7</a>. It was on the breach of the covenant to set their brethren free in the year of release, that God said; "I proclaim a liberty for you to the sword, to the pestilence and to the famine, and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-17.htm">Jeremiah 34:17</a>.<p>And let none of you imagine - that is, "devise, as, by Micah, God retorted the evil upon them.

"Woe to the refractory and polluted one, the oppressive city! <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-2.htm">Zephaniah 3:2</a>. She has not hearkened to the voice; not accepted discipline; not trusted in Jehovah; not drawn near to her God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a>. Her princes are roaring lions in the midst of her; her judges evening wolves, who spare not for the morning. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-4.htm">Zephaniah 3:4</a>. Her prophets boasters, men of treacheries: her priests desecrate that which is holy, to violence to the law." The woe applies to the city of Jerusalem. That this is intended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-1.htm">Zephaniah 3:1</a> is indisputably evident from the explanation which follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-2.htm">Zephaniah 3:2-4</a> of the predicates applied to the city addressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-1.htm">Zephaniah 3:1</a>. By the position of the indeterminate predicates &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1504;&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; before the subject to which the ho&#772;i refers, the threat acquires greater emphasis. &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is not formed from the hophal of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, lxx, Cyr., Cocc.), but is the participle kal of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;  equals  &#1502;&#1512;&#1492; or &#1502;&#1512;&#1512;, to straighten one's self, and hold one's self against a person, hence to be rebellious (see Delitzsch on Job, on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-2.htm">Job 33:2</a>, note). &#1504;&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, stained with sins and abominations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>). Yo&#772;na&#770;h does not mean columba, but oppressive (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-38.htm">Jeremiah 25:38</a>)), as a participle of ya&#770;na&#770;h to oppress (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>). These predicates are explained and vindicated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-2.htm">Zephaniah 3:2-4</a>, viz., first of all &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-2.htm">Zephaniah 3:2</a>. She gives no heed to the voice, sc. of God in the law and in the words of the prophets (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>, where &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; occurs in the repetition of the first hemistich). The same thing is affirmed in the second clause, "she accepts no chastisement." These two clauses describe the attitude assumed towards the legal contents of the word of God, the next two the attitude assumed towards its evangelical contents, i.e., the divine promises. Jerusalem has no faith in these, and does not allow them to draw her to her God. The whole city is the same, i.e., the whole of the population of the city. Her civil and spiritual rulers are no better. Their conduct shows that the city is oppressive and polluted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm">Zephaniah 3:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-4.htm">Zephaniah 3:4</a>). Compare with this the description of the leaders in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1-12</a>. The princes are lions, which rush with roaring upon the poor and lowly, to tear them in pieces and destroy them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-2.htm">Ezekiel 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>). The judges resemble evening wolves (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>), as insatiable as wolves, which leave not a single bone till the following morning, of the prey they have caught in the evening. The verb ga&#770;ram is a denom. from gerem, to gnaw a bone, piel to crush them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a>); to gnaw a bone for the morning, is the same as to leave it to be gnawed in the morning. Ga&#770;ram has not in itself the meaning to reserve or lay up (Ges. Lex.). The prophets, i.e., those who carry on their prophesying without a call from God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), are po&#772;cha&#774;z&#305;&#772;m, vainglorious, boasting, from pa&#770;chaz, to boil up or boil over, and when applied to speaking, to overflow with frivolous words. Men of treacheries, bo&#772;gedo&#772;th, a subst. verb, from ba&#770;gad, the classical word for faithless adultery or apostasy from God. The prophets proved themselves to be so by speaking the thoughts of their own hearts to the people as revelations from God, and thereby strengthening it in its apostasy from the Lord. The priests profane that which is holy (qoodesh, every holy thing or act), and do violence to the law, namely, by treating what is holy as profane, and perverting the precepts of the law concerning holy and unholy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>). </body></html>
