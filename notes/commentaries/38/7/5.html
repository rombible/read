Those who would know God's mind should consult God's ministers; and, in doubtful cases, ask advice of those whose special business it is to search the Scriptures. The Jews seemed to question whether they ought to continue their fasts, seeing that the city and temple were likely to be finished. The first answer to their inquiry is a sharp reproof of hypocrisy. These fasts were not acceptable to God, unless observed in a better manner, and to better purpose. There was the form of duty, but no life, or soul, or power in it. Holy exercises are to be done to God, looking to his word as our rule, and his glory as our end, seeking to please him and obtain his favour; but self was the centre of all their actions. And it was not enough to weep on fast days; they should have searched the Scriptures of the prophets, that they might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy with their fathers. Whether people are in prosperity or adversity, they must be called upon to leave their sins, and to do their duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Speak unto all the people of the land - They of Bethel had spoken as one man, as Edom said to Israel, "Thou shalt not pass by me" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>; and "the men of Israel said to the Hivite; Perhaps thou dwellest in the midst of me, and how shall I make a league with thee?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>.

Yet the fasting and mourning had been real, but irreligious, like remorse for ill-deeds, which has self only for its ground. He prepares the way for His answer by correcting the error of the question. Osorius: "Ye fasted to yourselves, not to Me. For ye mourned your sorrows, not your misdeeds; and your public fast was undertaken, not for My glory, but out of feeling for your own grief. But nothing can be pleasing to God, which is not referred to His glory.

Speak unto all&#8212;The question had been asked in the name of the people in general by Sherezer and Regemmelech. The self-imposed fast they were tired of, not having observed it in the spirit of true religion.<p>seventh month&#8212;This fast was in memory of the murder of Gedaliah and those with him at Mizpah, issuing in the dispersion of the Jews (2Ki 25:25, 26; Jer 41:1-3).<p>did ye &#8230; fast unto me?&#8212;No; it was to gratify yourselves in hypocritical will-worship. If it had been "unto Me," ye would have "separated yourselves" not only from food, but from your sins (Isa 58:3-7). They falsely made the fast an end intrinsically meritorious in itself, not a means towards God's glory in their sanctification. The true principle of piety, reference to God, was wanting: hence the emphatic repetition of "unto Me." Before settling questions as to the outward forms of piety (however proper, as in this case), the great question was as to piety itself; that being once settled, all their outward observances become sanctified, being "unto the Lord" (Ro 14:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Speak unto all the people, </span> i.e. either by their messengers who came in their name, or to all the Jews that were at Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the land; </span> by which it seems to be not the loiterers in Babylon, but the returned in Judea, that sent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And to the priests:</span> some of these perhaps doubted; and others might overvalue and dote on these voluntary services, and needed, as well as deserved, a reproof. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When ye fasted and mourned:</span> who prescribed this your fast? and since you needs would, (as it was at liberty you might fast and mourn,) who was better for it? or did you do it to please me, when you displeased me by other, your sinful courses? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the fifth month:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-3.htm" title="And to speak to the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?">Zechariah 7:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And seventh; </span> for the murder of Gedaliah, slain by Ishmael, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.">Jeremiah 41:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Even those seventy years; </span> so many they were since Gedaliah’s death to this time of inquiry, which is made now as many years after the return as Gedaliah was slain after the beginning of the captivity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Did ye at all fast unto me?</span> whatever was in it, there was very little in it from me, no command, no honour; as you ordered it, you pleased yourselves in it, not me; you wept more for the inconveniences of the thing than the sinfulness of it.

This fast was instituted in consequence of the murder of Gedaliah,  <span class="date">B.C. 587</span>, just seventy years ago, when the greater part of the remnant of the Jews, contrary to the prophet's warning, fled into Egypt to escape the punishment of the crime (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-25.htm">2 Kings 25:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2, 16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Did ye at all fast unto me?</span> It was not by God's command, or to do him honor, that they fasted; not from hearty repentance or sorrow for the sins which had brought ruin upon their city and country; but from vexation at the calamity itself, and in a self-righteous spirit, with some idea of gaining merit by this punishment of the body; and God was not constrained by this formal observance to show them favour. <span class="cmt_word">Even to me.</span> (For the forcible repetition of the pronoun, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-34.htm">Genesis 27:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zephaniah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this statement of the aim of the judgments of God, Zephaniah mentions two other powerful heathen nations as examples, to prove that the whole of the heathen world will succumb to the judgment. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-12.htm">Zephaniah 2:12</a>. "Ye Cushites also, slain of my sword are they. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-13.htm">Zephaniah 2:13</a>. And let him stretch out his hand toward the south, and destroy Asshur; and make Nineveh a barren waste, a dry place, like the desert. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>. And herds lie down in the midst of it, all kinds of beasts in crowds: pelicans also and hedgehogs will lodge on their knobs; the voice of the singer in the window; heaps upon the threshold: for their cedar-work hath He made bare. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>. This the city, the exulting one, the safely dwelling one, which said in her heart, I, and no more: how has she become a desolation, a lair of beasts! Every one that passeth by it will hiss, swing his hand." As a representative of the heathen dwelling in the south, Zephaniah does not mention Edom, which bordered upon Judah, or the neighbouring land of Egypt, but the remote Ethiopia, the furthest kingdom or people in the south that was known to the Hebrews. The Ethiopians will be slain of the sword of Jehovah. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; does not take the place of the copula between the subject and predicate, any more than &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-11.htm">Ezra 5:11</a> (to which Hitzig appeals in support of this usage: see Delitzsch, on the other hand, in his Comm. on Isaiah, l.c.), but is a predicate. The prophecy passes suddenly from the form of address (in the second person) adopted in the opening clause, to a statement concerning the Cushites (in the third person). For similar instances of sudden transition, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-18.htm">Zephaniah 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a>.<p>(Note: Calvin correctly says: "The prophet commences by driving them, in the second person, to the tribunal of God, and then adds in the third person, 'They will be,' etc.")<p>&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; is a reminiscence from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a> : slain by Jehovah with the sword. Zephaniah says nothing further concerning this distant nation, which had not come into any hostile collision with Judah in his day; and only mentions it to exemplify the thought that all the heathen will come under the judgment. The fulfilment commenced with the judgment upon Egypt through the Chaldaeans, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-9.htm">Ezekiel 30:9</a>, as compared with Josephus, Ant. x. 11, and continues till the conversion of that people to the Lord, the commencement of which is recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27-38</a>. The prophet dwells longer upon the heathen power of the north, the Assyrian kingdom with its capital Nineveh, because Assyria was then the imperial power, which was seeking to destroy the kingdom of God in Judah. This explains the fact that the prophet expresses the announcement of the destruction of this power in the form of a wish, as the use of the contracted forms ye&#772;t and ya&#770;se&#772;m clearly shows. For it is evident that Ewald is wrong in supposing that &#1493;&#1497;&#1496; stands for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1496;, or should be so pointed, inasmuch as the historical tense, "there He stretched out His hand," would be perfectly out of place. &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491; (to stretch out a hand), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>. &#8219;al tsa&#770;pho&#772;n, over (or against) the north. The reference is to Assyria with the capital Nineveh. It is true that this kingdom was not to the north, but to the north-east, of Judah; but inasmuch as the Assyrian armies invaded Palestine from the north, it is regarded by the prophets as situated in the north. On Nineveh itself, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a> (p. 263); and on the destruction of this city and the fall of the Assyrian empire, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a> (p. 379). Lishma&#770;ma&#770;h is strengthened by the apposition tsiyya&#770;h kammidba&#770;r.<p>Nineveh is not only to become a steppe, in which herds feed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-10.htm">Isaiah 27:10</a>), but a dry, desolate waste, where only desert animals will make their home. Tsiyya&#770;h, the dry, arid land - the barren, sandy desert (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1492;&#1468;, in the midst of the city which has become a desert, there lie flocks, not of sheep and goats (&#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>), but  &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1470;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497; , literally of all the animals of the (or a) nation. The meaning can only be, "all kinds of animals in crowds or in a mass."  &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;  is used here for the mass of animals, just as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a> for the multitude of locusts, and as &#1506;&#1501; is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-35.htm">Proverbs 30:35-36</a> for the ant-people; and the genitive is to be taken as in apposition. Every other explanation is exposed to much greater objections and difficulties. For the form &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>. Pelicans and hedgehogs will make their homes in the remains of the ruined buildings (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>, on which passage Zephaniah rests his description). &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, upon the knobs of the pillars left standing when the palaces were destroyed (kaphto&#772;r; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>). The reference to the pelican, a marsh bird, is not opposed to the tsiyya&#770;h of <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-13.htm">Zephaniah 2:13</a>, since Nineveh stood by the side of streams, the waters of which formed marshes after the destruction of the city. &#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; cannot be rendered "a voice sings," for sho&#772;re&#772;r, to sing, is not used for tuning or resounding; but yesho&#772;re&#772;r is to be taken relatively, and as subordinate to &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, the voice of him that sings will be heard in the window. Jerome gives it correctly: vox canentis in fenestra. There is no necessity to think of the cry of the owl or hawk in particular, but simply of birds generally, which make their singing heard in the windows of the ruins. The sketching of the picture of the destruction passes from the general appearance of the city to the separate ruins, coming down from the lofty knobs of the pillars to the windows, and from these to the thresholds of the ruins of the houses. Upon the thresholds there is cho&#772;rebh, devastation ( equals  rubbish), and no longer a living being. This is perfectly appropriate, so that there is no necessity to give the word an arbitrary interpretation, or to alter the text, so as to get the meaning a raven or a crow. The description closes with the explanatory sentence: "for He has laid bare the cedar-work," i.e., has so destroyed the palaces and state buildings, that the costly panelling of the walls is exposed. 'Arza&#770;h is a collective, from 'erez, the cedar-work, and there is no ground for any such alteration of the text as Ewald and Hitzig suggest, in order to obtain the trivial meaning "hews or hacks in pieces," or the cold expression, "He destroys, lays bare." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a> the picture is rounded off. "This is the city," i.e., this is what happens to the exulting city. &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1492;, exulting, applied to the joyful tumult caused by the men - a favourite word with Isaiah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-7.htm">Isaiah 23:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-8.htm">Isaiah 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13</a>). The following predicates from &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; to &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; are borrowed from the description of Babel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>, and express the security and self-deification of the mighty imperial city. The Yod in 'aphs&#305;&#772; is not paragogical, but a pronoun in the first person; at the same time, 'ephes is not a preposition, "beside me," since in that case the negation "not one" could not be omitted, but "the non-existence," so that &#1488;&#1508;&#1505;&#1497;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, I am absolutely no further (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>). But how has this self-deifying pride been put to shame! &#1488;&#1497;&#1498;, an expression of amazement at the tragical turn in her fate. The city filled with the joyful exulting of human beings has become the lair of wild beasts, and every one that passes by expresses his malicious delight in its ruin. Sha&#770;raq, to hiss, a common manifestation of scorn (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>). &#1492;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506; &#1497;&#1491;, to swing the hand, embodying the thought, "Away with her, she has richly deserved her fate." </body></html>
