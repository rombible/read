It must be observed, however, that though the prediction contained in these verses might, in the primary sense, refer to those times of the Jewish republic which should precede the coming of the Messiah, and to the proselytes, which should then be made to the Jewish religion; yet the expressions are such, that it can scarce be doubted that the times of the gospel are also and more especially intended, when many more, of various nations, should be brought to the knowledge of the true God, and engaged to worship him in an acceptable manner. <span class="ital">There shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities — </span>Great multitudes of different cities and nations. <span class="ital">Saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord — </span>The expressions allude to the Jews going up in companies to Jerusalem at the solemn feasts. <span class="ital">I will go also — </span>So every single person shall express his willingness to go along with them. <span class="ital">Many people, &c., shall come to seek the Lord in Jerusalem — </span>Understanding the words literally, we find the first-fruits of these mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-10.htm" title="Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,...">Acts 2:10-12</a>; but mystically Jerusalem means the church of Christ. <span class="ital">To pray before the Lord — </span>To perform all parts of gospel worship.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/zechariah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:18-23 When God comes towards us in ways of mercy, we must meet him with joy and thankfulness. Therefore be faithful and honest in all your dealings; and let it be a pleasure to you to be so, though thereby you come short of the gains others get dishonestly; and, as much as in you lies, live peaceably with all men. Let the truths of God rule in your heads, and let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Thus the ancient servants of God drew the notice of heathen neighbours, whose prejudices were softened. A great increase to the church shall be made. Hitherto the Jews had been prone to learn the idolatries of other nations: what more unlikely than that they should teach religion to their conquerors, and to all the principal nations of the earth! Yet this is expressly foretold, and it came to pass. Hitherto the prophecy has been wonderfully fulfilled, and no doubt future events will explain it further. It is good to be with those who have God with them; if we take God for our God, we must take his people for our people, and be willing to take our lot with them. But let not any one think that mere zeal, either for Jews or Gentiles, will stand in the place of personal religion. Let us be living epistles of Christ, known and read of all men, so that others may wish to go with us, and to have their portion with us in the realms of bliss.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It shall yet be that - The promises are those which God had already made by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> ff) and Micah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a> ff). Yet where was the show of their fulfillment? The Jews themselves, a handful: the temple unfinished; its completion depending, in human sight, upon the will of their pagan masters, the rival worship at Samaria standing and inviting to coalition. Appearances and experience were against it. God says virtually, that it was, in human sight, contrary to all expectations. But "weakness is aye Heaven's might." Despite of all, of the fewness of those who were returned, their downheartedness, broken condition, hopelessness, though all had hitherto failed, though, or rather because, all human energy and strength were gone, as God had said before, "The Lord shall yet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-13</a> :16 (12 English)) choose Jerusalem," so now, It shall "yet" be "that."<p>Nations and many cities shall come - He describes vividly the eagerness and mutual impulse, with which not only many but mighty nations should throng to the Gospel, and every fresh conversion should win others also, until the great tide should sweep through the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. (Isa 2:3; Mic 4:2).<p>Thus saith the Lord of hosts&#8212;a preface needed to assure the Jews, now disheartened by the perils surrounding them, and by the humble aspect of the temple. "Unlikely as what follows may seem to you, Jehovah of hosts, boundless in resources, saith it, therefore it shall be so." Just before Christ's coming, a feeling grew up among the heathen of the unsatisfactoriness of their systems of religion and philosophy; this disposed them favorably towards the religion of the Jew, so that proselytes embraced the worship of Jehovah from various parts of Asia; these again were predisposed to embrace Christianity when it was preached to them (Ac 2:9-12, 41). But the full accomplishment of the conversion of the Gentiles foretold here is reserved till "Jerusalem" (Zec 8:22) becomes the center of Christianized Jewry (Ro 11:12, 15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/zechariah/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thus saith the Lord of hosts:</span> this solemn attestation, that it is the Lord of hosts who will do that great thing next promised, calls both for our heeding and believing of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It shall yet come to pass; </span> how low soever the state of my church doth appear, and really is, yet a time shall come when it shall be more considerable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">There shall come people; </span> that is, multitudes of people, for they shall be inhabitants of many and great cities, which is added to explain what was more obscure in that one word, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">people.</span> The Gentiles shall be added to the church, and increase her greatly. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/zechariah/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, It shall yet come to pass,....

Perowne thinks that vers. 20, 21 refer to the tribes of Israel; but it seems unnatural to suppose the prophet asserting that it will yet happen that Israelites will seek the Lord, when there is no reason to think that they had not done so in some fashion, or that they would need the previous deliberation mentioned in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Many cities.</span> So the LXX. and Vulgate.

"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Direct your heart upon your ways. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-8.htm">Haggai 1:8</a>. Go up to the mountains and fetch wood and build the house, and I will take pleasure therein and glorify myself, saith Jehovah." Ha&#770;ha&#770;r (the mountain) is not any particular mountain, say the temple mountain (Grotius, Maurer, Ros.), or Lebanon (Cocceius, Ewald, etc.); but the article is used generically, and ha&#770;ha&#770;r is simply the mountain regarded as the locality in which wood chiefly grows (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). Fetching wood for building is an individualizing expression for providing building materials; so that there is no ground for the inference drawn by Hitzig and many of the Rabbins, that the walls of the temple had been left standing when it was destroyed, so that all that had to be done was to renew the wood-work, - an inference at variance not only with the reference made to the laying of the foundation of the temple in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-18.htm">Haggai 2:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>, but also to the express statement in the account sent by the provincial governor to king Darius in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-8.htm">Ezra 5:8</a>, viz., that the house of the great God was built with square stones, and that timber was laid in the walls. &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, so will I take pleasure in it (the house); whereas so long as it lay in ruins, God was displeased with it. &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;, and I will glorify myself, sc. upon the people, by causing my blessing to flow to it again. The keri &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1492; is an unnecessary emendation, inasmuch as, although the voluntative might be used (cf. Ewald, 350, a), it is not required, and has not been employed, both because it is wanting in &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, for the simple reason that the verbs &#1500;&#1492; do not easily admit of this form (Ewald, 228, a), and also because it is not used in other instances, where the same circumstances do not prevail (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a>).<p>(Note: The later Talmudists, indeed, have taken the omission of the &#1492;, which stands for 5 when used as a numeral, as an indication that there were five things wanting in the second temple: (1) the ark of the covenant, with the atoning lid and the cherubim; (2) the sacred fire; (3) the shechinah; (4) the Holy Spirit; (5) the Urim and Thummim (compare the Babylonian tract Joma 21b, and Sal. ben Melech, Miclal Jophi on <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-8.htm">Haggai 1:8</a>).)<p>Ewald and Hitzig adopt this rendering, "that I may feel myself honoured," whilst Maurer and Rckert translate it as a passive, "that I may be honoured." But both of these views are much less in harmony with the context, since what is there spoken of is the fact that God will then turn His good pleasure to the people once more, and along with that His blessing. How thoroughly this thought predominates, is evident from the more elaborate description, which follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-9.htm">Haggai 1:9-11</a>, of the visitation from God, viz., the failure of crops and drought. </body></html>
