Those who believed the promises, were to show their faith by their works, and to wait the fulfilment. When God is displeased, he can cause trade to decay, and set every man against his neighbour; but when he returns in mercy, all is happy and prosperous. Surely believers in Christ must not trifle with the exhortation to put away lying, and to speak every man peace with his neighbour, to hate what the Lord hates, and to love that wherein he delights.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the seed shall be peace - o"Your seed shall be peace and a blessing, so that they will call it 'a seed of peace.'"

So that the words may be paraphrased, <span class="ital">The processes of agriculture shall prosper</span>. Another rendering, however, according to which this clause is in apposition with the words immediately following, <span class="ital">The seed</span> (<span class="ital">or plant</span>) <span class="ital">of peace, namely, the vine, shall give</span>, &c., has been strongly supported. The vine is then thought to be called “the seed of peace,” because “it can only flourish in peaceful times, and not when the land is laid waste by enemies.” But one fails to see how this is a peculiarity of the vine. It would seem to be equally true of corn and other products of the earth. Moreover, such an apposition destroys the <span class="ital">balance</span> of the three following clauses, which form a threefold expansion of the general statement with which the verse begins. In the <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span> it is said, “The vine is pre-eminently <span class="ital">a plant of peace</span>.” But in all the passages referred to in support of the assertion the fig-tree is associated with the vine. It is difficult, therefore, to see how the vine can be singled out as <span class="ital">the</span> plant of peace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to possess</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">to inherit.</span> Comp. <span class="greekheb">ὁ νικῶν κληρονμήσει ταῦτα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-7.htm" title="He that overcomes shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.">Revelation 21:7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seed shall be prosperous;</span> literally, (<span class="accented">there shall be</span>) <span class="accented">the seed of peace.</span> The crops sown shall be crops of peace, safe and secure, in contradistinction to the threat in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>, that the seed should be sown in vain, for it should be devoured by an enemy (Knabenbauer). Or, more generally, all farming labours shall succeed and prosper. Jerome's paraphrase is, "There shall be universal peace and joy;" Septuagint," But I will show forth peace." Another way of understanding the words which has found much favour with modern commentators is to take the clause in apposition with the words immediately following; thus: "The seed (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> growth) of peace, the vine, shall give its fruit." But there is no especial reason why the vine should be called "the seed of peace." It is not peculiar among fruit trees for requiring a time of peace for its cultivation. And the term "seed" is very inappropriate to the vine, which was not raised from seed, but from cuttings and layers. Perowne also points out that such a rendering destroys the balance of the three following clauses, which explain and expand the general statement that agriculture shall prosper. Dr. Alexander takes "the seed of peace" to be that from which peace springs; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that peace should be radically established in the land, and from this fact the results following should ensue. This affords a very good sense; but it is probably a metaphor quite unintended by the prophet. The Syriac reads differently, "The seed shall be safe." <span class="cmt_word">The remnant</span> (see on ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">To possess;</span> <span class="accented">to inherit</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a>). This promise recalls the blessings in the old Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-6.htm">Psalm 67:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zephaniah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I gather together those that mourn for the festive meeting; they are of thee; reproach presses upon them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19</a>. Behold, at that time I will treat with all thine oppressors, and will save the limping, and gather together that which is dispersed, and make them a praise and a name in every land of their shame. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-20.htm">Zephaniah 3:20</a>. At that time will I bring you and gather you in time; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the nations of the earth, when I turn your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah." The salvation held up in prospect before the remnant of Israel, which has been refined by the judgments and delivered, was at a very remote distance in Zephaniah's time. The first thing that awaited the nation was the judgment, through which it was to be dispersed among the heathen, according to the testimony of Moses and all the prophets, and to be refined in the furnace of affliction. The ten tribes were already carried away into exile, and Judah was to share the same fate immediately afterwards. In order, therefore, to offer to the pious a firm consolation of hope in the period of suffering that awaited them, and one on which their faith could rest in the midst of tribulation, Zephaniah mentions in conclusion the gathering together of all who pine in misery at a distance from Zion, and who are scattered far and wide, to assure even these of their future participation in the promised salvation. Every clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-18.htm">Zephaniah 3:18</a> is difficult. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497; is a niphal participle of &#1497;&#1490;&#1492;, with &#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1493;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>, in the sense of to mourn, or be troubled. Mo&#772;&#8219;e&#772;d, the time of the feast, when all Israel gathered together to rejoice before Jehovah, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-10.htm">Hosea 12:10</a>, except that the word is not to be restricted to the feast of tabernacles, but may be understood as relating to all the feasts to which pilgrimages were made. The preposition min is taken by many in the sense of far from; in support of which Hitzig appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>. But that passage is rather opposed to the application of the meaning referred to, inasmuch as we have &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; there, in which min denotes the cause. And this causal signification is to be retained here also, if only because of the close connection between &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497; and &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, according to which the dependent word can only denote the object or occasion of the no&#772;ga&#770;h. Those who are troubled for the festal meeting are they who mourn because they cannot participate in the joy of assembling before the face of the Lord, namely, on account of their banishment into foreign lands. Mimme&#772;kh ha&#770;yu&#772;, from thee were they, i.e., they have been thine (min expressing descent or origin, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-59.htm">Ezra 2:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>; and the whole clause containing the reason for their meeting). The explanation given by Anton and Strauss is unsuitable and forced: "They will be away from thee, namely, separated from thee as mourners." In the last clause it is a matter of dispute to what the suffix in &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; refers. The explanation of Strauss, that it refers to Zion, is precluded by the fact that Zion is itself addressed, both in what precedes and what follows, and the thought does not require so rapid a change of persons. It is more natural to refer it to &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1497;, in which case the singular suffix is used collectively as a neuter, like the feminines &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;; and the meaning takes this form: a burden upon them, viz., those who mourned for the feasts, was the reproach, sc. of slavery among the heathen (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19</a>, at the close). Consequently the clause assigns a still further reason for the promise, that they are to be gathered together.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19</a>, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; with &#1488;&#1514; signifies neither to handle in an evil sense, nor comprimere, conculcare, but to treat or negotiate with a person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-25.htm">Ezekiel 23:25</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>, where &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, according to a later usage of the language, is a preposition, and not a sign of the accusative. The more precise definition of the procedure, or of the kind of negotiation, is evident from the context. The reference is to a punitive procedure, or treating in wrath. &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-14.htm">Psalm 60:14</a>, the heathen nations who had subjugated Israel. What follows is taken almost verbatim from <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6</a>; and the last clause points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>, to tell the people that the Lord will assuredly realize the glorification promised to the people of His possession, and make Israel an object of praise to the whole earth. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, in all lands, where they have suffered shame. Boshta&#770;m is epexegetical of ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, which governs it; this explains the use of the article with the nomen regens (cf. Ewald, 290, d). In order to paint the glory of the future salvation in still more vivid colours before the eyes of the people, the Lord ends by repeating this promise once more, with a slight change in the words. At that time will I lead you. The indefinite &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; might be expounded from the context, by supplying the place to which God will lead them, after such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5</a>. But it is more natural to think of the phrase, to lead out and in, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>, and to take &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; as an abbreviation of &#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; &#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, picturing the pastoral fidelity with which the Lord will guide the redeemed. The following words &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; point to this: compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>, where the gathering of the lambs is added to the feeding of the flock, to give prominence to the faithful care of the shepherds for the weak and helpless. &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497; is the infinitive: my gathering you, sc. will take place. The choice of this form is to be traced, as Hitzig supposes, to the endeavour to secure uniformity in the clauses. A fresh reason is then assigned for the promise, by a further allusion to the glorification appointed for the people of God above all the nations of the earth, coupled with the statement that this will take place at the turning of their captivity, i.e., when God shall abolish the misery of His people, and turn it into salvation ("turn the captivity," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>), and that "before your eyes;" i.e., not that "ye yourselves shall see the salvation, and not merely your children, when they have closed your eyes" (Hitzig) - for such an antithesis would be foreign to the context - but as equivalent to "quite obviously, so that the turn in events stands out before the eye," analogous to "ye will see eye to eye" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30</a>). This will assuredly take place, for Jehovah has spoken it.<p>On the fulfilment of this promise, Theodoret observes that "these things were bestowed upon those who came from Babylon, and have been offered to all men since then." This no doubt indicates certain points of the fulfilment, but the principal fulfilment is generalized too much. For although the promise retains its perfect validity in the case of the Christian church, which is gathered out of both Jews and Gentiles, and will receive its final accomplishment in the completion of the kingdom of heaven founded by Christ on the earth, the allusion to the Gentile Christians falls quite into the background in the picture of salvation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-11.htm">Zephaniah 3:11-20</a>, and the prophet's eye is simply directed towards Israel, and the salvation reserved for the rescued &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;. But inasmuch as Zephaniah not only announces the judgment upon the whole earth, but also predicts the conversion of the heathen nations to Jehovah the living God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-9.htm">Zephaniah 3:9-10</a>), we must not restrict the description of salvation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-11.htm">Zephaniah 3:11-20</a> to the people of Israel who were lineally descended from Abraham, and to the remnant of them; but must also regard the Gentiles converted to the living God through Christ as included among them, and must consequently say that the salvation which the Lord will procure through the judgment for the daughter Zion or the remnant of Israel, commenced with the founding of the Christian church by the apostles for Judah and the whole world, and has been gradually unfolded more and more through the spread of the name of the Lord and His worship among all nations, and will be eventually and fully realized at the second coming of Christ, to the last judgment, and to perfect His kingdom in the establishment of the New Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a> and 22). It is true that both the judgment and the salvation of the remnant of Israel seeking Jehovah and His righteousness commenced even before Christ, with the giving up of Judah, together with all the tribes and kingdoms falling within the horizon of Old Testament prophecy, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar and the imperial rulers who followed him; but so far as the question of the fulfilment of our prophecy is concerned, these events come into consideration merely as preliminary stages of and preparations for the times of decision, which commenced with Christ not only for the Jews, but for all nations. </body></html>
