When God is displeased, he can cause trade to decay, and set every man against his neighbour; but when he returns in mercy, all is happy and prosperous.

Having then those great promises for the time to come, they were to be earnest in whatever meantime God gave them to do. He speaks to them, "as hearing in these days," that is, that fourth year of Darius in which they apparently were, "these words from the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day when the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid, the temple, that it might be built." Haggai was now gone to his rest. His voice had been silent for two years. But his words lived on. The fulfillment of what the prophets had then spoken in God's Name, was a ground, why their hands should be strong, now and thereafter, for every work which God gave or should give them to do. Ribera: "Some things are said to Jerusalem, that is, to the Jews, which belong to them only; some relate to what is common to them and the other members of the Church, that is, these who are called from the Gentiles. Now he speaks to the Jews, but not so as to seem to forget what he had said before. He would say, Ye who hear the words, which in those days when the temple was founded, Haggai and Zechariah spake, be strong and proceed to the work which ye began of fulfilling the will of the Lord in the building of the temple, and in keeping from the sins, in which ye were before entangled. For as, before ye began to build the temple, ye were afflicted with many calamities, but after ye had begun, all things went well with you, as Haggai said, "so, if you cultivate piety and do not depart from God, ye shall enjoy great abundance of spiritual good" <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15-19</a>.

The exhortation is grounded upon a comparison of their condition, before and after the time when they began in earnest to build the house of the Lord. The improvement which had already taken place since that time should encourage them to go on building, cheered by fresh prophecies and promises from the mouth of the same prophets who had urged them to begin the work, and of Him whose messengers of good they were.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-17.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">The people are exhorted to be of good</span> cheer, for <span class="accented">god will henceforth give them his blessing, which, however, was conditional on their obedience.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let your hands be strong</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm">Haggai 2:15-19</a>).

Jehovah has removed thy judgments, cleared away thine enemy; the King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of thee: thou wilt see evil no more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-16.htm">Zephaniah 3:16</a>. In that day will men say to Jerusalem, Fear not, O Zion; let not thy hands drop. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>. Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a hero who helps: He rejoices over thee in delight, He is silent in His love, exults over thee with rejoicing." The daughter Zion, i.e., the reassembled remnant of Israel, is to exult and shout at the fulness of the salvation prepared for it. The fulness is indicated in the heaping up of words for exulting and rejoicing. The greater the exultation, the greater must the object be over which men exult. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, to break out into a cry of joy, is a plural, because the Israel addressed is a plurality. The re-establishment of the covenant of grace assigns the reason for the exultation. God has removed the judgments, and cleared away the enemies, who served as the executors of His judgments. Pinna&#770;h, piel, to put in order (sc., a house), by clearing away what is lying about in disorder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-31.htm">Genesis 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-36.htm">Leviticus 14:36</a>), hence to sweep away or remove. 'Oye&#772;bh: with indefinite generality, every enemy. Now is Jehovah once more in the midst of the daughter Zion as King of Israel, whereas, so long as Israel was given up to the power of the enemy, He had ceased to be its King. Yeho&#772;va&#770;h is in apposition to melekj Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l, which is placed first for the sake of emphasis, and not a predicate. The predicate is merely &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498; (in the midst of thee). The accent lies upon the fact that Jehovah is in the midst of His congregation as King of Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>). Because this is the case, she will no more see, i.e., experience, evil (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-12.htm">Jeremiah 5:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a>, etc.), and need not therefore any longer fear and despair. This is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-16.htm">Zephaniah 3:16</a> : They will say to Jerusalem, Fear not. She will have so little fear, that men will be able to call her the fearless one. &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; is a vocative of address. It is simpler to assume this than to supply &#1500; from the previous clause. The falling of the hands is a sign of despair through alarm and anxiety (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>). This thought is still further explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>. Jehovah, the God of Zion, is within her, and is a hero who helps or saves; He has inward joy in His rescued and blessed people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-19.htm">Isaiah 65:19</a>). &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1489;&#1514;&#1493; appears unsuitable, since we cannot think of it as indicating silence as to sins that may occur (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-21.htm">Psalm 50:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-14.htm">Isaiah 22:14</a>), inasmuch as, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-13.htm">Zephaniah 3:13</a>, the remnant of Israel commits no sin. Ewald and Hitzig would therefore read yacha&#774;d&#305;&#772;sh; and Ewald renders it "he will grow young again," which Hitzig rejects as at variance with the language, because we should then have &#1497;&#1514;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;. He therefore takes yacha&#774;d&#305;&#772;sh as synonymous with &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, he will do a new thing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>). But this rendering cannot be justified by the usage of the language, and does not even yield a thought in harmony with the context. Silence in His love is an expression used to denote love deeply felt, which is absorbed in its object with thoughtfulness and admiration,<p>(Note: "He assumes the person of a mortal man, because, unless He stammers in this manner, He cannot sufficiently show how much He loves us. Thy God will therefore be quiet in His love, i.e., this will be the greatest delight of thy God, this His chief pleasure, when He shall cherish thee. As a man caresses his dearest wife, so will God then quietly repose in thy love." - Calvin.)<p>and forms the correlate to rejoicing with exultation, i.e., to the loud demonstration of one's love. The two clauses contain simply a description, drawn from man's mode of showing love, and transferred to God, to set forth the great satisfaction which the Lord has in His redeemed people, and are merely a poetical filling up of the expression, "He will rejoice over thee with joy." This joy of His love will the Lord extend to all who are troubled and pine in misery. </body></html>
