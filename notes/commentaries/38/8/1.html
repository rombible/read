God will take away her sins, and then no other enemies shall hurt her. Those who profess religion must adorn their profession by godliness and honesty. When become a city of truth and a mountain of holiness, Jerusalem is peaceable and prosperous. Verses 4,5, beautifully describe a state of great outward peace, attended with plenty, temperance, and contentment. The scattered Israelites shall be brought together from all parts. God will never leave nor forsake them in a way of mercy, for this he has promised them; and they shall never leave nor forsake him in a way of duty, as they have promised him. These promises were partly fulfilled in the Jewish church, betwixt the captivity and the time of Christ's coming; and they had fuller accomplishment in the gospel church; but the full import must be as to the future times of the Christian church, or the future restoration of the Jews. With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible; so far are God's thoughts and ways above ours. In the present low state of vital godliness, we can hardly conceive that so complete a change can be made; but a change thus extensive and glorious, can be brought to pass by the almighty power of the new-creating Spirit, in less time than he was pleased to employ in creating the world. Let the hands of all who labour in the cause of the gospel be strong, serving the Lord in true holiness, assured that their labour shall not be in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dionysius: "After the Lord had, in the preceding chapter, manifoldly rebuked the Jewish people, He now comforts it with renewed promises, as a good physician, who after a bitter draught employs sweet and soothing remedies; as that most loving Samaritan poured in wine and oil." The chapter falls into two portions, each marked by the words, The Word of the Lord of hosts came or came unto me, the first <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-1.htm">Zechariah 8:1-17</a> declaring the reversal of the former judgments, and the complete, though conditional, restoration of God's favor; the 2nd Zechariah 8:18-23 containing the answer to the original question as to those fasts, in the declaration of the joy and the spread of the Gospel. The first portion has, again, a sevenfold, the second, a threefold subordinate division; marked by the beginning, "Thus saith the Lord of hosts." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 8<p>Zec 8:1-23.

The persons addressed are kol &#8219;anve&#772; ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, whom the prophet has summoned in the introduction to his exhortation to repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-3.htm">Zephaniah 2:3</a>), to seek the Lord and His righteousness. The Lord calls upon them, to wait for Him. For the nation as such, or those who act corruptly, cannot be addressed, since in that case we should necessarily have to take chakku&#772; l&#305;&#772; as ironical (Hitzig, Maurer); and this would be at variance with the usage of the language, inasmuch as chikka&#770;h layeho&#772;va&#770;h is only used for waiting in a believing attitude of the Lord and His help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-3.htm">Isaiah 64:3</a>). The l&#305;&#772; is still more precisely defined by &#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, for the day of my rising up for prey. &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; does not mean &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  equals  &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; (lxx, Syr.), or for a witness (Hitzig), which does not even yield a suitable thought apart from the alteration in the pointing, unless we "combine with the witness the accuser and judge" (Hitzig), or, to speak more correctly, make the witness into a judge; nor does &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; stand for &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, in perpetuum, as Jerome has interpreted it after Jewish commentators, who referred the words to the coming of the Messiah, "who as they hope will come, and, as they say, will devour the earth with the fire of His zeal when the nations are gathered together, and the fury of the Lord is poured out upon them." For "the rising up of Jehovah for ever" cannot possibly denote the coming of the Messiah, or be understood as referring to the resurrection of Christ, as Cocceius supposes, even if the judgment upon the nations is to be inflicted through the Messiah. &#1500;&#1506;&#1491; means "for prey," that is to say, it is a concise expression for taking prey, though not in the sense suggested by Calvin: "Just as lions seize, tear in pieces, and devour; so will I do with you, because hitherto I have spared you with too much humanity and paternal care." This neither suits the expression chakku&#772; l&#305;&#772;, according to the only meaning of chikka&#770;h that is grammatically established, nor the verses which follow (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-9.htm">Zephaniah 3:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-10.htm">Zephaniah 3:10</a>), according to which the judgment to be inflicted upon the nations by the Lord is not an exterminating but a refining judgment, through which He will turn to the nations pure lips, to call upon His name. The prey for which Jehovah will rise up, can only consist, therefore, in the fact, that through the judgment He obtains from among the nations those who will confess His name, so that the souls from among the nations which desire salvation fall to Him as prey (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-15.htm">Isaiah 52:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>). It is true that, in order to gain this victory, it is necessary to exterminate by means of the judgment the obstinate and hardened sinners. "For my justice (right) is to gather this." Mishpa&#770;t does not mean judicium, judgment, here; still less does it signify decretum, a meaning which it never has; but justice or right, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a>. My justice, i.e., the justice which I shall bring to the light, consists in the fact that I pour my fury upon all nations, to exterminate the wicked by judgments, and to convert the penitent to myself, and prepare for myself worshippers out of all nations. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; is governed by &#1500;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. God will gather together the nations, to sift and convert them by severe judgments. To give the reason for the terrible character and universality of the judgment, the thought is repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a> that "all the earth shall be devoured in the fire of His zeal." In what follows, the aim and fruit of the judgment are given; and this forms an introduction to the announcement of salvation. </body></html>
