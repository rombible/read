Those who believed the promises, were to show their faith by their works, and to wait the fulfilment. When God is displeased, he can cause trade to decay, and set every man against his neighbour; but when he returns in mercy, all is happy and prosperous. Surely believers in Christ must not trifle with the exhortation to put away lying, and to speak every man peace with his neighbour, to hate what the Lord hates, and to love that wherein he delights.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/zechariah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There was no hire for man - Literally, "hire for man came not to pass."

At the rebuilding of the walls, after this time, the Samaritans, "Arabians, Ammonites, Ashdodites conspired to fight against Jerusalem," and to "slay them" <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7-11</a>. They are summed up here in the general title used here, "our adversaries".<p>For I set - Literally, "and I set." Domestic confusions and strife were added to hostility from without. Nehemiah's reformation was, in part, to stop the grinding usury in time of dearth or to lear the king's taxes, through which men sold lands, vineyards, even their children <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1-12</a>.<p>  (literally) let them loose, each against his neighbor - in that He left them to their own ways and did not withhold them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/zechariah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. before these days&#8212;before the time in which ye again proceeded with the building of the temple (Zec 8:9), namely, at the time that the temple lay neglected.<p>no hire for man &#8230; beast&#8212;that is, no produce of the field to repay the labor of man and beast on it (Hag 1:6, 9, 10; 2:16).<p>neither &#8230; peace to him that went out or came in&#8212;(2Ch 15:5).

Jehovah has removed thy judgments, cleared away thine enemy; the King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of thee: thou wilt see evil no more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-16.htm">Zephaniah 3:16</a>. In that day will men say to Jerusalem, Fear not, O Zion; let not thy hands drop. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>. Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a hero who helps: He rejoices over thee in delight, He is silent in His love, exults over thee with rejoicing." The daughter Zion, i.e., the reassembled remnant of Israel, is to exult and shout at the fulness of the salvation prepared for it. The fulness is indicated in the heaping up of words for exulting and rejoicing. The greater the exultation, the greater must the object be over which men exult. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, to break out into a cry of joy, is a plural, because the Israel addressed is a plurality. The re-establishment of the covenant of grace assigns the reason for the exultation. God has removed the judgments, and cleared away the enemies, who served as the executors of His judgments. Pinna&#770;h, piel, to put in order (sc., a house), by clearing away what is lying about in disorder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-31.htm">Genesis 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-36.htm">Leviticus 14:36</a>), hence to sweep away or remove. 'Oye&#772;bh: with indefinite generality, every enemy. Now is Jehovah once more in the midst of the daughter Zion as King of Israel, whereas, so long as Israel was given up to the power of the enemy, He had ceased to be its King. Yeho&#772;va&#770;h is in apposition to melekj Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l, which is placed first for the sake of emphasis, and not a predicate. The predicate is merely &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498; (in the midst of thee). The accent lies upon the fact that Jehovah is in the midst of His congregation as King of Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>). Because this is the case, she will no more see, i.e., experience, evil (&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-12.htm">Jeremiah 5:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-16.htm">Isaiah 44:16</a>, etc.), and need not therefore any longer fear and despair. This is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-16.htm">Zephaniah 3:16</a> : They will say to Jerusalem, Fear not. She will have so little fear, that men will be able to call her the fearless one. &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; is a vocative of address. It is simpler to assume this than to supply &#1500; from the previous clause. The falling of the hands is a sign of despair through alarm and anxiety (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>). This thought is still further explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>. Jehovah, the God of Zion, is within her, and is a hero who helps or saves; He has inward joy in His rescued and blessed people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-19.htm">Isaiah 65:19</a>). &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1489;&#1514;&#1493; appears unsuitable, since we cannot think of it as indicating silence as to sins that may occur (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-21.htm">Psalm 50:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-14.htm">Isaiah 22:14</a>), inasmuch as, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-13.htm">Zephaniah 3:13</a>, the remnant of Israel commits no sin. Ewald and Hitzig would therefore read yacha&#774;d&#305;&#772;sh; and Ewald renders it "he will grow young again," which Hitzig rejects as at variance with the language, because we should then have &#1497;&#1514;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;. He therefore takes yacha&#774;d&#305;&#772;sh as synonymous with &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, he will do a new thing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>). But this rendering cannot be justified by the usage of the language, and does not even yield a thought in harmony with the context. Silence in His love is an expression used to denote love deeply felt, which is absorbed in its object with thoughtfulness and admiration,<p>(Note: "He assumes the person of a mortal man, because, unless He stammers in this manner, He cannot sufficiently show how much He loves us. Thy God will therefore be quiet in His love, i.e., this will be the greatest delight of thy God, this His chief pleasure, when He shall cherish thee. As a man caresses his dearest wife, so will God then quietly repose in thy love." - Calvin.)<p>and forms the correlate to rejoicing with exultation, i.e., to the loud demonstration of one's love. The two clauses contain simply a description, drawn from man's mode of showing love, and transferred to God, to set forth the great satisfaction which the Lord has in His redeemed people, and are merely a poetical filling up of the expression, "He will rejoice over thee with joy." This joy of His love will the Lord extend to all who are troubled and pine in misery. </body></html>
