His Strength and Wealth.<p>14. Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen&#8212;His passion for horses was greater than that of any Israelitish monarch before or after him. His stud comprised fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses. This was a prohibited indulgence, whether as an instrument of luxury or power. But it was not merely for his own use that he imported the horses of Egypt. The immense equestrian establishment he erected was not for show merely, but also for profit. The Egyptian breed of horses was highly valued; and being as fine as the Arabian, but larger and more powerful, they were well fitted for being yoked in chariots. These were light but compact and solid vehicles, without springs. From the price stated (2Ch 1:17) as given for a chariot and a horse, it appears that the chariot cost four times the value of a horse. A horse brought a 150 shekels, which, estimating the shekels at 2s. 3d. or 2s. 6d., amount to &pound;17 2s. or &pound;18 15s., while a chariot brought 600 shekels, equal to &pound;68 9s. or &pound;75; and as an Egyptian chariot was usually drawn by two horses, a chariot and pair would cost &pound;112 sterling. As the Syrians, who were fond of the Egyptian breed of horses, could import them into their own country only through Judea, Solomon early perceived the commercial advantages to be derived from this trade, and established a monopoly. His factors or agents purchased them in the markets or fairs of Egypt and brought them to the "chariot cities," the depots and stables he had erected on the frontiers of his kingdom, such as Bethmarcaboth, "the house of chariots," and Hazarsusah, "the village of horses" (Jos 19:5; 1Ki 10:28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Of this and the three following verses, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm" title="And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.">1 Kings 10:26</a>"</span>, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon,....

And we obtain just a glimpse of the range of thought and purpose present to the mind of the reigning king. The largo expenditure of money would infer without fail the show of brilliant prosperity in the grand city for the time. Whether this would last, and whether it would not infer oppressive taxation somewhere or other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15, 21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>) among the people, time would show. Had this expenditure been all to record, none could suppose the commencing of the practical part of the king's reign either sound or auspicious. But, of course, it is to be qualified by other things that were transpiring, with which the parallel acquaints us (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>), only in different order. We now, however, begin a rapid and self-contained sketch of the reign of Solomon to his very death (ch. 9.) - the sketch one of marked characteristics, and in consistent keeping with the presumable objects of this work. For it is very much monopolized by the account of the temple. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - The contents of this and the following three verses are identical with the parrallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>, except that the words, "and gold," of our ver. 15 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>) are not found there. The position of these four verses in the parallel, towards the close of the account of Solomon, would seem more natural than their position here, which has somewhat the appearance of a fragment interpolated, as on the other hand the account of the harlot-mothers there. <span class="cmt_word">Solomon gathered chariots and</span> <span class="cmt_word">horsemen.</span> The chariot was no institution of Israel (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>), neither of their earliest ancestors, nor of those more proximate. The earliest occasions of the mention of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-9.htm">Genesis 50:9</a>) are in connection with Egypt, and almost all subsequent occasions for a long stretch of time show it in connection with some foreign nation, till we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>) of David "reserving horses" unhoughed "for a hundred chariots," apparently also "reserved" out of the very much larger number which he had taken in battle from Hadadezer King of Zobah. The very genius of the character of God's people, a <span class="accented">pilgrim</span>-genius, as well as their long-time pilgrim<span class="accented">-life</span>, quite accounts for the "chariot," though it be a war-chariot, having never ranked among their treasures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>). Now, however, Solomon thinks it the time to make it a feature of the nation's power and splendour. He gives the large order for fourteen hundred chariots apparently to Egypt (ver. 17; also ch. 9:28), the appropriate number of horses to which would be probably four thousand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>, where note the corrupt numeral forty thousand, 10:26). Solomon's fourteen hundred chariots were probably intended to exceed the numbers of the Egyptian king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-6.htm">2 Chronicles 14:6</a>), of Hadadezer's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>), and of the Syrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>). But, on the other hand, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>, unless, as seems very probable, the numerals in these places are again incorrect. Dr. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible' contains an interesting article on the chariot (vol. 1:295). For significant allusions to the <span class="accented">horsemen</span>, reference may be made to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-20.htm">1 Kings 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a><span class="cmt_word">. Twelve thousand horsemen</span>. These probably purport what we should call <span class="accented">horse-soldiers</span>, or cavalry. And. it is likely that they come to designate these in virtue of the Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) meaning horses of the cavalry sort (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub</span> <span class="accented">voce</span>). The chariot cities. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-5.htm">2 Chronicles 8:5, 6</a> we are expressly told that Solomon "built" purposely these cities, for the chariots and for the horsemen, just as he built the "store" cities (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-17.htm">1 Kings 9:17-19</a>; Xenoph., 'Anab.,' 1:4. &sect; 10). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The theophany, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-15</a>. In that night, i.e., on the night succeeding the day of the sacrifice. The appearance of God by night points to a dream, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-15</a> we are expressly informed that He appeared in a vision.
