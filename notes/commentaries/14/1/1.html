Authority and interest are well bestowed on those that will thus use them for the glory of God, and the promotion of religion. But it is the duty of all men to engage all they have any influence upon in the solemnities of religion, and very desirable to have many to join with them therein: the more the better: it makes these solemnities the more like heaven.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way.

In this story some things are told in more detail than in the books of the kings and therefore help greatly in the understanding of the prophets. Three things are chiefly to be considered here: First, that when the godly kings saw the plagues of God prepared against their country for sin, they turned to the Lord and by earnest prayer were heard, and the plagues removed. Secondly, while the good rulers always loved the prophets of God and were zealous to set forth his religion throughout their dominions, it offended God greatly that the wicked hated his ministers, deposed them and set up idolatry and attempted served God according to the fantasy of men. Thus we have the chief acts from the beginning of the world to the rebuilding of Jerusalem in the 32nd year of Darius, in total 3568 years and six months.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/1-1.htm" title="And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly....">2 Chronicles 1:1-6</a> (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1 Kings 3:4</a>).

But the verb in its present form (hithp. conjugation) is found in Chronicles, omitting other books, just fifteen times, and rarely, if ever, to the level of the mere passive voice. It carries rather the idea of a person who exerts himself, and does all that in him lies <span class="accented">to nerve himself</span> with strength for any object (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-13.htm">1 Chronicles 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7, 8, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-8.htm">2 Chronicles 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-1.htm">2 Chronicles 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-11.htm">2 Chronicles 25:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-6.htm">2 Chronicles 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>).

The parallels of this very simple and natural expression are too numerous for quotation. Some of the earliest are found in well-known connections in the Book of Genesis, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Genesis 21:22; 26:28; 28:15, 20; 31:3.

The beautiful New Testament equivalent occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>, and elsewhere. Like some other of those earliest concisest religious expressions, brevity and simplicity are fully charged with suggestion. And the above quotations will be found to furnish examples of the manifold practical use of the Lord's <span class="accented">presence</span> with any one. That presence may infer the help just of companionship, or of sure sympathy, or of needed counsel, or of strength in the hour of temptation, or of absolute practical help, or of the highest revealings of faith. The whole circle of need, of human and Christian need, the Divine presence "will supply" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The "need" of Solomon in his present position was patent and pressing. Would that he had always kept by the true supply of it! <span class="cmt_word">Magnified him exceedingly</span>.
