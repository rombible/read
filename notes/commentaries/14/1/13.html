Perhaps “to (or <span class= "ital">at</span>) the high place that was at G-ibeon,” was originally a marginal gloss upon this expression. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2Chronicles 1:3</a>.) The reading, “And Solomon came to Jerusalem from before the tent of tryst,” would be quite intelligible without this addition.<p><span class= "bld">And reigned over Israel.</span>—Syr., <span class= "ital">over all Israel.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-1.htm" title="So king Solomon was king over all Israel.">1Kings 4:1</a>.) But the remark, “and he reigned over Israel,” is by no means “superfluous” (Bertheau), inasmuch as it naturally introduces the following sketch of the reign, which carries us on from God’s promise to its fulfilment.<p>The chronicler does not notice the sacrifices which, on his return, Solomon offered before the ark at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-15.htm" title="And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.">1Kings 3:15</a>), nor the story of the king’s wise judgment which there follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/3-16.htm" title="Then came there two women, that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him.">1Kings 3:16-28</a>). It is unreasonable to seek any other ground of such omissions than the free and legitimate exercise of the compiler’s discretion in the choice of his own materials. That he did not depreciate the sanctuary on Mount Zion as a place of sacrifice, is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-18.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.">1Chronicles 21:18</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.">1Chronicles 22:1</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth. - SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar. Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then be contented, without those great things which men generally covet, but which commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From his journey - These words are not in the original text, which is thought to be corrupt.

It is found above thirty times in Exodus, and fully as often in Leviticus and Numbers. Afterwards it is sprinkled more rarely in the historical books. The reason of its being styled "the tabernacle of the <span class="accented">congregation"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>) is doubtful - perhaps because of the gatherings of the people in front of it, or possibly because of its being the place where God would meet with Moses. The other name, the tabernacle of "witness" or "testimony" or covenant" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>, etc.), is not unfrequent.
