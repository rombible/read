Then Solomon spake unto all Israel&#8212;The heads, or leading officers, who are afterwards specified, were summoned to attend their sovereign in a solemn religious procession. The date of this occurrence was the second year of Solomon's reign, and the high place at Gibeon was chosen for the performance of the sacred rites, because the tabernacle and all the ancient furniture connected with the national worship were deposited there. Zadok was the officiating high priest (1Ch 16:39). It is true that the ark had been removed and placed in a new tent which David had made for it at Jerusalem [2Ch 1:4]. But the brazen altar, "before the tabernacle of the Lord," on which the burnt offerings were appointed by the law to be made, was at Gibeon. And although David had been led by extraordinary events and tokens of the divine presence to sacrifice on the threshing-floor of Araunah, Solomon considered it his duty to present his offerings on the legally appointed spot "before the tabernacle," and on the time-honored altar prepared by the skill of Bezaleel in the wilderness (Ex 38:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To the high place; </span> upon which the tabernacle was placed; whence it is called <span class="ital">the great high place</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1 Kings 3:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon,....

It may readily be allowed that even nature and instinct would suggest a certain fitness in selecting <span class="accented">high</span> places, and the impressive grandeur of groves, for the worship of the High and Lofty One and for the offerings of sacrifice to him. It was not otherwise historically (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>). However<span class="accented">, first</span>, it was part of the education of a nation (situated in the heart of the young world) in the unity of the one God, that its worship should be offered in one place, and the smoke of its sacrifices ascend from <span class="accented">one</span> altar; and <span class="accented">secondly</span>, it was not difficult to foresee that the very force that lay in the associations, which dictated the choice of some places (not least, certainly, "the grove"), would constitute their weakness and snare. The prohibitions, therefore, of the Mosaic Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26</a>), witnessed to by such corroborations as are found in commands to obliterate certain Canaanitish traces, that looked long time a different way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-29.htm">Joshua 22:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-23.htm">1 Kings 20:23</a>), approve themselves as in thorough harmony with what all would feel to be the genius of the religious education of Israel, and, through Israel, of the nations of the world. The wonder that impresses us is rather that means were not found to abide by the "letter" of the Law to a far greater degree during all the generations that elapsed before the people were settled in their land, and were gathered in their temple so typical. Is it not possible to regard this as an impressive instance of how, even in a system that sought to be of the closest and most exclusive, the "<span class="accented">spirit</span>," by force of circumstances, resented the tyrannous bondage of the "letter"? Anyway, for ages from the time of that prohibition, the nation had the moral principle as their guide rather than any possibility of keeping safe within a commandment's "letter" (so see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>). Even now, accordingly, the prohibited is still the observed, and by Solomon, too, in the steps of David, even if it be necessary to describe it as the "winked at." And to the "high place" at Gibeon Solomon and all the representatives, <span class="accented">the congregation</span> of Israel, have to repair in order to do sacrifice. The tabernacle was now at Gibeon, whither it had come from Nob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1, 6</a>; from which latter reference, speaking of the "shew-bread," it comes that we know the tabernacle to have resided at Nob awhile; for the circumstance is not positively narrated in any passage of the history (but see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9, 11</a>). <span class="accented">Gibeon</span> was one of the four Hivite cities, the other three being Beeroth, Chephirah, and Kirjath-jearim. It had its first fame from its "wiliness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 4</a>, etc.). By the directest road, it was five miles distant from Jerusalem, in the direction of the sea. It was further noted for the encounter between Joab and Abner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). Again, for the slaying of Amasa by Joab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-6.htm">2 Samuel 20:6-10</a>), and for the death of Joab himself at the hand of Benalak, at the very horns of the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-34</a>). Although the exact date of the lodging of the tabernacle at Gibeon is not told us, nor even the person who was answerable for briging it there, yet there can be no reasonable doubt that it was David, as we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>) of his appointing the priests to offer "the daily sacrifices" there, on the brazen altar of Moses, when Zadok was at their head, and Heman and Jeduthun were their resident musicians. In what particular part of Gibeon or of its immediate neighbourhood the tabernacle was stationed cannot be said with any certainty. Amid a considerable choice of likely places, one forming part of Gibeon itself, and just south of <span class="accented">El-Tib</span>, seems the likeliest, and to be preferred to the suggestion of Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 216), of <span class="accented">Neby-Samuil</span>, which is a mile distant. The present imposing occasion is the last of any importance on which Gibeon is brought before us (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There was the tabernacle</span>. The removal of the tabernacle to Gibeon no doubt followed immediately on the destruction of Nob by Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>, compared with 37; 21:28, 29). <span class="cmt_word">Moses... made in the wilderness</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 26, 27, 33:7-10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_chronicles/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), referring to the fact that David had been for a time king only over Judah, but had been recognised at a later time by all the tribes of Israel as king.
