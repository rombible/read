Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to be disappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that make this world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed in this also; but those that make the other world their end, shall not only obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as much of this world as is good for them, in their way.

In general, the mode of expression is briefer than in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-11.htm">1 Kings 3:11-13</a>, and the conditional promise, "long life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>), is omitted, because Solomon did not fulfil the condition, and the promise was not fulfilled. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a> &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is unintelligible, and has probably come into our text only by a backward glance at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, instead of &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, which the contents demand, and as the lxx and Vulgate have rightly translated it. The addition, "from before the tabernacle," which seems superfluous after the preceding "from the Bamah at Gibeon," is inserted in order again to point to the place of sacrifice at Gibeon, and to the legal validity of the sacrifices offered there (Berth.). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-15.htm">1 Kings 3:15</a>, Solomon, on his return to Jerusalem, offered before the ark still other burnt-offerings and thank-offerings, and prepared a meal for his servants. This is omitted by the author of the Chronicle, because these sacrifices had no ultimate import for Solomon's reign, and not, as Then, supposes, because in his view only the sacrifices offered on the ancient brazen altar of burnt-offering belonging to the temple had legal validity. For he narrates at length in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-18.htm">1 Chronicles 21:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>. how God Himself directed David to sacrifice in Jerusalem, and how the sacrifice offered there was graciously accepted by fire from heaven, and the threshing-floor of Araunah thereby consecrated as a place of sacrifice; and it is only with the purpose of explaining to his readers why Solomon offered the solemn burnt-offering in Gibeon, and not, as we should have expected from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a>, in Jerusalem, that he is so circumstantial in his statements as to the tabernacle. The last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a>, "and he was king over Israel," does not belong to the section treating of the sacrifice at Gibeon, but corresponds to the remark in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-1.htm">1 Kings 4:1</a>, and forms the transition to what follows. </body></html>
