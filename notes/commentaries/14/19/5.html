And if we have been kept through more than common dangers, we are, in a special manner, bound to be thankful. Distinguishing mercies lay us under strong obligations. The prophet tells Jehoshaphat he had done very ill in joining Ahab. He took the reproof well. See the effect the reproof had upon him. He strictly searched his own kingdom. By what the prophet said, Jehoshaphat perceived that his former attempts for reformation were well-pleasing to God; therefore he did what was then left undone. It is good when commendations quicken us to our duty. There are diversities of gifts and operations, but all from the same Spirit, and for the public good; and as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same. Blessed be God for magistrates and ministers, scribes and statesmen, men of books, and men of business. Observe the charge the king gave. They must do all in the fear of the Lord, with a perfect, upright heart. And they must make it their constant care to prevent sin, as an offence to God, and what would bring wrath on the people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What exact change Jehoshaphat made in the judicial system of Judah <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a>, it is impossible to determine. Probably he found corruption widely spread <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-7.htm">2 Chronicles 19:7</a>, and the magistrates in some places tainted with the prevailing idolatry. He therefore made a fresh appointment of judges throughout the whole country; concentrating judicial authority in the hands of a few, or creating superior courts in the chief towns ("fenced cities"), with a right of appeal to such courts from the village judge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 19:5-7.

In later days when Israel was settled in Canaan the “elders of the cities” and the “elders of the priests” exercised the same functions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jehoshaphat’s measures were twofold, (1) to establish judges throughout the cities of Judah, (2) to establish (in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm" title="If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;">Deuteronomy 17:8</a> ff.) a kind of court of appeal in Jerusalem itself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the first measure no doubt the work consisted in removing evil judges and confirming the good in their office, rather than in appointing judges for the first time. The second measure, however, was probably altogether new; David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.">2 Samuel 14:4</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-3.htm" title="And Absalom said to him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you.">2 Samuel 15:3</a>) and Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm" title="Then came there two women, that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him.">1 Kings 3:16</a>) had kept judgment in their own hands. The prominent position assigned to the priests as judges is in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-9.htm" title="And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment:">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm" title="Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judges...  fenced cities</span>. Jehoshaphat proceeds from direct religious reforms to that which is of importance only second in the life of a nation - reform in the matter of civil administration of justice. The skeleton here given of what should be the character of a <span class="accented">judge</span>, and why, harmonizes well with the uniform stress laid in Scripture upon "justice and judgment." It is hard indeed to see, rather impossible, upon what foundation a sure structure of civil growth and stability can be laid, except on that of positive religion. Note the positions and the succinct arguments of vers. 6, 7; and how unequivocally they are based upon faith in a personal God, and upon his revealed character. It can scarcely be that this was the first time of judges being set in the cities of Judah but possibly the meaning intended to be conveyed with emphasis is, that now, looking well round his kingdom, he took care that all the cities should be properly provided with the necessary judges, while of late some had been, and some had not, and some, though they had been officered with judges, had found them not what judges ought to be. The immense majority of the "six thousand" Levite "officers and judges" of David's regulation (1 Chronicles 23:4; 36:29) had, with their superiors, kings and prophets, gone astray. With our present passage may be compared <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where the original enactment of judges and officers is narrated. <span class="accented">Fenced cities</span>. Hebrew for "fenced," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>; kal passive part. plur. The word occurs twenty-six times from the Book of Numbers to the Book of the Prophet Zechariah, and is rendered in the Authorized Version "fenced" or "defenced" twenty-two times, "walled" twice, "strong" once, and "mighty" once. The "gates" of the original institution in Deuteronomy are now (probably still the gates of) <span class="accented">fenced cities.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The campaign undertaken along with Ahab against the Syrians at Ramoth in Gilead, with its origin, course, and results for Ahab, is narrated in 1 Kings in the history of Ahab) in agreement with our narrative, only the introduction to the war being different here. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-1.htm">1 Kings 22:1-3</a> it is remarked, in connection with the preceding wars of Ahab with the Syrians, that after there had been no war for three years between Aram and Israel, in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah came up to the king of Israel; and the latter, when he and his servants had determined to snatch away from the Syrians the city Ramoth in Gilead, which belonged to Israel, called upon Jehoshaphat to march with him to the war against Ramoth. In the Chronicle the more exact statement, "in the third year," which is intelligible only in connection with the earlier history of Ahab, is exchanged for the indefinite &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1511;&#1509;, "at the end of years;" and mention is made of the festal entertainment which Ahab bestowed upon his guest and his train (&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;), to show the pains which Ahab took to induce King Jehoshaphat to take part in the proposed campaign. He killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; ,ecnadn, and enticed, seduced him to go up with him to Ramoth. &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;, to incite, entice to anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-14.htm">Judges 1:14</a>), frequently to evil; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-7.htm">Deuteronomy 13:7</a>, etc. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, to advance upon a land or a city in a warlike sense. The account which follows of the preparations for the campaign by inquiring of prophets, and of the war itself, vv. 4-34, is in almost verbal agreement with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5-35</a>. Referring to 1 Kings or the commentary on the substance of the narrative, we will here only group together briefly the divergences. Instead of 400 men who were prophets, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-5.htm">2 Chronicles 18:5</a>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5</a> we have about 400 men. It is a statement in round numbers, founded not upon exact enumeration, but upon an approximate estimate. Instead of &#1488;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1501;...&#1492;&#1504;&#1500;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-5.htm">2 Chronicles 18:5</a>, in Kings, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>, we have &#1488;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1501;...&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1498;, both verbs being in the same number; and so too in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-14.htm">2 Chronicles 18:14</a>, where in Kings. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-15.htm">1 Kings 22:15</a>, both verbs stand in the plural, notwithstanding that the answer which follows, &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, is addressed to Ahab alone, not to both the kings, while in the Chronicle the answer is given in the plural to both the kings, &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-7.htm">2 Chronicles 18:7</a>, "he prophesies me nothing good, but all his days (i.e., so long as he has been a prophet) evil," the meaning is intensified by the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, which is not found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-9.htm">2 Chronicles 18:9</a>, the &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, which is introduced before the &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1503;, "and sitting upon the threshing-floor," is due to difference of style, for it is quite superfluous for the signification. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-15.htm">2 Chronicles 18:15</a>, the ambiguous words of Micah,' and Jahve will give into the hand of the king" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-15.htm">1 Kings 22:15</a>), are given in a more definite form: "and they (the enemy) shall be given into your hand." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-19.htm">2 Chronicles 18:19</a>, in the first &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492;, the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; after the preceding &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is not only superfluous, but improper, and has probably come into the text by a copyist's error. We should therefore read only &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1494;&#1492;, corresponding to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1494;&#1492; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20</a> : "Then spake one after this manner, and the other spake after another manner." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-23.htm">2 Chronicles 18:23</a>, the indefinite &#1488;&#1497;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>, is elucidated by &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1494;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;, "is that the manner" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-12.htm">1 Kings 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>)., and the verb. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; follows without the relative pronoun, as in the passages cited. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-30.htm">2 Chronicles 18:30</a>, only &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; of the king are mentioned, without any statement of the number, which is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>, with a backward reference to the former war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-24.htm">1 Kings 20:24</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31</a>, after the words, "and Jehoshaphat cried out," the higher cause of Jehoshaphat's rescue is pointed out in the words, "and Jahve helped him, and God drove them from him," which are not found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-32.htm">1 Kings 22:32</a>; but by this religious reflection the actual course of the event is in no way altered. Bertheau's remark, therefore, that "the words disturb the clear connection of the events," is quite unwarrantable. Finally, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-34.htm">2 Chronicles 18:34</a>, &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, he was holding his position, i.e., he held himself standing upright, the Hiph. is more expressive than the Hoph. &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>), since it expresses more definitely the fact that he held himself upright by his own strength. With Ahab's death, which took place in the evening at the time of the going down of the sun, the author of the Chronicle concludes his account of this war, and proceeds in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-1.htm">2 Chronicles 19:1-11</a> to narrate the further course of Jehoshaphat's reign. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-36.htm">1 Kings 22:36-39</a>, the return of the defeated army, and the details as to Ahab's death and burial, are recorded; but these did not fit into the plan of the Chronicle. </body></html>
