Such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel, left the inheritance of their fathers, and went to Jerusalem, that they might have free access to the altar of God, and be out of the temptation to worship the calves. That is best for us, which is best for our souls; in all our choices, religious advantages must be sought before all outward conveniences. Where God's faithful priests are, his faithful people should be. And when it has been proved that we are willing to renounce our worldly interests, so far as we are called to do so for the sake of Christ and his gospel, we have good evidence that we are truly his disciples. And it is the interest of a nation to protect religion and religious people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is probably an extract from the "genealogies" of Iddo <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>.<p>As Jerimoth is not mentioned among the legitimate sons of David <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1-8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4-7</a>, he must have been the child of a concubine.<p>Abihail was probably the "grand-daughter," not "daughter," of Eliab <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 11:18-23.

For - this was the motive of their migration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-14.htm">2 Chronicles 11:14</a> -the Levites (in the wider signification of the word, including the priests) forsook their territory and their possessions, i.e., the cities assigned to them, with the pasture lands for their cattle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>), scil. in the domain of the ten tribes; "for Jeroboam and his sons had driven them out from the priesthood of Jahve." To prevent his subjects from visiting the temple at Jerusalem, which he feared might ultimately cause the people to return to the house of David, Jeroboam had erected his own places of worship for his kingdom in Bethel and Dan, where Jahve was worshipped in the ox images (the golden calves), and had appointed, not the Levites, but men from the body of the people, to be priests in these so-called sanctuaries (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-31</a>), consecrated by himself. By these innovations not only the priests and Levites, who would not recognise this unlawful image-worship, were compelled to migrate to Judah and Jerusalem, but also the pious worshippers of the Lord, who would not renounce the temple worship which had been consecrated by God Himself. All Jeroboam's successors held firmly by this calf-worship introduced by him, and consequently the driving out of the priests and Levites is here said to have been the act of Jeroboam and his sons. By his sons are meant Jeroboam's successors on the throne, without respect to the fact that of Jeroboam's own sons only Nadab reached the throne, and that his dynasty terminated with him; for in this matter all the kings of Israel walked in the footsteps of Jeroboam.</body></html>
