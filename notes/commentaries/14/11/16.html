All such left the inheritances of their fathers, and went and took houses in or near Jerusalem, that they might have free access to the altar and temple of God, and be out of the way of the temptation to worship the calves. Thus the best of the Israelites united themselves to the tribe of Judah, and would have great influence in preserving that tribe from the idolatry into which the ten tribes were fallen. “That is best for us,” says Henry, “which is best for our souls; and in all our choices, advantages for religion must take place of all outward conveniences. Where God’s faithful priests are, his faithful people should be. If Jeroboam cast off God’s ministers, every true-born Israelite will think himself obliged to own them, and stand by them.” Reader, when the ark removes, do you remove and go after it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:13-23 When the priests and Levites came to Jerusalem, the devout, pious Israelites followed them. Such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel, left the inheritance of their fathers, and went to Jerusalem, that they might have free access to the altar of God, and be out of the temptation to worship the calves. That is best for us, which is best for our souls; in all our choices, religious advantages must be sought before all outward conveniences. Where God's faithful priests are, his faithful people should be. And when it has been proved that we are willing to renounce our worldly interests, so far as we are called to do so for the sake of Christ and his gospel, we have good evidence that we are truly his disciples. And it is the interest of a nation to protect religion and religious people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The high places - i. e., the two sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel.<p>For the devils - literally, "for the goats:" probably the word is used (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>) for objects of idolatrous worship generally. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. he ordained him priests&#8212;The persons he appointed to the priesthood were low and worthless creatures (1Ki 12:31; 13:33); any were consecrated who brought a bullock and seven rams (2Ch 13:9; Ex 29:37).<p>for the high places&#8212;Those favorite places of religious worship were encouraged throughout the country.<p>for the devils&#8212;a term sometimes used for idols in general (Le 17:7).

To the north of that again lay Ajalon, now the village Jlo, on the verge of the plain Merj ibn Omeir, four leagues to the west of Gibeon; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a>. Finally, Hebron, the ancient city of the patriarchs, now called el Khalil (The friend of God, i.e., Abraham); see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>. All these fenced cities lay in the tribal domain of Judah, with the exception of Zorah and Ajalon, which were assigned to the tribe of Dan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>.). These two were probably afterwards, in the time of the judges, when a part of the Danites emigrated from Zorah and Eshtaol to the north of Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), taken possession of by Benjamites, and were afterwards reckoned to the land of Benjamin, and are here named as cities which Rehoboam fortified in Benjamin. If we glance for a moment at the geographical position of the whole fifteen cities, we see that they lay partly to the south of Jerusalem, on the road which went by Hebron to Beersheba and Egypt, partly on the western slopes of the hill country of Judah, on the road by Beit-Jibrin to Gaza, while only a few lay to the north of this road towards the Philistine plain, and there were none to the north to defend the kingdom against invasions from that side. "Rehoboam seems, therefore, to have had much more apprehension of an attack from the south and west, i.e., from the Egyptians, than of a war with the northern kingdom" (Berth.). Hence we may conclude that Rehoboam fortified these cities only after the inroad of the Egyptian king Shishak.</body></html>
