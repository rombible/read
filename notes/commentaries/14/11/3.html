In that case, the chronicler’s phrase is a mere abbreviation, denoting whatever of Israel was comprised in the two faithful tribes.

But there may be a hint that Judah and Benjamin were the true Israel, and that the apostate North had forfeited its right to that honourable name. Others suppose a reference to members of Northern tribes dwelling in the territory of Judah and Benjamin. Syriac, “to Rehoboam . . . and to the house of Benjamin, and to all Israel, and to the remnant of the people.” LXX., “to all Judah and Benjamin” simply.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-3.htm" title="Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,">2 Chronicles 11:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon </span>— Intimating that this was determined for the sin of Solomon, and therefore could not be reversed.

When we consider the mention of Rehoboam personally in the former clause of the verse, it would seem most probable that the meaning is all the people of the nation, resident in the Judah and Benjamin allotments, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nation called collectively Israel.
