In this way he secured their contentment and obviated quarrels for precedence, and intrigues against his destined successor. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm" title="But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.">Genesis 25:6</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/21-2.htm" title="And he had brothers the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.">2Chronicles 21:2-3</a>.)

Thus he that dealt foolishly at first, dealt wisely afterward in his affairs. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:13-23 When the priests and Levites came to Jerusalem, the devout, pious Israelites followed them. Such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel, left the inheritance of their fathers, and went to Jerusalem, that they might have free access to the altar of God, and be out of the temptation to worship the calves. That is best for us, which is best for our souls; in all our choices, religious advantages must be sought before all outward conveniences. Where God's faithful priests are, his faithful people should be. And when it has been proved that we are willing to renounce our worldly interests, so far as we are called to do so for the sake of Christ and his gospel, we have good evidence that we are truly his disciples. And it is the interest of a nation to protect religion and religious people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rehoboam's wisdom was shown:<p>(1) In dispersing his other sons instead of allowing them to remain together in Jerusalem, where they might have joined in a plot against Abijah, as Adonijah and his brothers had done against Solomon <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-10</a>;<p>(2) In giving his sons positions which might well content them and prevent them from being jealous of Abijah.<p>He desired many wives - (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>). Some prefer to connect the words with the preceding words. If so, they denote another point in which Rehoboam was careful to please his sons. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. he dealt wisely&#8212;that is, with deep and calculating policy (Ex 1:10).<p>and dispersed of all his children &#8230; unto every fenced city&#8212;The circumstance of twenty-eight sons of the king being made governors of fortresses would, in our quarter of the world, produce jealousy and dissatisfaction. But Eastern monarchs ensure peace and tranquillity to their kingdom by bestowing government offices on their sons and grandsons. They obtain an independent provision, and being kept apart, are not likely to cabal in their father's lifetime. Rehoboam acted thus, and his sagacity will appear still greater if the wives he desired for them belonged to the cities where each son was located. These connections would bind them more closely to their respective places. In the modern countries of the East, particularly Persia and Turkey, younger princes were, till very lately, shut up in the harem during their father's lifetime; and, to prevent competition, they were blinded or killed when their brother ascended the throne. In the former country the old practice of dispersing them through the country as Rehoboam did, has been again revived.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Dispersed of all his children:</span> lest his other sons should after his death unite their counsels and forces together against Abijah, he wisely dispersed them into several and distant places, and under pretence of honouring them with the government of them, he made them prisoners in a sort, appointing several persons to observe their motions, and prevent their combinations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto every fenced city, </span> agreeable to their quality, that their restraint might be more easy to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Desired many wives; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
