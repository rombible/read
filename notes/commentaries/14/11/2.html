This is the first historical mention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a>) of Shemaiah. The second is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5, 7</a>, on occasion of the invasion of Judah and Jerusalem by Shishak King of Egypt; and the third, in the same chapter, ver. 15, that he wrote a book respecting the acts of Rehoboam. The expression, "man of God," owns to a somewhat unexplained history. It is first found in the added part of Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>), where it is applied to Moses. It occurs once in Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>); twice in Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6, 8</a>); four times in Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6-8</a>); <span class="accented">twenty-nine</span> times in Kings; six times in Chronicles; once each in Ezra, Nehemiah and Jeremiah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This event is narrated in our chapter, except in so far as a few unessential differences in form are concerned, exactly as we have it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-19</a>; so that we may refer for the exposition of it to the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>, where we have both treated the contents of this chapter, and have also discussed the deeper and more latent causes of this event, so important in its consequences. </body></html>
