Deprived of his liberty, separated from his evil counsellors and companions, without any prospect but of ending his days in a wretched prison, Manasseh thought upon what had passed; he began to cry for mercy and deliverance. He confessed his sins, condemned himself, was humbled before God, loathing himself as a monster of impiety and wickedness. Yet he hoped to be pardoned through the abundant mercy of the Lord. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah was God, able to deliver. He knew him as a God of salvation; he learned to fear, trust in, love, and obey him. From this time he bore a new character, and walked in newness of life. Who can tell what tortures of conscience, what pangs of grief, what fears of wrath, what agonizing remorse he endured, when he looked back on his many years of apostacy and rebellion against God; on his having led thousands into sin and perdition; and on his blood-guiltiness in the persecution of a number of God's children? And who can complain that the way of heaven is blocked up, when he sees such a sinner enter? Say the worst against thyself, here is one as bad who finds the way to repentance. Deny not to thyself that which God hath not denied to thee; it is not thy sin, but thy impenitence, that bars heaven against thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The seers - Most moderns adopt the translation given in the margin of the Authorized Version, making Hosai (or rather, Chozai) a proper name.

"He built an outer wall of the city of David westward towards Gihon in the valley, and in the direction of the fish-gate; and he surrounded the Ophel, and made it very high." The words &#1492;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; (without the article) point to the building of a new wall. But since it has been already recorded of Hezekiah, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>, that he built "the other wall without," all modern expositors, even Arnold in Herz.'s Realenc. xviii. S. 634, assume the identity of the two walls, and understand &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503; of the completion and heightening of that "other wall" of which it is said &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1492;, and which shut in Zion from the lower city to the north. In that case, of course, we must make the correction &#1492;&#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;. The words "westward towards Gihon in the valley, and &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;, in the direction to (towards) the fish-gate," are then to be taken as describing the course of this wall from its centre, first towards the west, and then towards the east. For the valley of Gihon lay, in all probability, outside of the western city gate, which occupied the place of the present Jaffa gate. But the fish-gate was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-3.htm">Nehemiah 3:3</a>, at the east end of this wall, at no great distance from the tower on the north-east corner. The valley (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;) is a hollow between the upper city (Zion) and the lower (Acra), probably the beginning of the valley, which at its south-eastern opening, between Zion and Moriah, is called Tyropoion in Josephus. The words, "he surrounded the Ophel," sc. with a wall, are not to be connected with the preceding clauses, as Berth. connects them, translating, "he carried the wall from the north-east corner farther to the south, and then round the Ophel;" for "between the north-east corner and the Ophel wall lay the whole east wall of the city, as far as to the south-east corner of the temple area, which yet cannot be regarded as a continuation of the wall to the Ophel wall" (Arnold, loc. cit.). Jotham had already built a great deal at the Ophel wall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>). Manasseh must therefore only have strengthened it, and increased its height. On the words &#1513;&#1474; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-2.htm">2 Chronicles 17:2</a>. </body></html>
