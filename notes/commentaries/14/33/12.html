Say now, Manasseh, with that grand-father of thine, <span class="ital">It is good for me that I have been afflicted; </span>thine iron was more precious to thee than thy gold; thy jail was a more happy lodging to thee than thy palace; Babylon was a better school to thee than Jerusalem. How foolish are we to frown upon our afflictions! These, how severe soever, are our best friends: they are not indeed for our pleasure, they are for our profit; their issue makes them worthy of a welcome. What do we care how bitter that potion is which brings us health?”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:1-20 We have seen Manasseh's wickedness; here we have his repentance, and a memorable instance it is of the riches of God's pardoning mercy, and the power of his renewing grace. Deprived of his liberty, separated from his evil counsellors and companions, without any prospect but of ending his days in a wretched prison, Manasseh thought upon what had passed; he began to cry for mercy and deliverance. He confessed his sins, condemned himself, was humbled before God, loathing himself as a monster of impiety and wickedness. Yet he hoped to be pardoned through the abundant mercy of the Lord. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah was God, able to deliver. He knew him as a God of salvation; he learned to fear, trust in, love, and obey him. From this time he bore a new character, and walked in newness of life. Who can tell what tortures of conscience, what pangs of grief, what fears of wrath, what agonizing remorse he endured, when he looked back on his many years of apostacy and rebellion against God; on his having led thousands into sin and perdition; and on his blood-guiltiness in the persecution of a number of God's children? And who can complain that the way of heaven is blocked up, when he sees such a sinner enter? Say the worst against thyself, here is one as bad who finds the way to repentance. Deny not to thyself that which God hath not denied to thee; it is not thy sin, but thy impenitence, that bars heaven against thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Assyrian monuments contain no record of this expedition; but there can be little doubt that it fell into the reign of Esarhaddon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a> note), who reigned at least thirteen years.

The calamities forced upon him a review of his past life, under a conviction that the miseries of his dethronement and captive condition were owing to his awful and unprecedented apostasy (2Ch 33:7) from the God of his fathers. He humbled himself, repented, and prayed for an opportunity of bringing forth the fruits of repentance. His prayer was heard; for his conqueror not only released him, but, after two years' exile, restored him, with honor and the full exercise of royal power, to a tributary and dependent kingdom. Some political motive, doubtless, prompted the Assyrian king to restore Manasseh, and that was most probably to have the kingdom of Judah as a barrier between Egypt and his Assyrian dominions. But God overruled this measure for higher purposes. Manasseh now showed himself, by the influence of sanctified affliction, a new and better man. He made a complete reversal of his former policy, by not only destroying all the idolatrous statues and altars he had formerly erected in Jerusalem, but displaying the most ardent zeal in restoring and encouraging the worship of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he was in affliction,....

Here and there an expression is rhetorically generalized and intensified, e.g., by the plurals &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3</a>) instead of the sing. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; (Kings), and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>) instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>); by the addition of &#1493;&#1499;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1507; to &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, and of the name the Vale of Hinnom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a> (see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-18.htm">Joshua 15:18</a>, &#1490;&#1468;&#1497; for &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;); by heaping up words for the law and its commandments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-8.htm">2 Chronicles 33:8</a>); and other small deviations, of which &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-7.htm">2 Chronicles 33:7</a>) instead of &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; (Kings) is the most important.
