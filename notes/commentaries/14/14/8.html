The entire male population capable of bearing arms must be included in these high figures. Of course, such a thing as a standing army of this strength is not to be thought of.<p>The proportion of Benjamin relatively to Judah appears much too high. It must, however, be remembered that Benjamin was always famous as a tribe of warriors.

Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right in their own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God's sight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it gives us rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation. Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace they enjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, nor secure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. This evil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa's prayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectation from God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, and all things work together for the good of those whom he favours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The men of Judah served as heavy-armed troops, while the Benjamites were light-armed. Their numbers accord well with those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>. As the boundaries of Judah had been enlarged <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>, and as for ten years at least there had been no war <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1</a>, the effective force had naturally increased.

He had also an army of five hundred eighty thousand men. Judah furnished the heavily armed soldiers, and Benjamin the archers. This large number does not mean a body of professional soldiers, but all capable of bearing arms and liable to be called into service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Asa had an army; </span> which, as it seems, he had now gathered together upon the information of Zerah’s design against him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand,....

The Chronicler divides Asa’s army into the heavy-armed men belonging to Judah and the light-armed bowmen belonging to Benjamin. Asa apparently had no chariots, “targets” and “shields” should be transposed as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm" title="And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of Judah three hundred thousand … of Benjamin … two hundred and fourscore thousand</span>] The total is 580,000. Under Asa’s successor, Jehoshaphat, the numbers are (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/17-14.htm" title="And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand....">2 Chronicles 17:14-18</a>), Judah 780,000, Benjamin 380,000, making a total of 1,160,000, i.e. the double of the total given above. Whether the Chronicler drew these numbers from any ancient document is not known, but his main point seems to be that Judah was strong in the early days of Asa, while Asa shewed faith in God, and that Judah became still stronger under his really religious successor, Jehoshaphat. It is to be noted that it is <span class="ital">not</span> said that Asa brought these 580,000 men into the field against the Ethiopians; cp. note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm" title="And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The "ten years' quiet" (ver. 1) begins to see its end. <span class="cmt_word">Targets</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a>); spears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12</a>); for both, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-24.htm">1 Chronicles 12:24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Out of Benjamin...   shields and...  bows</span>.

The good and right in God's eyes which Asa did is further defined in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2-4</a>. He abolished all the objects of the idolatrous worship. The "altars of the strangers" are altars consecrated to foreign gods; from them the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, high places, are distinguished-these latter being illegal places of sacrifice connected with the worship of Jahve (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>).

Asa at the same time commanded the people to worship Jahve, the God of the fathers, and to follow the law.</body></html>
