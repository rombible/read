Those who begin with God, begin at the right end of their work, and it will prosper accordingly. Those that turn their backs upon God's ordinances, may truly be said to forsake God himself. There are still such neglects, if the word be not duly read and opened, for that was signified by the lighting the lamps, and also if prayers and praise be not offered up, for that was signified by the burning incense. Neglect of God's worship was the cause of the calamities they had lain under. The Lord alone can prepare the heart of man for vital godliness: when much good is done in a little time, the glory must be ascribed to him; and all who love him or the souls of men, will rejoice therein.

Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God&#8212;Convinced of the sin and bitter fruits of idolatry, Hezekiah intended to reverse the policy of his father, and to restore, in all its ancient purity and glory, the worship of the true God. His commencement of this resolution at the beginning of his reign attests his sincere piety. It also proves the strength of his conviction that righteousness exalteth a nation; for, instead of waiting till his throne was consolidated, he devised measures of national reformation at the beginning of his reign and vigorously faced all the difficulties which, in such a course, he had to encounter, after the people's habits had so long been moulded to idolatry. His intentions were first disclosed to this meeting of the priests and Levites&#8212;for the agency of these officials was to be employed in carrying them into effect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My sons; </span> so he calls them indifferently, though many of them were elder than himself, because he was by his tender love and affection, as he was by his office obliged to be, a nursing-father to them.

"Our fathers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>), that is, Ahaz and his contemporaries, for only these had been guilty of displeasing God in the ways mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>, "have turned away their face from the dwelling of Jahve, and turned their back (upon it)."
