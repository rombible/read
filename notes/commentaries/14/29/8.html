Those who begin with God, begin at the right end of their work, and it will prosper accordingly. Those that turn their backs upon God's ordinances, may truly be said to forsake God himself. There are still such neglects, if the word be not duly read and opened, for that was signified by the lighting the lamps, and also if prayers and praise be not offered up, for that was signified by the burning incense. Neglect of God's worship was the cause of the calamities they had lain under. The Lord alone can prepare the heart of man for vital godliness: when much good is done in a little time, the glory must be ascribed to him; and all who love him or the souls of men, will rejoice therein.

Wherefore the wrath of the Lord was upon Judah and Jerusalem&#8212;This pious king had the discernment to ascribe all the national calamities that had befallen the kingdom to the true cause, namely, apostasy from God. The country had been laid waste by successive wars of invasion, and its resources drained. Many families mourned members of their household still suffering the miseries of foreign captivity; all their former prosperity and glory had fled; and to what was this painful and humiliating state of affairs to be traced, but to the manifest judgment of God upon the kingdom for its sins?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To astonishment and to hissing, </span> i.e. to such calamities as all that see and hear of shall be astonished at, and hiss at those who by their own sin and folly have brought such miseries upon themselves. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm" title="And at this house, which is high, every one that passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why has the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?">1 Kings 9:8</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore the wrath of the Lord was upon.

In the first year of his reign, in the first month, Hezekiah caused the temple doors to be opened, and the priests and Levites to assemble, in order that he might rouse them by an energetic address to purify the house of God from all the uncleannesses of idolatry (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3-11</a>). They, vigorously commencing the work, completed the purification of the temple with its courts and vessels in sixteen days, and reported to the king what had been done (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-12.htm">2 Chronicles 29:12-19</a>); and then the king and the chiefs of the city offered a great sacrifice to consecrate the purified sanctuary, upon which followed burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and thankofferings of the whole assembly (vv. 20-36). </body></html>
