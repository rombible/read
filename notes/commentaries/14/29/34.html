Many of them, it is probable, had been suspended and laid aside as polluted, for having sacrificed to idols in the last reign, and the rest had not the zeal that might have been expected on such an occasion. Therefore they took no care to sanctify themselves: and being unsanctified, and so unqualified, they made their excuse for being absent from the service; as if their offence would be their defence. It is recorded here, to the perpetual shame of the priests, that though they were so well provided for out of the offerings of the Lord, yet they did not mind their business. Here was work to do, and there wanted proper hands to do it. <span class="ital">So that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings — </span>And much less all the other sacrifices, which were more numerous; the flaying whereof was the priests’ proper work, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation....">Leviticus 1:5-6</a>. <span class="ital">Wherefore the priests did help them — </span>Necessity excusing a deviation from the rule, as it hath excused in other cases. <span class="ital">For the Levites were more upright in heart, &c., than the priests — </span>They were better affected to the work, and better prepared and qualified for it. This was their praise; and, in recompense for it, they had the honour of being employed in that which was the priests’ work. Thus encouragement was given to the faithful, zealous Levites, and a just disgrace cast upon the careless priests. What the Levites wanted in the ceremonial advantages of their birth and consecration, was abundantly made up in their eminent qualifications of knowledge and zeal for the work. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:20-36 As soon as Hezekiah heard that the temple was ready, he lost no time. Atonement must be made for the sins of the last reign. It was not enough to lament and forsake those sins; they brought a sin-offering. Our repentance and reformation will not obtain pardon but in and through Christ, who was made sin, that is, a sin-offering for us. While the offerings were on the altar, the Levites sang. Sorrow for sin must not prevent us from praising God. The king and the congregation gave their consent to all that was done. It is not enough for us to be where God is worshipped, if we do not ourselves worship with the heart. And we should offer up our spiritual sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, and devote ourselves and all we have, as sacrifices, acceptable to the Father only through the Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Levites were more upright etc - See the marginal reference. Urijah, the high priest, had participated to some extent in the impieties of Ahaz <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-16</a>. He and many of the priests may, therefore, have looked coldly on the reforming zeal of Hezekiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34-36. the priests were too few, &#8230; wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them&#8212;The skins of beasts intended as peace offerings might be taken off by the officers, because, in such cases, the carcass was not wholly laid upon the altar; but animals meant for burnt offerings which were wholly consumed by fire could be flayed by the priests alone, not even the Levites being allowed to touch them, except in cases of unavoidable necessity (2Ch 35:11). The duty being assigned by the law to the priests (Le 1:6), was construed by consuetudinary practice as an exclusion of all others not connected with the Aaronic family.<p>for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests&#8212;that is, displayed greater alacrity than the priests. This service was hastened by the irrepressible solicitude of the king. Whether it was that many of the priests, being absent in the country, had not arrived in time&#8212;whether from the long interruption of the public duties, some of them had relaxed in their wonted attentions to personal cleanliness, and had many preparations to make&#8212;or whether from some having participated in the idolatrous services introduced by Ahaz, they were backward in repairing to the temple&#8212;a reflection does seem to be cast upon their order as dilatory and not universally ready for duty (compare 2Ch 30:15). Thus was the newly consecrated temple reopened to the no small joy of the pious king and all the people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The priests were too few, </span> to wit, such as were sanctified and fit for their work, as the following words show; for otherwise the number of the priests was more than sufficient for this employment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They could not flay all the burnt-offerings; </span> and much less all the other sacrifices, which were more numerous; the flaying whereof was the priest’s proper work, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>,6</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Levites did help them; </span> necessity excusing their deviation from the rule, as it hath excused others in like cases. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings,....

Later the Levites performed these duties, and on great public occasions, at any rate, the priests themselves. The simple tale of this verse speaks volumes of the state of the ecclesiastical profession and of the ecclesiastical heart at this very time. Into the dishonoured sepulchre already two or three unsuspected and apparently unacknowledged chinks had let in reproving light as to this, and very lately the almost unavoidable inferences respecting Urijah (see note on our ver. 1, and on 2 Chronicles 28:24, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-16</a>) served the same purpose. How true to nature and to history, both secular and ecclesiastical also, the superiority, in sincerity and life and preparation for work, of the subordinates (<span class="cmt_word">the Levites</span>), to those who fed on dignity rather than maintained it, in the highest sense, by religious life and conscientious practice! <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>During the offering of the burnt-offering, until it was ended, the whole congregation stood worshipping; and the song of the Levites, accompanied by the music of the stringed instruments and the trumpet-blowing of the priests, continued. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, "the song was singing," stands for "the body of singers sang;" and the trumpets also stand for the trumpeters. </body></html>
