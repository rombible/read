Those who begin with God, begin at the right end of their work, and it will prosper accordingly. Those that turn their backs upon God's ordinances, may truly be said to forsake God himself. There are still such neglects, if the word be not duly read and opened, for that was signified by the lighting the lamps, and also if prayers and praise be not offered up, for that was signified by the burning incense. Neglect of God's worship was the cause of the calamities they had lain under. The Lord alone can prepare the heart of man for vital godliness: when much good is done in a little time, the glory must be ascribed to him; and all who love him or the souls of men, will rejoice therein.

He collected all the vessels of the house of God together, and broke them in pieces. These words also are rhetorical, so that neither the &#1497;&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, which depicts the matter vividly, nor the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, is to be pressed. The &#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1509; of the vessels consisted, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>, in this, that he mutilated the artistically wrought vessels of the court, and cut out the panels from the bases, and took away the lavers from them, and took down the brazen sea from the oxen on which it stood, and set it upon a pavement of stones. "And he closed the doors of the house of Jahve," in order to put an end to the Jahve-worship in the temple, which he regarded as superfluous, since he had erected altars at the corners of all the streets in Jerusalem, and in all the cities of Judah. The statement as to the closing of the temple doors, to which reference is made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>, is said by Berth. not to reset upon good historical recollection, because the book of Kings not only does not say anything of it, but also clearly gives us to understand that Ahaz allowed the Jahve-worship to continue, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-15.htm">2 Kings 16:15</a>. That the book of Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>) makes no mention of this circumstance does not prove much, it being an argumentum e silentio; for the book of Kings is not a complete history, it contains only a short excerpt from the history of the kings; while the intimation given us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-15.htm">2 Kings 16:15</a>. as to the continuation of the worship of Jahve, may without difficulty be reconciled with the closing of the temple doors. The &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; are not the gates of the court of the temple, but, according to the clear explanation of the Chronicle, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>, the doors of the porch, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3</a> are also called doors of the house of Jahve; the "house of Jahve" signifying here not the whole group of temple buildings, but, in the narrower sense of the words, denoting only the main body of the temple (the Holy Place and the Most Holy, wherein Jahve was enthroned). By the closing of the doors of the porch the worship of Jahve in the Holy Place and the Most Holy was indeed suspended, but the worship at the altar in the court was not thereby necessarily interfered with: it might still continue. Now it is the worship at the altar of burnt-offering alone of which it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-15.htm">2 Kings 16:15</a> that Ahaz allowed it to continue to this extent, that he ordered the priest Urijah to offer all the burnt-offerings and sacrifices, meat-offerings and drink-offerings, which were offered morning and evening by both king and people, not upon the copper sacrificial altar (Solomon's), but on the altar built after the pattern of that which he had seen at Damascus. The cessation of worship at this altar is also left unmentioned by the Chronicle, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>. Hezekiah, when he again opened the doors of the house of Jahve, only says to the priests and Levites, "Our fathers have forsaken Jahve, and turned their backs on His sanctuary; yea, have shut the doors of the porch, put out the lamps, and have not burnt incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the Holy Place unto the God of Israel." Sacrificing upon an altar built after a heathen model was not sacrificing to the God of Israel. There is therefore no ground to doubt the historical truth of the statement in our verse. The description of the idolatrous conduct of Ahaz concludes with the remark, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-25.htm">2 Chronicles 28:25</a>, that Ahaz thereby provoked Jahve, the God of his fathers, to anger. </body></html>
