The longest sword, he thinks, must determine the matter, not the better cause.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-22 Abijah overcomes Jeroboam. - Jeroboam and his people, by apostacy and idolatry, merited the severe punishment Abijah was permitted to execute upon them. It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seven rams - "A bullock and two rams" was the offering which God had required at the original consecration of the sons of Aaron <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a>.

But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them&#8212;The oration of Abijah, however animating an effect it might have produced on his own troops, was unheeded by the party to whom it was addressed; for while he was wasting time in useless words, Jeroboam had ordered a detachment of his men to move quietly round the base of the hill, so that when Abijah stopped speaking, he and his followers found themselves surprised in the rear, while the main body of the Israelitish forces remained in front. A panic might have ensued, had not the leaders "cried unto the Lord," and the priests "sounded with the trumpets"&#8212;the pledge of victory (Nu 10:9; 31:6). Reassured by the well-known signal, the men of Judah responded with a war shout, which, echoed by the whole army, was followed by an impetuous rush against the foe. The shock was resistless. The ranks of the Israelites were broken, for "God smote Jeroboam and all Israel." They took to flight, and the merciless slaughter that ensued can be accounted for only by tracing it to the rancorous passions enkindled by a civil war.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whilst Abijah was discoursing, Jeroboam takes the advantage of it to lay an ambush. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them,....

"And Jeroboam, the servant of Solomon the son of David (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11</a>), rebelled against his lord," with the help of frivolous, worthless men (&#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a>; &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a> -not recurring elsewhere in the Chronicle), who gathered around him, and rose against Rehoboam with power. &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509;, to show oneself powerful, to show power against any one.

This representation does not conform to the state of the case as narrated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10.htm">2 Chronicles 10</a>. Rehoboam did not appear soft-hearted and compliant in the negotiation with the rebellious tribes at Sichem; on the contrary, he was hard and defiant, and showed himself youthfully inconsiderate only in throwing to the winds the wise advice of the older men, and in pursuance of the rash counsel of the young men who had grown up with him, brought about the rupture by his domineering manner. But Abijah wishes to justify his father as much as possible in his speech, and shifts all the guilt of the rebellion of the ten tribes from the house of David on to Jeroboam and his worthless following.</body></html>
