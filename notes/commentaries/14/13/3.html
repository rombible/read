And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred three score and ten thousand men that drew sword.">1Chronicles 21:5</a>). The numbers of the verse present a yet closer agreement with the results of that census as reported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm" title="And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.">2Samuel 24:9</a>; where, as here, the total strength of the Israelite warriors is given as 800,000, and that of Judah as 500,000. This correspondence makes it improbable that the figures have been falsified in transmission.

It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It has been proposed to change the numbers, here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-17.htm">2 Chronicles 13:17</a>, into 40,000, 80,000, and 50,000 respectively - partly because these smaller numbers are found in many early editions of the Vulgate, but mainly because the larger ones are thought to be incredible. The numbers accord well, however, with the census of the people taken in the reign of David <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>, joined to the fact which the writer has related <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-17</a>, of a considerable subsequent emigration from the northern kingdom into the southern one. The total adult male population at the time of the census was 1,570, 000. The total of the fighting men now is 1,200, 000. This would allow for the aged and infirm 370, 000, or nearly a fourth of the whole. And in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-17.htm">2 Chronicles 13:17</a>, our author may be understood to mean that this was the entire Israelite loss in the course of the war, which probably continued through the whole reign of Abijah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Abijah set the battle in array&#8212;that is, took the field and opened the campaign.<p>with &#8230; four hundred thousand chosen men &#8230; Jeroboam with eight hundred thousand&#8212;These are, doubtless, large numbers, considering the smallness of the two kingdoms. It must be borne in mind, however, that Oriental armies are mere mobs&#8212;vast numbers accompanying the camp in hope of plunder, so that the gross numbers described as going upon an Asiatic expedition are often far from denoting the exact number of fighting men. But in accounting for the large number of soldiers enlisted in the respective armies of Abijah and Jeroboam, there is no need of resorting to this mode of explanation; for we know by the census of David the immense number of the population that was capable of bearing arms (1Ch 21:5; compare 2Ch 14:8; 17:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Abijah set the battle in array</span> against Jeroboam.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm" title="And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.">2 Samuel 24:9</a> (David’s numbering) the fighting men of Israel are given at 800,000 and the fighting men of Judah at 500,000. Similarly the Chronicler may mean to state here the whole armed strength of Israel and Judah without committing himself to the number of those who actually took the field. The language is not precise, for the Chronicler is little interested in military details. It should be noted, moreover, that the numbers precede the mention of the battlefield, and therefore are not <span class="ital">necessarily</span> to be included in the account of the fight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Similarly it is to be noted that the Chronicler does <span class="ital">not</span> say in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-17.htm" title="And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.">2 Chronicles 13:17</a> that 500,000 of Israel fell <span class="ital">in one day</span> (contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-6.htm" title="For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>). Rather, he implies that the war continued for some time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm" title="And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3–20 (no parallel in 1 Kin.).

It would be, however, a great relief to faith to be able to <span class="accented">give proof</span> that this treatment would be true to fact. At present the numbers can be shown to be consistent with other numbers, such as those of the entire man-population (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-17</a>); and this seems the best that can be said in support of them. It does not, however, suffice to bring comfortable conviction. It is remarkable, among the difficulties that the question entails, that we do not get any satisfactory explanation as to how such vast numbers of slain bodies were <span class="accented">disposed</span> of in a compass of ground comparatively so small. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The length of Rehoboam's reign, his mother, and the judgment about him.
