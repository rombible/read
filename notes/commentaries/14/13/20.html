The expressions of the text cannot mean, as Zöckler suggests, “visited him with misfortune till his death.” His death is regarded as a judicial visitation (compare the use of the same Hebrew phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-38.htm" title="And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.">1Samuel 25:38</a>). The verse, then, states that during the rest of Abijah’s reign Jeroboam remained powerless to injure his neighbour; and that the circumstances of his death were such that men recognised in them “the finger of God.” It is not likely that the reference is to the event of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm" title="Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.">2Chronicles 13:15</a> (Bertheau), nor to the death of his son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/14-1.htm" title="At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.">1Kings 14:1-8</a>), as Keil supposes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-20.htm" title="Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.">2 Chronicles 13:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord struck him </span>— Either with vexation and horror of mind, or with some painful and lingering, but incurable disease, like that of Jehoram, which tormented him two years together, and at last killed him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-19.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases.

It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jeroboam's death was a judgment upon him for his sins. Chronologically speaking, his death is here out of place, for he outlived Abijah at least two years (compare the marginal reference and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9</a>); but the writer, not intending to recur to his history, is naturally led to carry it on to its termination. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

He lived, indeed, two years after the death of Abijah (1Ki 14:20; 15:9).

Jeroboam caused the ambush (the troops appointed to be an ambush) to go round about, so as to come upon their rear (i.e., of the men of Judah); and so they (the main division of Jeroboam's troops) were before Judah, and the ambush in their rear (i.e., of the men of Judah); and the men of Judah, when they turned themselves (scil. to attack), saw war before and behind them, i.e., perceived that they were attacked in front and rear. In this dangerous position the men of Judah cried to the Lord, and the priests blew the trumpets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm">2 Chronicles 13:15</a>); and as they raised this war-cry, God smote their enemies so that they took to flight.
