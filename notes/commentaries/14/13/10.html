What Abijah here states is surely true—viz.,that Judah had maintained the Levitical priesthood, and its associated worship. And the following words prove this to be his meaning: “and the priests which minister unto the Lord <span class= "ital">are the sons of Aaron;</span> and <span class= "ital">the Levites</span> wait upon their business,” (literally, <span class= "ital">are in the work</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The work of the service of Jehovah could be duly performed by none but Levites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-10.htm" title="But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister to the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait on their business:">2 Chronicles 13:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">But the Lord is our God — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">Jehovah, </span>the only true and great God. <span class="ital">And we have not forsaken him — </span>We maintain his honour and worship, which you have ungratefully rejected.

It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seven rams - "A bullock and two rams" was the offering which God had required at the original consecration of the sons of Aaron <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a>.

Abijah stood up upon Mount Zemaraim&#8212;He had entered the enemy's territory and was encamped on an eminence near Beth-el (Jos 18:22). Jeroboam's army lay at the foot of the hill, and as a pitched battle was expected, Abijah, according to the singular usage of ancient times, harangued the enemy. The speakers in such circumstances, while always extolling their own merits, poured out torrents of invective and virulent abuse upon the adversary. So did Abijah. He dwelt on the divine right of the house of David to the throne; and sinking all reference to the heaven-condemned offenses of Solomon and the divine appointment of Jeroboam, as well as the divine sanction of the separation, he upbraided Jeroboam as a usurper, and his subjects as rebels, who took advantage of the youth and inexperience of Rehoboam. Then contrasting the religious state of the two kingdoms, he drew a black picture of the impious innovations and gross idolatry introduced by Jeroboam, with his expulsion and impoverishment (2Ch 11:14) of the Levites. He dwelt with reasonable pride on the pure and regular observance of the ancient institutions of Moses in his own dominion [2Ch 13:11] and concluded with this emphatic appeal: "O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">Jehovah</span>, the only true and great God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We have not forsaken him; </span> we maintain his honour and worship, which you have ungratefully rejected. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But as for us, the Lord is our God,....

Part of the ideal of the Priestly Code was that the Levites should be restricted to the duty of helping the priests, and should be prevented from executing priestly functions themselves. With this ideal the Chronicler plainly sympathised, but it could not always be realised.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - The professions summarized in these two verses were confessedly formally true of the king and priests and nation, although Abijah and kingdom certainly did not carry a clean conscience in them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11, 16, 19</a>). They were, moreover, beyond a doubt really true of multitudes of <span class="accented">individuals in the</span> kingdom of Judah and Benjamin.

If all the difference that these words have it in them to express could have been put to the credit of Abijsh, what tremendous strength would have now belonged to his position and to his heart! <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the two armies lay over against each other, ready for the combat, Abijah addressed the enemy, King Jeroboam and all Israel, in a speech from Mount Zemaraim. The mountain &#1510;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is met with only here; but a city of this name is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a>, whence we would incline to the conclusion that the mountain near or upon which this city lay was intended. But if this city was situated to the east, not only of Bethel, but also of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a>), as we may conclude from its enumeration between Beth-arabah and Bethel in Josh. loc. cit., it will not suit our passage, at least if Zemaraim be really represented by the ruin el Sumra to the east of Khan Hadur on the way from Jerusalem to Jericho. Robinson (Phys. Geog. S. 38) conjectures Mount Zemaraim to the east of Bethel, near the border of the two kingdoms, to which Mount Ephraim also extends. Abijah represented first of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5-7</a>) to Jeroboam and the Israelites that their kingdom was the result of a revolt against Jahve, who had given the kingship over Israel to David and his sons for ever.</body></html>
