(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-41.htm" title="And you shall put them on Aaron your brother, and his sons with him; and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-9.htm" title="And you shall gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>.) Every one that came with the prescribed sacrifices (see Exodus 29) was admissible to the new priesthood. The phrase “a young bullock and seven rams” is not a full account of the sacrifices required by the law of Moses for the consecration of a priest. Perhaps Abijah did not care to be exact; but it is quite possible that Jeroboam had modified the Mosaic rule.<p>The compound substantive “no-gods” (<span class= "ital">lō’ ’elôhîm</span>) is like <span class= "ital">lō’ ’êl</span> and <span class= "ital">lō’ ’elōah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm" title="They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>).

It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seven rams - "A bullock and two rams" was the offering which God had required at the original consecration of the sons of Aaron <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a>.

Abijah stood up upon Mount Zemaraim&#8212;He had entered the enemy's territory and was encamped on an eminence near Beth-el (Jos 18:22). Jeroboam's army lay at the foot of the hill, and as a pitched battle was expected, Abijah, according to the singular usage of ancient times, harangued the enemy. The speakers in such circumstances, while always extolling their own merits, poured out torrents of invective and virulent abuse upon the adversary. So did Abijah. He dwelt on the divine right of the house of David to the throne; and sinking all reference to the heaven-condemned offenses of Solomon and the divine appointment of Jeroboam, as well as the divine sanction of the separation, he upbraided Jeroboam as a usurper, and his subjects as rebels, who took advantage of the youth and inexperience of Rehoboam. Then contrasting the religious state of the two kingdoms, he drew a black picture of the impious innovations and gross idolatry introduced by Jeroboam, with his expulsion and impoverishment (2Ch 11:14) of the Levites. He dwelt with reasonable pride on the pure and regular observance of the ancient institutions of Moses in his own dominion [2Ch 13:11] and concluded with this emphatic appeal: "O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To consecrate himself, </span> i. e. to make himself a priest. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-37.htm" title="This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;">Leviticus 7:37</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That are no gods; </span> that have nothing of the nature or power, though you give them the name of gods. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Have ye not cast out the priests of the Lord the sons of Aaron, and the Levites,....
