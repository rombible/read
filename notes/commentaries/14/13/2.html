This is confirmed by the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic, which read Maachah. As we have already stated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm" title="And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.">2Chronicles 11:20</a>), Maachah was <span class= "ital">granddaughter</span> to Absalom, being a daughter of Tamar the only daughter of Absalom. Uriel of Gibeah, then, must have been the husband of Tamar. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.">2Chronicles 15:16</a>.

It appears from the character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. His mother's name also was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel&#8212;the same as Maachah (see on [435]1Ki 15:2). She was "the daughter," that is, granddaughter of Absalom (1Ki 15:2; compare 2Sa 14:1-33), mother of Abijah, "mother," that is, grandmother (1Ki 15:10, Margin) of Asa.<p>of Gibeah&#8212;probably implies that Uriel was connected with the house of Saul.<p>there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam&#8212;The occasion of this war is not recorded (see 1Ki 15:6, 7), but it may be inferred from the tenor of Abijah's address that it arose from his youthful ambition to recover the full hereditary dominion of his ancestors.

As before noted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>), and as in the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>), this name is one with "Maachah, daughter of Absalom" (parallel, <span class="accented">Abishalom</span>). The different alphabetic characters may be attributed to error, and that error the error of transcription merely. As in our note (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>), the word "daughter," as in many similar cases, stands for granddaughter. Thus the father of Maachah was Uriel of Gibeah, and her mother Tamar, daughter of Absalom. Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:10. &sect; 1) proffers us this connecting link of explanation. On the other hand, Rabbi Joseph's Targum on Chronicles says that Uriel means Absalom, but was a name used to avoid the use of Absalom. We have no clue as to which out of many Gibeahs is here intended. The Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>) signifies a hill with round top, and hence would easily give name to many places. The following are the chief places of the name (as classified by Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:689-691): <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Gibeah in the mountain district of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-57.htm">Joshua 15:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-49.htm">1 Chronicles 2:49</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Gibeath among the towns of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The Gibeah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3, 4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Gibeah of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19, 20</a>.), between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.

Josephus ('Bell, Jud.,' 5:2. &sect; 1) states what helps to the identifying of the place as the modern <span class="accented">Tuleil-el-ful</span>, about thirty stadia from Jerusalem (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>).

Shishak plundered the treasures of the temple and the palace; he had consequently captured Jerusalem. The golden shields also which had been placed in the house of the forest of Lebanon, i.e., the palace built by Solomon in Jerusalem, which Solomon had caused to be made (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a>), Shishak took away, and in their place Rehoboam caused brazen shields to be prepared; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26-28</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-12.htm">2 Chronicles 12:12</a> the author of the Chronicle concludes the account of this event with the didactic remark, "Because he (Rehoboam) humbled himself, the anger of Jahve was turned away from him." &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, and it was not to extermination utterly (&#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, properly to destruction, i.e., completely; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>). And also in Judah were good things. This is the other motive which caused the Lord to turn away His wrath. Good things are proofs of piety and fear of God, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>. </body></html>
