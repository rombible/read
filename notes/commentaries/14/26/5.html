Some Hebrew MSS., and the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic versions, and the Targum, read, “in the fear of God.” This is doubtless correct; and the text should be rendered. “who had understanding (or <span class= "ital">gave instruction</span>) in the fear of God.” So the famous Rabbis, Rashi and Kimchi, long since suggested. Zechariah was thus the guide and counsellor of king Uzziah, and that not only in religious matters, but in what we should call the political sphere; for in those days the distinction between things sacred and secular, civil and ecclesiastical, between Church and State, religion and common life, was wholly unknown.<p><span class= "bld">And as long as he sought.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">in the days of his seeking.</span><p><span class= "bld">The Lord, God</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>—Such a mode of speech reveals the chronicler’s own hand.<p>Instead of this verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-4.htm" title="Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.">2Kings 15:4</a> makes the deduction usual in its estimate of the character of a reign: “Only the high places were not taken away; the people still used to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places.”<p>The power and prosperity of Uzziah are accounted for by the chronicler on the ground that he sought God during the life of Zechariah; although afterwards he offended by rashly intruding upon the priest’s office, and was punished with leprosy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.">2Chronicles 26:16-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm" title="And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.">2 Chronicles 26:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">He sought God in the days of Zechariah </span>— Who was probably the son of that Zechariah whom his grand-father Joash slew. <span class="ital">Who had understanding in the visions of God — </span>Either the visions with which he himself was favoured, or the visions of the preceding prophets.

Happy are the great men who have such about them, and are willing to be advised by them: but unhappy those who seek God only while they have such with them, and have not a principle in themselves to bear them out to the end.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:1-15 As long as Uzziah sought the Lord, and minded religion, God made him to prosper. Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who had understanding in the visions of God - Another reading, supported by the Septuagint, and some ancient versions, is: "who instructed him in the fear of God." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. he sought God in the days of Zechariah&#8212;a wise and pious counsellor, who was skilled in understanding the meaning and lessons of the ancient prophecies, and who wielded a salutary influence over Uzziah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He sought God, </span> i.e. he persisted in the true religion and worship of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the days of Zechariah; </span> as long as he lived.

Twice in the foregoing chapter we have read of "a man of God" and "a prophet" whose names are not given.
