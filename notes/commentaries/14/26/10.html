Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable.

Also he built towers in the desert&#8212;for the threefold purpose of defense, of observation, and of shelter to his cattle. He dug also a great many wells, for he loved and encouraged all branches of agriculture. Some of these "were in the desert," that is, in the district to the southeast of Jerusalem, on the west of the Dead Sea, an extensive grazing district "in the low country" lying between the mountains of Judah and the Mediterranean; "and in the plains," east of the Jordan, within the territory of Reuben (De 4:43; Jos 20:8).<p>in Carmel&#8212;This mountain, being within the boundary of Israel, did not belong to Uzziah; and as it is here placed in opposition to the vine-bearing mountains, it is probably used, not as a proper name, but to signify, as the word denotes, "fruitful fields" (Margin).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He built towers in the desert; </span> partly to guard his cattle from the inroads and depredations which the Arabians were accustomed to make; and partly to give notice of the approach of any enemy, and to give some stop to their march on that side. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Also he built towers in the desert,....

Uzziah (&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;) is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a> and in 2 Kings generally) Azariah (&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;); cf. on the use of the two names, the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>, instead of the standing formula, "only the high places were not removed," etc.) Kings), Uzziah's attitude towards the Lord is more exactly defined thus: "He was seeking God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God; and in the days when he sought Jahve, God gave him success." In &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; the infinitive with &#1500; is subordinated to &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, to express the duration of his seeking, for which the participle is elsewhere used. Nothing further is known of the Zechariah here mentioned: the commentators hold him to have been an important prophet; for had he been a priest, or the high priest, probably &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; would have been used. The reading &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (Keth.) is surprising. &#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489; can only denote, who had insight into (or understanding for the) seeing of God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>. But Kimchi's idea, which other old commentators share, that this is a periphrasis to denote the prophetic endowment or activity of the man, is opposed by this, that "the seeing of God" which was granted to the elders of Israel at the making of the covenant, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>, cannot be regarded as a thing within the sphere of human action or practice, while the prophetic beholding in vision is essentially different from the seeing of God, and is, moreover, never so called. &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; would therefore seem to be an orthographical error for &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;, some MSS having &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. de Rossi, variae lectt.); and the lxx, Syr., Targ., Arab., Raschi, Kimchi, and others giving the reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, who was a teacher (instructor) in the fear of God, in favour of which also Vitringa, proll. in Jes. p. 4, has decided. </body></html>
