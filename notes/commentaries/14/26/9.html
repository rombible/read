Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the Mehunims or Maonites, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-12.htm">Judges 10:12</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 26:9, 10.

The sites of the principal of these towers were: at the corner gate (2Ch 25:23), the northwest corner of the city; at the valley gate on the west, where the Joppa gate now is; at the "turning"&#8212;a curve in the city wall on the eastern side of Zion. The town, at this point, commanded the horse gate which defended Zion and the temple hill on the southeast [Bertheau].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,....

As many as three sites, reducible perhaps to two, are proposed for this gate: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the west gate, called somewhile the "Jaffa" gate; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a gate over the valley of" Hinnom;" or, if it be not the same, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that at the valley of Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">And at the turning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. This word occurs eleven times, viz. twice in Exodus, four times in Nehemiah, four times in Ezekiel, and in this place, and is always rendered "corner" or" turning;" the word wanted is <span class="accented">angle.</span> The site of this gate cannot very certainly be pronounced upon. Perhaps the angle that marks the gate is that at the south-east corner of the temple plateau. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a> is our best clue: "Next to him Ezer repaired...  a piece over against the going up to the armoury <span class="accented">at the turning."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The statements as to Uzziah's attainment of dominion, the building of the seaport town Elath on the Red Sea, the length and character of his reign (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1-4</a>), agree entirely with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21-22</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2-3</a>; see the commentary on these passages. Uzziah (&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;) is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a> and in 2 Kings generally) Azariah (&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;); cf. on the use of the two names, the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>, instead of the standing formula, "only the high places were not removed," etc.) Kings), Uzziah's attitude towards the Lord is more exactly defined thus: "He was seeking God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God; and in the days when he sought Jahve, God gave him success." In &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; the infinitive with &#1500; is subordinated to &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, to express the duration of his seeking, for which the participle is elsewhere used. Nothing further is known of the Zechariah here mentioned: the commentators hold him to have been an important prophet; for had he been a priest, or the high priest, probably &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; would have been used. The reading &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (Keth.) is surprising. &#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489; can only denote, who had insight into (or understanding for the) seeing of God; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>. But Kimchi's idea, which other old commentators share, that this is a periphrasis to denote the prophetic endowment or activity of the man, is opposed by this, that "the seeing of God" which was granted to the elders of Israel at the making of the covenant, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>, cannot be regarded as a thing within the sphere of human action or practice, while the prophetic beholding in vision is essentially different from the seeing of God, and is, moreover, never so called. &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; would therefore seem to be an orthographical error for &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;, some MSS having &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; (cf. de Rossi, variae lectt.); and the lxx, Syr., Targ., Arab., Raschi, Kimchi, and others giving the reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, who was a teacher (instructor) in the fear of God, in favour of which also Vitringa, proll. in Jes. p. 4, has decided. </body></html>
