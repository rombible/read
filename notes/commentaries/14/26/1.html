Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable.

It has been supposed that this king is mentioned under the name of Az-ri-ja-a-u (i.e. “Azariah”) on an injured and obscure inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III. (reigned 745–727 b.c.) of Assyria, but the identification is doubtful. The two forms of the name when written in Heb. consonants closely resemble each other; the meanings moreover of the two are similar, “Jah is my strength” and “Jah hath given help.” Most likely the king bore both names; cp. “Abram” and “Abraham”—“Eliakim and Jehoiakim” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim.

It is probable that Azariah was the first-used name, that the latter name was not a corruption of the former, but that, for whatever reason, the king was called by both names. Nevertheless, the apt analogy that has been pointed out of Uzziel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>) and Azareel (18) is noteworthy. (See Keil and Bertheau on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>; and Keil on our present passage.) <span class="cmt_word">Sixteen years old</span>. Therefore Uzziah must have been born just before the fatal outside mistake of his father's life in the challenge he sent to Joash of Israel, and after the deadly inner mistake of his soul in turning aside to "the gods of the children of Seir." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The war with Joash, king of Israel. - Instead of following the counsel of the prophet, Amaziah consulted (sc., with his public officials or courtiers), and challenged King Joash of Israel to war.
