The chronicler has added the explanatory words: “belonging to the priests and to the Levites.” This can hardly be harmonised with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/12-4.htm" title="And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passes the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,">2Kings 12:4-12</a> - The chronicler may have misunderstood the words, which in the older account designate the royal guard; and it might have appeared to him impossible that any but members of the sacred orders would be called together <span class= "ital">in the Temple</span> by the high priest. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/23-5.htm" title="And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 23:5-6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm" title="And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.">2Kings 11:4</a> : “brought them <span class= "ital">into</span> <span class= "ital">the house of the Lord.”</span>) But he may also have had before him an account in which the part taken by the sacerdotal caste in the revolution was made much more of than m the account of Kings. Moreover the priests and Levites would be likely to play a considerable part in a movement tending to the overthrow of a <span class= "ital">cultus</span> antagonistic to their own, especially when that movement originated with their own spiritual head, and was transacted in the sanctuary to which they were attached. The chronicler, therefore, cannot with fairness be accused of “arbitrary alterations,” unless it be presupposed that his <span class= "ital">sole</span> authority in writing this account was the Second Book of Kings. The priests and Levites used to do duty in the Temple from Sabbath to Sabbath, so that one course relieved another at the end of each week. (See 1 Chronicles 24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-5.htm" title="THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.">Luke 1:5</a>.) That the companies of the royal guards succeeded each other on duty in the same fashion is clear from the parallel narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be porters of the doors.</span>—<span class= "ital">Warders of the thresholds,</span> that is, of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-19.htm" title="And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.">1Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm" title="All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve.

The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The writer of Chronicles relates the orders that were given to the Levites, the author of Kings those received by the royal body-guard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-9.

From Kings it appears that it was the custom on the Sabbath for two-thirds of the royal guards to be free and for one-third to be on duty at the palace. In order to avoid arousing suspicion this last third was, according to Jehoiada’s directions, to be at the palace as usual, but it was to be subdivided into thirds and so distributed as to close the various means of communication between the palace and the rest of the city. Thus Athaliah was to be held as in a trap by her own guards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/11-5.htm" title="And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;...">2 Kings 11:5-6</a>). The two-thirds who were free from duty on the Sabbath were to be stationed in the Temple about the young king to guard him at his coronation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The arrangements are differently (and no doubt less accurately) stated in Chron. In the first place Levitical Temple guards take the place of the royal guards, secondly, the only division of the guards recognised is a simple division into thirds, finally, the stations of the different divisions are differently given, viz., one-third in the Temple, one-third in the palace, and one-third at “the gate of the foundation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Using the modern terms “battalion” and “company” for the divisions and subdivisions given in Kings, the arrangements may be stated in a form which allows easy comparison between Kings and Chron., as fallows:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(A) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/11-5.htm" title="And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;...">2 Kings 11:5-7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(Royal guards in three battalions.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1st battalion on duty at the king’s house (palace).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A company within the palace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-5.htm" title="And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 23:5</a>),<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>B company at the gate of Sur (<span class="ital">SVR</span> Heb.),<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>C company at another gate (“behind the guard,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-6.htm" title="But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2nd and 3rd battalions off duty, but brought into the house of the Lord (the Temple) by Jehoiada (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-7.htm" title="And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever else comes into the house, he shall be put to death: but be you with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.">2 Chronicles 23:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(B) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;...">2 Chronicles 23:4-5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(Levites in three bands.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Band I. (= 1st battalion C company of 2 Kin.) in the house of God, the Chronicler supposing that “the house” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-6.htm" title="And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.">2 Kings 11:6</a>) means the house of the Lord. More probably it means “the house of the king” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm" title="And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;">2 Kings 11:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Band II.

(= 1st battalion B company of 2 Kin.) at the gate of “the foundation” (<span class="ital">JSVD</span> Heb.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(The Chronicler passes over the 2nd and 3rd battalions, because he has already assigned their duty to 1st battalion C company.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the priests and of the Levites</span>] Not in Kings. The words are a mistaken gloss of the Chronicler, for it is clear that in Kings <span class="ital">lay</span> guards are meant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">porters of the doors</span>] R.V. mg., <span class="bld">of the thresholds</span>, i.e. of the Temple acc. to the Chronicler, for the word for “doors” (or “thresholds,” <span class="ital">sippim</span> in Heb.) is always used for the thresholds of some <span class="ital">sanctuary</span>, e.g. of the Tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-19.htm" title="And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-22.htm" title="All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve.

In the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-6.htm" title="And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.">2 Kings 11:6</a>) however “the watch of the house” clearly means “the watch of the king’s house” (<span class="ital">ibid.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm" title="And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;">2 Kings 11:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">a third</span> part shall be <span class="ital">at the king’s house; and a third</span> part <span class="ital">at the gate of the foundation</span>] These two-thirds according to the scheme given above were both stationed about the palace, but they are <span class="ital">not</span> to be reckoned as two-thirds of <span class="ital">the whole guard</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the gate of the foundation</span>] “Gate of <span class="ital">JSVD</span>” (Heb.).

Probably however we should read “Gate of <span class="ital">SVS</span> (or <span class="ital">SVSIM</span>),” i.e. “Horse Gate” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-15.htm" title="So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.">2 Chronicles 23:15</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-16.htm" title="And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.">2 Kings 11:16</a>) both here and in Kings.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The first thing that is to be observed is the distinct and repeated mention of the <span class="accented">Levites</span>, as those on whom the critical and onerous service that came of Jehoiada's resolution was devolved, while the parallel does not so much as mention them. It may next be noted that our first and second verses state the part that "the captains of hundreds" were called to perform in <span class="accented">collecting</span> the requisite number of Levites from the provincial cities of Judah. And once more it may be noted that whereas, while we abide close by our own text alone, nothing in the description of our vers. 4-10 occasions material difficulty, even when the perplexity, which is considerable, does enter, on consulting and endeavouring to reconcile the parallel, it is with extreme probability due to our not making sufficient allowance for the fact that the matter of the two accounts does not so much offer itself for reconciliation as for concurrent acceptance. We have now to follow the description of our own text. <span class="cmt_word">Of you entering on the sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of you who enter on your period of duty on such a sabbath.
