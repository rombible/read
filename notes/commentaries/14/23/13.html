The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At the entering in - i. e. at, or near, the opening from the main chamber of the temple into the holy of holies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in&#8212;The king's pillar was in the people's court, opposite that of the priests'.

A contradiction arises only if we misinterpret &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;, and understand it of the forming of a circle around the king; whereas &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;, like &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; (Kings), is to be understood, according to the context, of the setting of the guards both at the temple gate and in the courts, so that whoever entered the court of the temple came within the ranks of the guards thus placed. </body></html>
