Apparently it is merely an emphatic repetition of the direction of the last verse that all the people were to remain in the courts, and not to break the law by presuming to enter the holy chambers. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm" title="And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.">2Kings 11:7</a> we read instead: “And the two parts among you, all that go out on the Sabbath, they <span class= "ital">shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord,</span> with regard to the king.” The last words of the present verse, “And all the people <span class= "ital">shall keep the watch of the Lord”</span> repeat a portion of this, but in a different sense: “Let all the people carefully observe the legal rule against entering the sanctuary.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-6.htm" title="But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 23:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let none come into the house of the Lord </span>— Strictly so called, and distinguished from the courts just mentioned, namely, into the sanctuary, or holy place. <span class="ital">Save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites — </span>Who are to minister in course, or according to my present appointment. <span class="ital">They shall go in, for they are holy — </span>They have been consecrated to the service of God, and are bound to attend there. <span class="ital">But all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord — </span>That is, of <span class="ital">the house </span>of the Lord, as is expressed <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-6.htm" title="And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.">2 Kings 11:6</a>.

The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Keep the watch of the Lord - i. e. guard against any attempt that might be made by the Baal-worshippers to force their way through the courts into the temple. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-9.

Through this little chink we get some light confirmatory of the concurrent jurisdiction of the account in the parallel The express caution of this clause shows that there were others about, and others officiating, beside the Levites, who only have been mentioned hitherto in our text, except under the most generic designation (as before, so again in last clause of this verse) of "all the people." The last clause of this verse may cover the contents of ver. 7 in the parallel. The distinction between "the courts of the house of the Lord" (ver. 5), and "the house of the Lord" (ver. 6) is, of course, quite apparent. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The six years' tyranny of Athaliah. - In regard to her, all that is stated is, that after Ahaziah's death she ascended the throne, and caused all the royal seed of the house of Judah, i.e., all the male members of the royal house, to be murdered. From this slaughter only Joash the son of Ahaziah, an infant a year old, was rescued, together with his nurse, by the princess Jehoshabeath, who was married to the high priest Jehoiada. He was hidden for six years, and during that time Athaliah reigned.
