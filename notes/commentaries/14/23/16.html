But the two passages do not contradict each other. For Jehoiada, as God’s priest, was his representative in this transaction, or a sort of mediator, as Moses was. God covenanted by him to take them for his people; and the king and people covenanted with him to be his; and then the king covenanted with the people to govern them <span class="ital">as the people of God; </span>and the people with the king, to be subject to him <span class="ital">as the Lord’s people, </span>in his fear, and for his sake. For it must be observed, that this covenant, and others made in like manner, were solemn promises on the part of the Jewish king and people, that, for the future, they would observe God’s laws: in return to which the high-priest promised, on the part of God, that, if they did so, they should enjoy all the blessings promised in those divine laws to obedience.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Between him ... - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a> the covenant is said to have been made "between the Lord," etc. To the writer of Chronicles Jehoiada was God's representative, and received the pledges of king and people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 23:16.
