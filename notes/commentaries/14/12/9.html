It is very common, but very lamentable, that men, who in distress or danger, or near death, seem much engaged in seeking and serving God, throw aside all their religion when they have received a merciful deliverance. God quickly brought troubles upon Judah, to awaken the people to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. Thus it becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of Providence, to justify God, and to judge ourselves. If we have humbled hearts under humbling providences, the affliction has done its work; it shall be removed, or the property of it be altered. The more God's service is compared with other services, the more reasonable and easy it will appear. Are the laws of temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will be found much harder. The service of God is perfect liberty; the service of our lusts is complete slavery. Rehoboam was never rightly fixed in his religion. He never quite cast off God; yet he engaged not his heart to seek the Lord. See what his fault was; he did not serve the Lord, because he did not seek the Lord. He did not pray, as Solomon, for wisdom and grace; he did not consult the word of God, did not seek to that as his oracle, nor follow its directions. He made nothing of his religion, because he did not set his heart to it, nor ever came up to a steady resolution in it. He did evil, because he never was determined for good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they may know my service, and the service of the kingdom - i. e., that they may contrast the light burthen of the theocracy with the heavy yoke of a foreign monarch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. So Shishak &#8230; came up against Jerusalem&#8212;After the parenthetical clause (2Ch 12:5-8) describing the feelings and state of the beleaguered court, the historian resumes his narrative of the attack upon Jerusalem, and the consequent pillage both of the temple and the palace.<p>he took all&#8212;that is, everything valuable he found. The cost of the targets and shields has been estimated at about &pound;239,000 [Napier, Ancient Workers in Metal].<p>the shields of gold&#8212;made by Solomon, were kept in the house of the forest of Lebanon (2Ch 9:16). They seem to have been borne, like maces, by the guards of the palace, when they attended the king to the temple or on other public processions. Those splendid insignia having been plundered by the Egyptian conqueror, others were made of inferior metal and kept in the guard room of the palace, to be ready for use; as, notwithstanding the tarnished glory of the court, the old state etiquette was kept up on public and solemn occasions. An account of this conquest of Judah, with the name of "king of Judah" in the cartouche of the principal captive, according to the interpreters, is carved and written in hieroglyphics on the walls of the great palace of Karnak, where it may be seen at the present day. This sculpture is about twenty-seven hundred years old, and is of peculiar interest as a striking testimony from Egypt to the truth of Scripture history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Upon which condition, and Rehoboam’s submission to him, he delivered up to him the fenced cities of Judah, which he had taken, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-4.htm" title="And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 12:4</a></span>.

This hostile invasion is also briefly narrated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-28</a>. Shishak (Sisak) is, as we have remarked on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14.htm">1 Kings 14</a>, Sesonchis or Sechonchosis, the first king of the 22nd dynasty, who has celebrated his victory in a relief at Karnak. In this sculpture the names of the cities captured are recorded on shields, and a considerable number have been deciphered with some certainty, and by them our account is completely confirmed. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>, Shishak's host consisted of 1200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen-numbers which, of course, are founded only upon a rough estimate-and an innumerable multitude of footmen, among whom were &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, Libyans, probably the Libyaegyptii of the ancients (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a>); &#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, according to the lxx and Vulg. Troglodytes, probably the Ethiopian Troglodytes, who dwelt in the mountains on the west coast of the Arabian Gulf; and Cushites, i.e., Ethiopians. The Libyans and Cushites are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a> also as auxiliaries of the Egyptians. </body></html>
