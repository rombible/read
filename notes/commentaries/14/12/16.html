It is very common, but very lamentable, that men, who in distress or danger, or near death, seem much engaged in seeking and serving God, throw aside all their religion when they have received a merciful deliverance. God quickly brought troubles upon Judah, to awaken the people to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. Thus it becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of Providence, to justify God, and to judge ourselves. If we have humbled hearts under humbling providences, the affliction has done its work; it shall be removed, or the property of it be altered. The more God's service is compared with other services, the more reasonable and easy it will appear. Are the laws of temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will be found much harder. The service of God is perfect liberty; the service of our lusts is complete slavery. Rehoboam was never rightly fixed in his religion. He never quite cast off God; yet he engaged not his heart to seek the Lord. See what his fault was; he did not serve the Lord, because he did not seek the Lord. He did not pray, as Solomon, for wisdom and grace; he did not consult the word of God, did not seek to that as his oracle, nor follow its directions. He made nothing of his religion, because he did not set his heart to it, nor ever came up to a steady resolution in it. He did evil, because he never was determined for good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He prepared not his heart ... - See the margin.

His Reign and Death.<p>13, 14. Rehoboam strengthened &#8230; and reigned&#8212;The Egyptian invasion had been a mere predatory expedition, not extending beyond the limits of Judah, and probably, ere long, repelled by the invaded. Rehoboam's government acquired new life and vigor by the general revival of true religion, and his reign continued many years after the departure of Shishak. But<p>he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord&#8212;that is, he did not adhere firmly to the good course of reformation he had begun, "and he did evil," for through the unhappy influence of his mother, a heathen foreigner, he had no doubt received in his youth a strong bias towards idolatry (see on [434]1Ki 14:21).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the acts of Rehoboam,....

Here was the bury-lug-place of the kings, chambers with recesses for the successive kings. To this place of royal sepulture some of the kings were not permitted to be brought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-27.htm">2 Chronicles 28:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-7.htm">2 Kings 15:7</a>). The chief cemetery of the city was on the slopes of the valley of the Kidron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-5.htm">2 Chronicles 29:5, 16</a>); another, probably, was south of the city on the sides of the ravine of Hinnom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32</a>). In the king's sepulchres eleven out of Judah's twenty-two kings were laid - David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Ahaziah, Amaziah, Jotham, Hezekiah, Josiah. For Asa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>) places of special honour were found. The good priest Jehoiada also had burial in the king's burial-place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-16.htm">2 Chronicles 24:16</a>). Kings Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>) and Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>) were buried in the "city of David," but not in the above sepulchres Uzziah, because a leper, was buried in the "field of the burial of the kings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-23.htm">2 Chronicles 26:23</a>). It is all but certain that these royal sepulchres were in the enclosure now called the "Haram area." (For other interesting and important references, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-20.htm">2 Chronicles 33:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-27.htm">2 Chronicles 28:27</a>.) While Rehoboam was laid thus to sleep with his fathers, Jeroboam's reign had yet four years to run. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-9.htm">2 Chronicles 12:9</a> the account of the war is taken up again and continued by the repetition of the words, "Then marched Shishak ... against Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-4.htm">2 Chronicles 12:4</a>). Shishak plundered the treasures of the temple and the palace; he had consequently captured Jerusalem. The golden shields also which had been placed in the house of the forest of Lebanon, i.e., the palace built by Solomon in Jerusalem, which Solomon had caused to be made (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a>), Shishak took away, and in their place Rehoboam caused brazen shields to be prepared; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26-28</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-12.htm">2 Chronicles 12:12</a> the author of the Chronicle concludes the account of this event with the didactic remark, "Because he (Rehoboam) humbled himself, the anger of Jahve was turned away from him." &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, and it was not to extermination utterly (&#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, properly to destruction, i.e., completely; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-13.htm">Ezekiel 13:13</a>). And also in Judah were good things. This is the other motive which caused the Lord to turn away His wrath. Good things are proofs of piety and fear of God, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>. </body></html>
