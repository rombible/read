It is very common, but very lamentable, that men, who in distress or danger, or near death, seem much engaged in seeking and serving God, throw aside all their religion when they have received a merciful deliverance. God quickly brought troubles upon Judah, to awaken the people to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. Thus it becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of Providence, to justify God, and to judge ourselves. If we have humbled hearts under humbling providences, the affliction has done its work; it shall be removed, or the property of it be altered. The more God's service is compared with other services, the more reasonable and easy it will appear. Are the laws of temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will be found much harder. The service of God is perfect liberty; the service of our lusts is complete slavery. Rehoboam was never rightly fixed in his religion. He never quite cast off God; yet he engaged not his heart to seek the Lord. See what his fault was; he did not serve the Lord, because he did not seek the Lord. He did not pray, as Solomon, for wisdom and grace; he did not consult the word of God, did not seek to that as his oracle, nor follow its directions. He made nothing of his religion, because he did not set his heart to it, nor ever came up to a steady resolution in it. He did evil, because he never was determined for good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>twelve hundred chariots - This number is not unusnal (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). Benhadad brought 1,200 chariots into the field against Shalmaneser II; and Ahabhad at the same time a force of 2,000 chariots (compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a> note).<p>The Lubims or "Libyans" <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-43.htm">Daniel 11:43</a>, were a people of Africa, distinct from the Egyptians and the Ethiopians dwelling in their immediate neighborhood. They were called Ribu or Libu by the Egyptians. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a>.<p>Sukkiims - This name does not occur elsewhere. The Septuagint, who rendered the word "Troglodytes," regarded the Sukkiim probably as the "cave-dwellers" along the western shore of the Red Sea; but the conjecture that the word means "tent-dwellers" is plausible, and would point rather to a tribe of Arahs (Scenitae). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5. the Lubims&#8212;the Libyans of northeastern Africa.<p>the Sukkiims&#8212;Some think these were the Kenite Arabs, dwellers in tents, but others maintain more justly that these were Arab troglodytes, who inhabited the caverns of a mountain range on the western coast of the Red Sea.<p>and the Ethiopians&#8212;from the regions south of Egypt. By the overwhelming force of numbers, they took the fortresses of Judah which had been recently put in a state of defense, and marched to lay siege to the capital. While Shishak and his army was before Jerusalem, the prophet Shemaiah addressed Rehoboam and the princes, tracing this calamity to the national apostasy and threatening them with utter destruction in consequence of having forsaken God (2Ch 12:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lubims; </span> a people of Africa bordering upon Egypt; of whom <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-8.htm" title="Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because you did rely on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand.">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>"</span>; <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-43.htm" title="But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.">Daniel 11:43</a>"</span>; <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm" title="Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were your helpers.">Nahum 3:9</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Sukkiims; </span> a people living in tents, as the word signifies; and such there were not far from Egypt, both in Africa and in Arabia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Ethiopians; </span> either those beyond Egypt, or the Arabians. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen; and the people were without number,....

The letter <span class="accented">s</span> is orthographically redundant in this, as also in the following names, the forms being already plural. The <span class="accented">Lubim</span> mean the Libyans, west of Egypt.
