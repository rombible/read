Public ordinances should stir us up to cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The country priests and Levites are here distinguished from those who dwelt in the towns.

By the brethren in their courses we are to understand not merely the Levites dwelling in the priests' cities, who on account of their youth or old age could not come into the temple, but also those who at the time were not on duty, since the Levites' courses performed it by turns, only some courses being on duty in the temple, while the others were at home in the priests' cities. The object to &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-15.htm">2 Chronicles 31:15</a>, is not to be taken straightway from the objects mentioned with &#1500;&#1514;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-14.htm">2 Chronicles 31:14</a>. For the most holy gifts could not be sent to the priests' cities, but were consumed in the holy place, i.e., in the temple. Nor can we confine &#1500;&#1514;&#1514; to the &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;; for since the gifts of the people, laid up in the cells, consisted in first-fruits, tithes, and consecrated gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11</a>), and special officers were appointed for the storing and distribution of them, the business of distribution could not consist merely in the giving out of freewill offerings, but must have extended to all the offerings of the people. When, therefore, it is said of the Levite Kore, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-14.htm">2 Chronicles 31:14</a>, that he was appointed over the freewill offerings, to distribute the heave-offerings and the most holy, only his chief function is there mentioned, and the functions of the officials associated with and subordinated to him in the priests' cities are not to be confined to that. The object to &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-15.htm">2 Chronicles 31:15</a>, is consequently to be determined by the whole context, and the arrangements which are assumed as known from the law; i.e., we must embrace under that word the distribution of the first-fruits, tithes, and consecrated gifts, of which the Levites in the priests' cities were to receive their portion according to the law. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-16.htm">2 Chronicles 31:16</a>, the b&#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-15.htm">2 Chronicles 31:15</a> is more closely defined by an exception: "Besides their catalogue of the men (i.e., exclusive of those of the male sex catalogued by them) from three years old and upward, namely, of all those who came into the house of Jahve to the daily portion, for their service in their offices according to their courses." &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; signifies, in this connection, the portion of the holy gifts coming to them for every day; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-23.htm">Nehemiah 11:23</a>. The meaning of the verse is: From those dwelling in the priests' cities were excluded those who had come to perform service in the temple; and, indeed, not merely those performing the service, but also their male children, who were catalogued along with them if they were three years old and upward. Thence it is clear that those entering upon their service took their sons with them when they were three years old. These children ate in the place of the sanctuary of the portion coming to their parents.</body></html>
