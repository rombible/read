Public ordinances should stir us up to cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jerusalem had been cleansed <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-14.htm">2 Chronicles 30:14</a>; now the land had to be purged. Hezekiah therefore gave his sanction to a popular movement directed as much against the "high places" which had been maintained since the times of the patriarchs, as against the remnants of the Baal-worship, or the innovations of Ahaz. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a> note. The invasion of the northern kingdom "Ephraim and Manasseh" by a tumultuous crowd from the southern one, and the success which attended the movement, can only be explained by the state of weakness into which the northern kingdom had fallen (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-24.htm">2 Chronicles 29:24</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 31<p>2Ch 31:1-10. The People Forward in Destroying Idolatry.<p>1. all Israel &#8230; present went out to the cities of Judah&#8212;The solemnities of this paschal season left a deep and salutary impression on the minds of the assembled worshippers; attachment to the ancient institutions of their country was extensively revived; ardor in the service of God animated every bosom; and under the impulse of the devout feelings inspired by the occasion, they took measures at the close of the passover for extirpating idolatrous statues and altars out of every city, as at the beginning of the festival they had done in Jerusalem.<p>Judah and Benjamin&#8212;denote the southern kingdom.<p>Ephraim also and Manasseh&#8212;refer to the northern kingdom. This unsparing demolition of the monuments of idolatry would receive all encouragement from the king and public authorities of the former; and the force of the popular movement was sufficient to effect the same results among the tribes of Israel, whatever opposition the power of Hoshea or the invectives of some profane brethren might have made. Thus the reign of idolatry being completely overthrown and the pure worship of God re-established throughout the land, the people returned every one to his own home, in the confident expectation that, through the divine blessing, they would enjoy a happy future of national peace and prosperity.The people forward in destroying idolatry: Hezekiah ordereth the courses of the priests and Levites; and provideth for their work and maintenance, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/31-1.htm" title="Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all.

In the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. For although these were a part of Hoshea’s kingdom, yet Hezekiah presumed to do this, partly, by virtue of the law of God, to which both Israel and Judah owed subjection, which commanded the extirpation of these things out of the whole land of Canaan; partly, by the special impulse and direction of God’s Spirit, which sometimes did put persons upon heroical and extraordinary actions, not to be drawn into imitation; and partly, because he knew that Hoshea contented himself with the worship of the calves, and did not practise that great idolatry which his predecessors had used, and therefore would patiently suffer the breaking of these images of Baal, and the things belonging to them; which is all that was done at this time. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now when all this was finished,....
