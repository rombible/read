Children, it appears, were allowed to accompany their fathers to the Temple, and to eat with them of the sacrifices.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-16.htm" title="Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even to every one that enters into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;">2 Chronicles 31:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">From three years old and upward — </span>To whom a portion of these things was allotted, as is here implied. <span class="ital">Unto every one that entereth into the house of the Lord — </span>That were capable of entering thither and doing service there, which they were at twenty years old, as is expressed here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm" title="Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;">2 Chronicles 31:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-24.htm" title="These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>, through the whole company of the priests and Levites.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:1-21 Hezekiah destroys idolatry. - After the passover, the people of Israel applied with vigour to destroy the monuments of idolatry. Public ordinances should stir us up to cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beside their genealogy of males ... - Some translate it: "Excepting the list of males," etc. i. e. they distributed to all the members of the priestly families, excepting to those who at the time were performing the duties of their office at Jerusalem.

Hezekiah Appoints Officers to Dispose of the Tithes.<p>11-18. Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord&#8212;storehouses, granaries, or cellars; either the old ones, which had been allowed through neglect to fall into decay, were to be repaired, or additional ones built. Private individuals brought their own first-fruits to the temple; but the tithes were levied by the Levites, who kept a faithful account of them in their several places of abode and transmitted the allotted proportion to the priests. Officers were appointed to distribute equal rations to all in the cities of the priests who, from age or other reasons, could not repair to the temple. With the exception of children under three years of age&#8212;an exception made probably from their being considered too young to receive solid food&#8212;lists were kept of the number and age of every male; of priests according to their fathers' house, and Levites from twenty years (see Nu 4:3; 28:24; 1Ch 23:24).

Their office was not only to give to the priests, but to those of their males in their genealogy, who were three years old and upwards; for under that age, according to Kimchi, they were not fit to come into the temple; nor have they knowledge to keep what is put into their hands; nor fit to handle offerings, lest they should defile them; but at that age they might be taught how to hold them, and be used to it; but as for females, he says, they were not admitted at any age: <p>even unto everyone that entereth into the house of the Lord; of the said age, and in the genealogy and register of the priests: <p>his daily portion for their service in their charges, according to their courses; food for every day, in consideration of their service in their several wards, according to their courses in turn. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Beside their genealogy of males, <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> from three years old and upward, <i>even</i> unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;</span><p>(k) Who had also a portion and allowance in this distribution.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">beside their genealogy of males</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">beside them that were reckoned by genealogy of males</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>even <span class="ital">unto every one that entereth</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">even every one that entered</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>his <span class="ital">daily portion</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">as the duty of every day required</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beside their</span> <span class="cmt_word">genealogy of males</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> except (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) the family count of males, etc., the remainder of the verse describing those who are meant by the <span class="accented">excepted.</span> They were excepted because for themselves and their little ones, their daily present temple service brought their daily maintenance as of course. The "unto every one" of our version is misleading. Keil translates perspicuously, "of all those who entered the house of the Lord, to the daily portion for their service," etc. The glimpse of the picture of the little children fed for the sake of their fathers' sanctuary service, so true to the true religion even of nature, is a pleasant glimpse to catch. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Hezekiah and the priests saw these heaps, they praised the Lord and His people Israel.<p>The employment and storing of these gifts, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-9.htm">2 Chronicles 31:9-19</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-9.htm">2 Chronicles 31:9</a>.
