Public ordinances should stir us up to cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin, and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same. The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatest importance to personal, family, and public religion. When they had tasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they were free in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit of a settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all that Hezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in his aim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have few or many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, and encourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincere regard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfort at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If this Azariah was the same as he who resisted Uzziah <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17-20</a>, he must have held his office at least 33 years.

Hezekiah Appoints Officers to Dispose of the Tithes.<p>11-18. Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord&#8212;storehouses, granaries, or cellars; either the old ones, which had been allowed through neglect to fall into decay, were to be repaired, or additional ones built. Private individuals brought their own first-fruits to the temple; but the tithes were levied by the Levites, who kept a faithful account of them in their several places of abode and transmitted the allotted proportion to the priests. Officers were appointed to distribute equal rations to all in the cities of the priests who, from age or other reasons, could not repair to the temple. With the exception of children under three years of age&#8212;an exception made probably from their being considered too young to receive solid food&#8212;lists were kept of the number and age of every male; of priests according to their fathers' house, and Levites from twenty years (see Nu 4:3; 28:24; 1Ch 23:24). But, besides, provision was also made for their wives, daughters, and servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the house of the Lord; </span> largely so called, to wit, in the courts, or in the chambers adjoining to the house. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord,....

Proceeding upon the assumption that all &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; which were consecrated to Jahve were given over to the tribe of Levi, Bertheau finds no correspondence between the law and the statement of our verse, that the tenth of the holy things was given, and points out that the lxx seem to have read &#1493;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1494; instead of &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; m`sr, without, however, himself deciding in favour of that reading. But the lxx have rendered the words hmqdsym &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, and consequently cannot have read &#1493;&#1506;&#1494; for &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, since in their translation epide'kata corresponds to m`sr. But the deviation of the statement in our verse from the law, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>, arises partly from an incorrect or inexact interpretation of the provisions of the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>. In the law, &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; as such were not assigned to the tribe of Levi, or more correctly to the priests (Aaron and his sons), but only the &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the heave-offerings of all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, i.e., the pieces or parts of the sacrificial gifts of the Israelites which were not burnt upon the altar, consequently the greater part of the meal, and oil, and flesh of the oblations, the sin-offerings, the trespass-offerings, and of the peace-offerings, the wave-breast and wave-thigh, and whatever else was waved in wave-offerings; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>. These Therumoth of the consecrated gifts are in our verse designated &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, because they were only a fragment of that which was consecrated to the Lord, just as the tenth was a fragment of the whole herd, and of the field produce. The statement of our verse, therefore, differs only in expression from the prescription of the law, but in substance it completely agrees with it. &#1506;&#1512; &#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, and they made many heaps, i.e., they brought the first-fruits and tithes in heaps.</body></html>
