The brook which flowed through the midst of the land is the Gihon, which was formed by the waters flowing from the springs, and was dried up by these springs being covered and the water diverted. For further information, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>. The object of this measure is stated in the words which follow: Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water? i.e., why should we provide them with much water, when they advance against the city and besiege it? The plural, kings of Assyria, is rhetorical, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-16.htm">2 Chronicles 28:16</a>.</body></html>
