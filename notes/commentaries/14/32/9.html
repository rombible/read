The capture of Lachish by Sennacherib and its spoliation are shewn on an Assyrian relief now in the British Museum.

On the other side, there is very little additional in our narrative, a few words heightening the effect in our vers. 18, 20, 21, constituting the whole of such additional matter. The vague mark of time, <span class="cmt_word">after this</span>, with which our present verse opens, merely says that in due course of Sennacherib's invasion of Judah, and attack of the fenced cities (ver. 1), he proceeds to send his servants and his insolent defiances to the metropolis, Jerusalem itself. The three words in italics, "himself <span class="accented">laid</span> "siege," should evidently give place to the single word "remained" or "was;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he and all his host with him remained at, or opposite to, Lachish, while his servants went to defy Jerusalem in his name. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Preparations of Hezekiah for the strengthening and defending of Jerusalem. - We find an account of this neither in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a> nor in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36</a>; but the fact is confirmed both by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8-11</a>, and by the remark <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a> of our chapter).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-2.htm">2 Chronicles 32:2-4</a><p>When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib advanced, and his face was to war against Jerusalem, i.e., that he purposed to capture Jerusalem, he consulted with his princes and his valiant men to cover the waters of the springs which were outside the city; and they helped him, brought much people together, and covered all the springs, and the brook which ran through the midst of the land. &#1505;&#1514;&#1501; does not denote to obstruct, but only to hide by covering and conducting the water into subterranean channels. The brook which flowed through the midst of the land is the Gihon, which was formed by the waters flowing from the springs, and was dried up by these springs being covered and the water diverted. For further information, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>. The object of this measure is stated in the words which follow: Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water? i.e., why should we provide them with much water, when they advance against the city and besiege it? The plural, kings of Assyria, is rhetorical, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-16.htm">2 Chronicles 28:16</a>.</body></html>
