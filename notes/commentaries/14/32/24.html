It is good for us to know ourselves, and our own weakness and sinfulness, that we may not be conceited, or self-confident, but may always live in dependence upon Divine grace. We know not the corruption of our own hearts, nor what we shall do if God leaves us to ourselves. His sin was, that his heart was lifted up. What need have great men, and good men, and useful men, to study their own infirmities and follies, and their obligations to free grace, that they may never think highly of themselves; but beg earnestly of God, that he will always keep them humble! Hezekiah made a bad return to God for his favours, by making even those favours the food and fuel of his pride. Let us shun the occasions of sin: let us avoid the company, the amusements, the books, yea, the very sights that may administer to sin. Let us commit ourselves continually to God's care and protection; and beg of him never to leave us nor forsake us. Blessed be God, death will soon end the believer's conflict; then pride and every sin will be abolished. He will no more be tempted to withhold the praise which belongs to the God of his salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20.htm">2 Kings 20</a> and notes.

"Who is there among all the gods of these peoples, whom my fathers utterly destroyed, who could have delivered his people out of my hand, that your God should save you?" The idea is, that since the gods of the other peoples, which were mightier than your God, have not been able to save their peoples, how should your God be in a position to rescue you from my power? This idea is again repeated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-15.htm">2 Chronicles 32:15</a>, as a foundation for the exhortation not to let themselves be deceived and misled by Hezekiah, and not to believe his words, and that in an assertative form: "for not one god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people, ... much less then (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1507;) your gods: they will not save you;" and this is done in order to emphasize strongly the blasphemy of the Assyrian generals against the Almighty God of Israel. To communicate more of these blasphemous speeches would in the chronicler's view be useless, and he therefore only remarks, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-16.htm">2 Chronicles 32:16</a>, "And yet more spake his (Sennacherib's) servants against God Jahve, and against His servant Hezekiah;" and then, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-17.htm">2 Chronicles 32:17</a>, that Sennacherib also wrote a letter of similar purport, and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-18.htm">2 Chronicles 32:18</a>) that his servants called with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem upon the wall, to throw them into fear and terrify them, that they might take the city. What they called to the people is not stated, but by the infinit. &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1501; &#1500;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1501; it is hinted, and thence we may gather that it was to the same effect as the blasphemous speeches above quoted (&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1501;, inf. Pi., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-19.htm">Nehemiah 6:19</a>). - On comparing <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a> and 19, it is clear that Sennacherib only sent the letter to Hezekiah after his general Rabshakeh had informed him of the fruitlessness of his efforts to induce the people of Jerusalem to submit by speeches, and the news of the advance of the Cushite king Tirhakah had arrived; while the calling aloud in the Jews' language to the people standing on the wall, on the part of his generals, took place in the first negotiation with the ambassadors of Hezekiah. The author of the Chronicle has arranged his narrative rhetorically, so as to make the various events form a climax: first, the speeches of the servants of Sennacherib; then the king's letter to Hezekiah to induce him and his counsellors to submit; and finally, the attempt to terrify the people in language intelligible to them. The conclusion is the statement, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-19.htm">2 Chronicles 32:19</a> : "They spake of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of the hands of man;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>. </body></html>
