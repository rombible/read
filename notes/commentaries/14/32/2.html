The polluting or filling up of wells, and the altering of the course of rivers, is an old practice that still obtains in the wars of the East. Hezekiah's plan was to cover the fountain heads, so that they might not be discovered by the enemy, and to carry the water by subterranean channels or pipes into the city&#8212;a plan which, while it would secure a constant supply to the inhabitants, would distress the besiegers, as the country all around Jerusalem was very destitute of water.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come,....

Jerusalem</span>. Whether the three verses of ill omen already alluded to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>) may be road precedent to this verse, and purport that the bribes had <span class="accented">been paid</span>, and yet had failed of their object, so that Hezekiah was now compelled to brace himself to the occasion, and "took counsel," etc. (next verse); or whether this verse dates (as some think)the quailing heart of Hezekiah, and an <span class="accented">offer</span> or <span class="accented">part</span> payment of treasure by Hezekiah to Sennacherib, which only increased his insolence, as immediately now related, is uncertain, perhaps. In the face of the emphatic language of the three verses of the parallel, and in consideration of the possible motives as suggested above for our compiler omitting the matter altogether, we incline to the former opinion. That would have the effect of making this verse say that when Hezekiah had his eyes opened to the failure of his bribe - a waste payment, for that Sennacherib still "purposed to fight against Jerusalem" - he finally proceeded to take the right steps. However, the witness and indications of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2-4</a>, may go some way to shield Hezekiah from the entire blame. The silence of our compiler on the whole matter is the one residuum of fact, and unfortunate in its suggestion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm">2 Chronicles 31:17</a> contains a parenthetic remark as to the catalogues. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;, as nota accus., serves here to emphasize the statement which is added as an elucidation (cf. Ew. 277, d): "But concerning the catalogue of the priests, it was (taken, prepared) according to the fathers'-houses; and the Levites, they were from twenty years old and upwards in their offices in their courses."
