And he built the whole wall which was broken, i.e., he strengthened it by building up the breaches and defective places; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9</a>. The words &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; are obscure, since the translation "he mounted on the towers" has no meaning. But if &#1497;&#1506;&#1500; be taken as a Hiph., "he caused to ascend upon the towers," the object is wanting; and if we supply walls, it is arbitrary, for we might just as well suppose it to be machines which he caused to be carried to the top of the towers for defence against the enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>). The lxx have wholly omitted the words, and the translation of the Vulg., et exstruxit turres desuper, appears to be only a guess, but is yet perhaps correct, and presupposes the reading &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, "and brought up upon it towers," in favour of which Ewald also decides. This conjecture is in any case simpler than Bertheau's, that &#1506;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500; is a false transcription of &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;: "he built the whole wall, and towers upon it, and outside was the other wall," and is therefore to be preferred to it. The "other wall" enclosed the lower city (Acra). This, too, was not first built by Hezekiah; he only fortified it anew, for <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a> already speaks of two walls, between which a body of water had been introduced: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>. He fortified also the Millo of the city of David (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>), and supplied the fortifications with weapons (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, a weapon of defence; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-8.htm">Joel 2:8</a>) in multitude, and with shields; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-14.htm">2 Chronicles 26:14</a>.</body></html>
