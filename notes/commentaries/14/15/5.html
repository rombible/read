He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Israel" here is used generally for the whole people of God; and the reference is especially to the many apostasies in the days of the Judges, which were followed by repentance and deliverance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-6. Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, &c.&#8212;Some think that Azariah was referring to the sad and disastrous condition to which superstition and idolatry had brought the neighboring kingdom of Israel. His words should rather be taken in a wider sense, for it seems manifest that the prophet had his eye upon many periods in the national history, when the people were in the state described&#8212;a state of spiritual destitution and ignorance&#8212;and exhibited its natural result as widespread anarchy, mutual dissension among the tribes, and general suffering (Jud 9:23; 12:4; 20:21; 2Ch 13:17). These calamities God permitted to befall them as the punishment of their apostasy. Azariah's object in these remarks was to establish the truth of his counsel (2Ch 15:2), threatening, in case of neglecting it by describing the uniform course of the divine procedure towards Israel, as shown in all periods of their history. Then after this appeal to national experience, he concluded with an earnest exhortation to the king to prosecute the work of reformation so well begun [2Ch 15:7].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In those times; </span> when Israel lived in the gross neglect and contempt of God, and his law and worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">No peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; </span> men could not go abroad about their private occasions without great danger; as it was in the days of Shamgar, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm" title="In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.">Judges 5:6</a></span>, which is a good comment upon this text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the countries, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">of these countries</span>, i.e. the divers parts of the land of Israel, both within and without Jordan. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in,....
