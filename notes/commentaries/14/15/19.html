Thenius suggests that the letter <span class= "ital">l,</span> denoting 30, got into the text originally, through some transcriber, who inadvertently wrote the <span class= "ital">l</span> with which the next Hebrew word begins twice over. Later on, some other copyist naturally corrected <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2Chronicles 16:1</a>, to agree with this. Assuming thus that the right readings here were originally <span class= "ital">the fifth</span> and <span class= "ital">sixth</span> years of the reign of Asa, Thenius concludes that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2Chronicles 16:1</a> the letter <span class= "ital">v </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> 6) has been shortened into <span class= "ital">y</span> (10); and that Baasha’s attempt preceded the invasion of Zerah.

He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner.

The parallel, after the identical words Of the previous verse already noted, goes on emphatically to speak of the fact that "there was war between Asa and Baasha all their days;" and the same statement is repeated in the thirty-second verse of the sa<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-16.htm">1 Kings 15:16, 32</a>).
