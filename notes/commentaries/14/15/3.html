In proof of this point he argues from facts, and observes, that in time past, when Israel forsook their duty, they were overrun with a deluge of atheism, impiety, irreligion, and all irregularities; and were continually embarrassed with vexations, and destructive wars, foreign and domestic. But when their troubles drove them to God, they found it not in vain to seek him. He seems to refer especially to the times of the judges. For then they were frequently, though not wholly and universally, yet in a very great measure, without God and his law, and teaching priests: and then, indeed, they were brought to suffer all the exigencies and calamities here mentioned. They were harassed by grievous wars, both foreign and domestic, and frequently oppressed by one enemy or other, as by the Moabites, Midianites, Ammonites, and other neighbouring nations, and were <span class="ital">vexed with all adversity, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-6.htm" title="And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.">2 Chronicles 15:6</a>; yet when, in their perplexity, they turned to God by repentance, prayer, and reformation, he raised up deliverers for them. Thus that maxim, that <span class="ital">God is with us, while we are with him, </span>was often verified in those times. This seems to be the most obvious sense of the passage, taking Israel for the whole nation, and not for the ten tribes merely, who had revolted under Jeroboam, to whom part of the prophet’s speech is not at all applicable; for it could not with truth be said of them, that <span class="ital">when they were in trouble they turned unto the Lord, and sought him, and he was found of them. </span>Some think, among whom is Houbigant, that the whole passage is prophetical, and looks forward to future times; and that it ought to be read in the future tense, thus: <span class="ital">Now, for a long season, Israel shall be without the true God,</span> &c. <span class="ital">But when, in their trouble, they shall turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and seek him, he will be found of them: </span>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>. But the former explication seems to be more agreeable, both to the Hebrew text, and to the context preceding and following, and to be much more suitable to the design of the prophet, as stated above.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-19 The people make a solemn covenant with God. - The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none.

Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, &c.&#8212;Some think that Azariah was referring to the sad and disastrous condition to which superstition and idolatry had brought the neighboring kingdom of Israel. His words should rather be taken in a wider sense, for it seems manifest that the prophet had his eye upon many periods in the national history, when the people were in the state described&#8212;a state of spiritual destitution and ignorance&#8212;and exhibited its natural result as widespread anarchy, mutual dissension among the tribes, and general suffering (Jud 9:23; 12:4; 20:21; 2Ch 13:17). These calamities God permitted to befall them as the punishment of their apostasy. Azariah's object in these remarks was to establish the truth of his counsel (2Ch 15:2), threatening, in case of neglecting it by describing the uniform course of the divine procedure towards Israel, as shown in all periods of their history. Then after this appeal to national experience, he concluded with an earnest exhortation to the king to prosecute the work of reformation so well begun [2Ch 15:7].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Heb. <span class="ital">For many days</span> have been to Israel <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">without the true God, </span>& c, i.e. they have long lived without the sound knowledge and worship of the true God. The prophet confirms his foregoing exhortation, and the threatening annexed to it, that if they forsook God, he would forsake them, from the usual manner of God’s dealing with Israel formerly, and therefore in the same case they may expect the same usage. <span class="ital">Israel</span>, here mentioned and propounded as an example, is here understood, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Specially of the ten tribes, distinguished by that name from the kingdom of Judah; whose condition had been, since Jeroboam’s revolt, and now was such in some measure, as is here described, they having been, and still being, without God and his true worship, and therefore exposed to many vexations, and wars, and miseries. But these had not as yet turned unto God, or sought him, nor was God yet found of them, as is said of this Israel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-4.htm" title="But when they in their trouble did turn to the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.">2 Chronicles 15:4</a></span>.

Generally of the whole nation of Israel in former times, and especially in the times of the judges; to which all that follows suits very well; for then many times they were, though not wholly and universally, yet in a very great measure, and for the generality of them, without God, and his law, and teaching priests, as plainly appears from divers passages in the Book of the Judges; and then indeed they were brought to all the exigencies and calamities here following; then they had grievous wars, both foreign and domestic; and then they did sometimes turn to the Lord and sought him, and he was found of them, and did raise up judges and saviours to them; of which see <span class="bld">Judges 2</span> at large, and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Judges 3:15</a> 10:10</span>, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God,....

Azariah’s own exhortation is continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-7.htm" title="Be you strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.">2 Chronicles 15:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">without a teaching priest, and without law</span>] The connexion between these two is closer than the English suggests. “Law” (Heb. <span class="ital">torah</span>) is properly “teaching, guidance.” A “teaching” (Heb. <span class="ital">moreh</span>) priest is one who gives “torah” or “guidance” on doubtful points of morality or ritual. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now for a long season</span>. This translation is wrong; translate rather first, <span class="accented">And many the days to Israel to not have true God, and to not have teaching priest, and to not have Law</span>. So far no tense is limited, however naturally through the very drift of the passage it may seem that <span class="accented">experience</span> is being challenged, and so necessarily the past tense desiderated, not, however, in <span class="accented">aorist</span> shape, but in what some French grammarians call present perfect. For Azariah may well contemplate his illustration as good from long of old, to the very moment he was speaking. The unfortunate wealth of illustration to hand of his position may pardon the doubtfulness of commentators as to the source from which it may be supposed he would have drawn his most effective instances. It will not be the unlikeliest guide to follow the triple description of the alleged apostasy, misfortune, or iniquity "of Israel," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> (say) it <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the true God</span>; <span class="accented">happened to</span> them <span class="cmt_word">to not have teaching priest</span>; <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the Law</span> (this meaning, to not have it authoritatively proclaimed, taught, ministered). When did these three things <span class="accented">happen</span> altogether most notoriously? They describe, not the transgressions of an individual king, but the state of the people and kingdom as a whole. If it were possible to conceive the description as a flagrant anachronism, a retrospective post-Captivity amplification, which the writer (in his glow of work and thought) was unconsciously and irresistibly betrayed into putting into the lips of the Prophet Azariah, all doubt would end; for the description would suit no state of things and no period better than that of the divided kingdoms, especially applying to the career of the separate kingdom of Israel. Our account, unfortunately, is unchecked just here by a parallel. It is, however, impossible to suppose this without any tittle of external authority for it, much less enough to proceed upon. Some so crave the illustration that they are prepared to suppose all the tenses of these verses present and future rather than past and "present perfect." But, in fact, no doubt the history of Israel since the death of Moses illustrated the language of Azariah <span class="accented">passim</span> to a degree beyond all "that is written" or that we know. And then we may certainly consider theft the expression chosen, "many days" (which some translate "many a day," "many a time "), even the word "years" not being employed, leaves it open to us to go to short episodes of an irreligious and disastrous character in the history of Israel. Lastly, the long stretch of fully three hundred years, extending throughout the Book of Judges (its last five chapters in right order or wrong)into the opening seven chapters of 1 Samuel, provides one running comment, superabundant almost to repetitiousness, for the illustration of our vers. 3-7; in many cases absolutely <span class="accented">picking out</span> the very colours to match (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-29.htm">Judges 20:29, 31</a>, compared with our ver. 5). To distinguish and separate the very numerous references that might be made is merely supererogatory, and spoils the unmatched mosaic work of the history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-15.htm">Judges 2:15, 18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6, 19-21, 31</a>: 6:1-5, 7-10; 9:32-37; 10:6-16; 11:19, 20; 12:5, 6; 17:5, 6, 13; 20:29, 31; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30 -35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>). It is a long-stretched-out history of a practically atheistic, priest-less, lawless life; divided into narratives of invasion, oppression, servitude (sevenfold, the Mesopotamian, Moabite, Canaanitish, Midianitish, Ammonitish, Philistine, and, it may be added, in order to comprehend all internal strife, Ishmaelitish larger and lesser, yet surprisingly general), smart, cry for help manifestly more the cry of pain and cowardice than of penitence and repentance, resolution and vow, and - for another trial and still another - of Divine pity, forbearance, and deliverance <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Asa, with his people, pursued to Gerar, the old ancient Philistine city, whose ruins Rowlands has discovered in the Khirbet el Gerar, in the Wady Jorf el Gerar (the torrent of Gerar), three leagues south-south-east of Gaza (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1</a>). "And there fell of the Cushites, so that to them was not revival," i.e., so many that they could not make a stand and again collect themselves, ut eis vivificatio i. e. copias restaurandi ratio non esset, as older commentators, in Annott. uberior. ad h. l., have already rightly interpreted it. The words are expressions for complete defeat. Berth. translates incorrectly: "until to them was nothing living;" for &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; does not stand for &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1491;, but &#1500; serves to subordinate the clause, "so that no one," where in the older language &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; alone would have been sufficient, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">2 Chronicles 20:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-4.htm">1 Chronicles 22:4</a>, cf. Ew. 315, c; and &#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; denotes, not "a living thing," but only "preservation of life, vivification, revival, maintenance." For they were broken before Jahve and before His host. &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, i.e., Asa's army is called Jahve's, because Jahve fought in and with it against the enemy. There is no reason to suppose, with some older commentators, that there is any reference to an angelic host or heavenly camp (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>.). And they (Asa and his people) brought back very much booty.</body></html>
