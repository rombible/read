The public teaching of the word of God forms, in all ages, the great method of promoting the power of godliness. Thereby the understanding is informed, the conscience is awakened and directed. We have a particular account of Jehoshaphat's prosperity. But it was not his formidable army that restrained the neighbouring nations from attempting any thing against Israel, but the fear of God which fell upon them, when Jehoshaphat reformed his country, and set up a preaching ministry in it. The ordinances of God are more the strength and safety of a kingdom, than soldiers and weapons of war. The Bible requires use to notice the hand of God in every event, yet this is little regarded. But let all employ the talents they have: be faithful, even in that which is little. Set up the worship of God in your houses. The charge of a family is important. Why should you not instruct them as Jehoshaphat did his subjects, in the book of the law of the Lord. But be consistent. Do not recommend one thing, and practise another. Begin with yourselves. Seek to the Lord God of Israel, then call upon children and servants to follow your example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The princes were not sent as teachers themselves, but had the duty committed to them of seeing that the people were taught.

Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, &#8230; to teach in the cities of Judah&#8212;The ordinary work of teaching devolved on the priests. But extraordinary commissioners were appointed, probably to ascertain whether the work had been done or neglected. This deputation of five princes, assisted by two priests and nine Levites, was to make a circuit of the towns in Judah. It is the first practical measure we read of as being adopted by any of the kings for the religious instruction of the people. Time and unbroken opportunities were afforded for carrying out fully this excellent plan of home education, for the kingdom enjoyed internal tranquillity as well as freedom for foreign wars. It is conformable to the pious style of the sacred historian to trace this profound peace to the "fear of the Lord having fallen on all kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To teach in the cities of Judah; </span> to inform the people of their duty, and of the king’s pleasure.

This deeper fathoming of the needs of the time, and of what constituted its real safety, was greatly to the spiritual credit of Jehoshaphat.

Asa had shown himself weak against Israel, as he had sought help against Baasha's attack from the Syrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>.), but it was otherwise with Jehoshaphat. He indeed put the fenced cities of his kingdom in a thoroughly good condition for defence, to protect his kingdom against hostile attacks from without (v. 20: but he walked at the same time in the ways of the Lord, so that the Lord made his kingdom strong and mighty (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-5</a>). This general characterization of his reign is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a> illustrated by facts: first by the communication of what Jehoshaphat did for the inner spiritual strengthening of the kingdom, by raising the standard of religion and morals among the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6-11</a>), and then by what he did for the external increase of his power (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12-19</a>). </body></html>
