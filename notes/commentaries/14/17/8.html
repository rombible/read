The public teaching of the word of God forms, in all ages, the great method of promoting the power of godliness. Thereby the understanding is informed, the conscience is awakened and directed. We have a particular account of Jehoshaphat's prosperity. But it was not his formidable army that restrained the neighbouring nations from attempting any thing against Israel, but the fear of God which fell upon them, when Jehoshaphat reformed his country, and set up a preaching ministry in it. The ordinances of God are more the strength and safety of a kingdom, than soldiers and weapons of war. The Bible requires use to notice the hand of God in every event, yet this is little regarded. But let all employ the talents they have: be faithful, even in that which is little. Set up the worship of God in your houses. The charge of a family is important. Why should you not instruct them as Jehoshaphat did his subjects, in the book of the law of the Lord. But be consistent. Do not recommend one thing, and practise another. Begin with yourselves. Seek to the Lord God of Israel, then call upon children and servants to follow your example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The princes were not sent as teachers themselves, but had the duty committed to them of seeing that the people were taught.

He Sends Levites to Teach in Judah.<p>7-11. Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, &#8230; to teach in the cities of Judah&#8212;The ordinary work of teaching devolved on the priests. But extraordinary commissioners were appointed, probably to ascertain whether the work had been done or neglected. This deputation of five princes, assisted by two priests and nine Levites, was to make a circuit of the towns in Judah. It is the first practical measure we read of as being adopted by any of the kings for the religious instruction of the people. Time and unbroken opportunities were afforded for carrying out fully this excellent plan of home education, for the kingdom enjoyed internal tranquillity as well as freedom for foreign wars. It is conformable to the pious style of the sacred historian to trace this profound peace to the "fear of the Lord having fallen on all kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And with them he sent Levites,....

God blessed these undertakings. Jahve was with him, because he walked in the ways of David his ancestor, the former ways, and sought not the Baals. The former ways of David are his ways in the earlier years of his reign, in contrast to the later years, in which his adultery with Bathsheba (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>) and the sin of numbering the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a>) fall. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; are all false gods, in contrast to Jahve, the one God of Israel; and here the word designates not only the Baal-worship properly so called, but also the worship of Jahve by means of images, by which Jahve is brought down to the level of the Baals; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>. The &#1500; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; stands, according to the later usage, as a sign of the accusative.
