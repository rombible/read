David, indeed, recovered from that fall, but, perhaps, never, while he lived, fully retrieved the spiritual strength and comfort which he had lost. Jehoshaphat followed David as far as he followed God, and no farther. St. Paul himself thus limits our imitation of him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>, <span class="ital">Follow me, as I follow Christ, </span>and not otherwise. The <span class="ital">first </span>ways of many pious people have been their best ways, and their <span class="ital">first love </span>their strongest love: which, however, ought not to be the case: for the <span class="ital">last </span>ought to be <span class="ital">more than the first, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-19.htm" title="I know your works, and charity, and service, and faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first.">Revelation 2:19</a>. But in every copy we propose to write after, as we ought to single out that only which is good, so that chiefly which is best. The original words here are literally rendered, <span class="ital">He walked in the ways of David his father, </span><span class="greekheb">הראשׁונים</span>, <span class="ital">hareshonim, those first, </span>or <span class="ital">ancient ways. </span>He proposed to himself, for his example, the primitive times of the royal family, those purest times, before the corruptions of the late reigns came in. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Stand you in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.">Jeremiah 6:16</a>. The LXX. leave out <span class="ital">David, </span>and so refer this to Asa: <span class="ital">He walked in the first ways of his father </span>Asa, and did not imitate him in what was amiss in him toward the latter end of his time. It is well to be cautious in following the best men, lest we step aside after them. <span class="ital">And sought not unto Baalim — </span>The neighbouring nations had their Baalim: one had one Baal, and another had another; but he abhorred them all, and had nothing to do with any of them. He <span class="ital">sought the Lord God of his father, </span>and him only; prayed to him only; and inquired of him only.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-19 Jehoshaphat promotes religion in Judah, His prosperity. - Jehoshaphat found his people generally very ignorant, and therefore endeavoured to have them well taught. The public teaching of the word of God forms, in all ages, the great method of promoting the power of godliness. Thereby the understanding is informed, the conscience is awakened and directed. We have a particular account of Jehoshaphat's prosperity. But it was not his formidable army that restrained the neighbouring nations from attempting any thing against Israel, but the fear of God which fell upon them, when Jehoshaphat reformed his country, and set up a preaching ministry in it. The ordinances of God are more the strength and safety of a kingdom, than soldiers and weapons of war. The Bible requires use to notice the hand of God in every event, yet this is little regarded. But let all employ the talents they have: be faithful, even in that which is little. Set up the worship of God in your houses. The charge of a family is important. Why should you not instruct them as Jehoshaphat did his subjects, in the book of the law of the Lord. But be consistent. Do not recommend one thing, and practise another. Begin with yourselves. Seek to the Lord God of Israel, then call upon children and servants to follow your example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first ways of his father David - The Septuagint and several Hebrew manuscripts omit "David," which has probably crept in from the margin, for David's "first ways" are nowhere else contrasted with his later ways.

For it seems more probable that this passage is a reflection upon Asa, whose last ways were much his worst, and of whose repentance we have no evidence, than upon David, who, though he fell dreadfully in the matter of Uriah, yet did manifestly repent of it, and return to his first and holy course of life, in which also he continued until death; having this character given him by the Holy Ghost after his death, that he did right in all things, saving that of Uriah, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-5.htm" title="Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.">1 Kings 15:5</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat,....
