The public teaching of the word of God forms, in all ages, the great method of promoting the power of godliness. Thereby the understanding is informed, the conscience is awakened and directed. We have a particular account of Jehoshaphat's prosperity. But it was not his formidable army that restrained the neighbouring nations from attempting any thing against Israel, but the fear of God which fell upon them, when Jehoshaphat reformed his country, and set up a preaching ministry in it. The ordinances of God are more the strength and safety of a kingdom, than soldiers and weapons of war. The Bible requires use to notice the hand of God in every event, yet this is little regarded. But let all employ the talents they have: be faithful, even in that which is little. Set up the worship of God in your houses. The charge of a family is important. Why should you not instruct them as Jehoshaphat did his subjects, in the book of the law of the Lord. But be consistent. Do not recommend one thing, and practise another. Begin with yourselves. Seek to the Lord God of Israel, then call upon children and servants to follow your example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is no reasonable doubt that this "book of the law" was the Pentateuch - nearly, if not quite, in the shape in which we now have it.

Upon the ten tribes, and on foreign nations about them, as Moabites, Edomites, Syrians, Egyptians, Arabs, and Philistines; this fear, as it came from the Lord, so might be raised and increased by observing, that religion was revived in them; for they might perceive, by former observations made, that the more religious these people were, the more prosperous and formidable they were: <p>so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat; to interrupt him in the work of reformation he was so intent upon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that <i>were</i> round about Judah, so that they <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> made no war against Jehoshaphat.</span><p>(e) Thus God prospers all who with a pure heart seek his glory, and keeps their enemies in fear, so that they are not able to execute their rage against them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>10–13 (no parallel in 1 Kin.).

God blessed these undertakings. Jahve was with him, because he walked in the ways of David his ancestor, the former ways, and sought not the Baals. The former ways of David are his ways in the earlier years of his reign, in contrast to the later years, in which his adultery with Bathsheba (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>) and the sin of numbering the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a>) fall. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; are all false gods, in contrast to Jahve, the one God of Israel; and here the word designates not only the Baal-worship properly so called, but also the worship of Jahve by means of images, by which Jahve is brought down to the level of the Baals; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>. The &#1500; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; stands, according to the later usage, as a sign of the accusative.

The doing of Israel is the worship of Jahve through the images of the golden calves, which the author of the Chronicle includes in the &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;. </body></html>
