That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we should be most earnest for.

This section is found also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40-50</a>. The enumeration of the things wrought in brass coincides to a word, with the exception of trifling linguistic differences and some defects in the text, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40-47</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">2 Chronicles 4:12</a> &#1493;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is the true reading, and we should so read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a> also, since the &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, circumvolutions, are to be distinguished from the &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, crowns; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-16.htm">2 Chronicles 3:16</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-14.htm">2 Chronicles 4:14</a> the first &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is a mistake for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, the second for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-43.htm">1 Kings 7:43</a>; for the verb &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is not required nor expected, as the accusative depends upon &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11</a>, while the number cannot be omitted, since it is always given with the other things.

According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45</a>, we should read &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;. As to &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is accusative of the material, of polished brass; and so also &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1496; &#1504;&#1495;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45</a>, with a similar signification. In reference to the rest, see the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">2 Chronicles 4:19-21</a><p>In the enumeration of the golden furniture of the holy place, our text diverges somewhat more from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-50</a>. On the difference in respect to the tables of the shew-bread, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-20.htm">2 Chronicles 4:20</a> the number and position of the candlesticks in the holy place are not stated as they are in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>, both having been already given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-7.htm">2 Chronicles 4:7</a>. Instead of that, their use is emphasized: to light them, according to the right, before the most holy place (&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-7.htm">2 Chronicles 4:7</a>). As to the decorations and subordinate utensils of the candlesticks, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>. To &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-21.htm">2 Chronicles 4:21</a> (accus. of the material), is added &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, "that is perfect gold." &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, which occurs only here, is synonymous with &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500;, perfection. This addition seems superfluous, because before and afterwards it is remarked of these vessels that they were of precious gold (&#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;), and it is consequently omitted by the lxx, perhaps also because &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; was not intelligible to them. The words, probably, are meant to indicate that even the decorations and the subordinate utensils of the candlesticks (lamps, snuffers, etc.) were of solid gold, and not merely gilded.</body></html>
