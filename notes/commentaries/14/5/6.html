That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we should be most earnest for. When Christ is formed in a soul, the law written in the heart, the ark of the covenant settled there, so that it becomes the temple of the Holy Ghost, there is true satisfaction in that soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Levites took up the ark - i. e., such of the Levites as were also priests (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 5:2-13.

Along with the &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, sacrificial vessels (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8</a>), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-17.htm">1 Chronicles 28:17</a> &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, forks of gold, are also mentioned, which are not elsewhere spoken of. Among the utensils of the tabernacle we find only &#1502;&#1494;&#1500;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514; of brass, flesh-forks, as an appurtenance of the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-14.htm">Numbers 4:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>.), which, however, cannot be intended here, because all the utensils here enumerated belonged to the holy place. What purpose the golden forks served cannot be determined, but the mention of golden knives might lead us to presuppose that there would be golden forks as well. That the forks are not mentioned in our verse does not render their existence doubtful, for the enumeration is not complete: e.g., the &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>, are also omitted. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, vessels for the incense, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, extinguishers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>. Instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; , "and as regards the opening (door) of the house, its door-leaves," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a> we have &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;, "and the hinges of the door-leaves of the house." This suggests that &#1508;&#1514;&#1495; is only an orthographical error for &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;; but then if we take it to be so, we must alter &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; into &#1500;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;. And, moreover, the expression &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;, door-hinges of the house, is strange, as &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; properly denotes a recess or space between, and which renders the above-mentioned conjecture improbable. The author of the Chronicle seems rather himself to have generalized the expression, and emphasizes merely the fact that even the leaves of the doors in the most holy place and on the holy place were of gold; - of course not of solid gold; but they were, as we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-7.htm">2 Chronicles 3:7</a>, overlaid with gold. This interpretation is favoured by the simple &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; being used without the predicate &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;. To the sing. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; no objection can be made, for the word in its fundamental signification, "opening," may easily be taken collectively. </body></html>
