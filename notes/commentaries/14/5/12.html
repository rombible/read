The number of trumpets used in the divine service could not be less than two (Nu 10:2), and their greatest number never exceeded the precedent set at the dedication of the temple. The station where the priests were sounding with trumpets was apart from that of the other musicians; for while the Levite singers occupied an orchestra east of the altar, the priests stood at the marble table on the southwest of the altar. There both of them stood with their faces to the altar. The manner of blowing the trumpets was, first, by a long plain blast, then by one with breakings and quaverings, and then by a long plain blast again [Brown, Jewish Antiquities].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons</span>.

So ends our inopportune Authorized Version parenthesis. But to what all this? It is a scene in a nation's history, in the universal Church's history; it is witnessed from heaven, and by Heaven's will recorded in the book on earth, which will endure through all generations, as long as the sun and moon endure, as ushering in the moment when, as described in the next verse, to the unanimous fervent adoration and praise of man, God bent a willing, gracious ear, and to earth the glory of heaven drew nigh. <span class="accented">Cymbals</span>. The word used here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), denoting strictly "pair of cymbals," occurs eleven times in Chronicles, once in Ezra, and once in Nehemiah. Another form of essentially the same word occurs once in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> and twice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>. This last passage notes two kinds of cymbals - the "loud" and the "high-sounding." It was the former of these that Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun used, and their use was probably to regulate or beat the time (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:375, 376; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 167, 2nd edit.). <span class="accented">Psalteries</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>). This word occurs twenty-eight times in the Old Testament, but of these it is translated (Authorized Version) four times as "viols" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>); it is also once rendered "vessels of <span class="accented">flagons"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-24.htm">Isaiah 22:24</a>), but the margin offers the version "instruments of viols." While the cymbal was, of course, an instrument of percussion, the psaltery was one of strings - its use was as an accompaniment to the voice. The first mention of it is very interesting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). Compare also David's and Solomon's psaltery in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-11.htm">2 Chronicles 9:11</a>. <span class="accented">Harps</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>). This word occurs forty-two times, beginning with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-21.htm">Genesis 4:21</a>. <span class="accented">Trumpets</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e6;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). This word (including eleven of the personal forms of it, as e.g. the person <span class="accented">blowing the trumpet</span>) occurs just forty times, beginning with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>. It was the straight <span class="accented">tuba</span>, and was not, therefore, the same with the ram's-horn shaped <span class="accented">buccina</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>), generally rendered in the Authorized Version "cornet," but sometimes "trumpet;" the specialty of the cornet being to blow a sound for a signal or summons of some sort, whether secular as in war, or sacred as for some festival. The <span class="accented">trumpets</span> of our verse evidently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8</a>) were in a particular sense the instrument of the priests. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Instead of &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, we have in 2 Kings #1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the priests bare the ark; and since even according to the Chronicle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7</a>) the priests bare the ark into the holy place, we must understand by &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; such Levites were also priests. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-5.htm">2 Chronicles 5:5</a>, too the words &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are inexact, and are to be corrected by <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>, &#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;.
