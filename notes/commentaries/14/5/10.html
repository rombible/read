That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we should be most earnest for.

Why the "golden pot" and "Aaron's rod" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>) were not there does not appear.
