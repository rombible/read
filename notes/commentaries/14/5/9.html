This is no doubt right. A letter has fallen out of the Hebrew text. That the chronicler has preserved this remark without modification to suit altered circumstances, and indeed that the compiler of Kings did the same long before him, is a striking instance of the way in which Oriental historiographers are content to borrow with literal exactitude from the works of predecessors, even in cases where such borrowing appears to the modern mind infelicitous.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The ark was a type of Christ, and, as such, a token of the presence of God. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this we should be most earnest for.

The words, "from the ark," are here probably by misposition, and should follow the words, <span class="cmt_word">the staves projected</span>; while the parallel tells us what should be in their place here, namely, "from the holy place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a>). The confusion and omission will merely lie with some copyists, for five manuscripts show the words "from the holy place." There it is unto this day.

In either case, whether the ark or the staves were spoken of, the memorandum is exceedingly interesting and noteworthy, as a patent bare copy of an old record dating before the destruction of the temple, on the part of whether the writer of Kings or Chronicles. Plainly the historian touches ground, and shows us that <span class="accented">we</span> do also; for it is evident that, far from cunningly devised fable, he has before him in either case an <span class="accented">original</span> document. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first part of the celebration was the transfer of the ark from Mount Zion to the temple (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2-14</a>), and in connection with this we have the words in which Solomon celebrates the entry of the Lord into the new temple (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-1.htm">2 Chronicles 6:1-11</a>). This section has been already commented on in the remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1-21</a>, and we have here, consequently, only to set down briefly those discrepancies between our account and that other, which have any influence upon the meaning. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-3.htm">2 Chronicles 5:3</a> the name of the month, &#1492;&#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1495; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>), with which the supplementary clause, "that is the seventh month," is there connected, is omitted, so that we must either change &#1492;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, or supply the name of the month; for the festival is not the seventh month, but was held in that month. </body></html>
