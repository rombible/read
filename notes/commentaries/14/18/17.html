Abundant riches and honour give large opportunities of doing good, but they are attended with many snares and temptations. Men do not know much of the artifices of Satan and the deceitfulness of their own hearts, when they covet riches with the idea of being able to do good with them. What can hurt those whom God will protect? What can shelter those whom God will destroy? Jehoshaphat is safe in his robes, Ahab killed in his armour; for the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. We should be cautious of entangling ourselves in the worldly undertakings of evil men; and still more we should avoid engaging in their sinful projects. But, when they call upon him, God can and will bring his faithful people out of the difficulties and dangers into which they have sinfully run themselves. He has all hearts in his hand, so that he easily rescues them.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-1.htm">1 Kings 22:1-3</a> it is remarked, in connection with the preceding wars of Ahab with the Syrians, that after there had been no war for three years between Aram and Israel, in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah came up to the king of Israel; and the latter, when he and his servants had determined to snatch away from the Syrians the city Ramoth in Gilead, which belonged to Israel, called upon Jehoshaphat to march with him to the war against Ramoth. In the Chronicle the more exact statement, "in the third year," which is intelligible only in connection with the earlier history of Ahab, is exchanged for the indefinite &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1511;&#1509;, "at the end of years;" and mention is made of the festal entertainment which Ahab bestowed upon his guest and his train (&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;), to show the pains which Ahab took to induce King Jehoshaphat to take part in the proposed campaign. He killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; ,ecnadn, and enticed, seduced him to go up with him to Ramoth. &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;, to incite, entice to anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-14.htm">Judges 1:14</a>), frequently to evil; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-7.htm">Deuteronomy 13:7</a>, etc. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, to advance upon a land or a city in a warlike sense. The account which follows of the preparations for the campaign by inquiring of prophets, and of the war itself, vv. 4-34, is in almost verbal agreement with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5-35</a>. Referring to 1 Kings or the commentary on the substance of the narrative, we will here only group together briefly the divergences. Instead of 400 men who were prophets, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-5.htm">2 Chronicles 18:5</a>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5</a> we have about 400 men. It is a statement in round numbers, founded not upon exact enumeration, but upon an approximate estimate. Instead of &#1488;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1501;...&#1492;&#1504;&#1500;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-5.htm">2 Chronicles 18:5</a>, in Kings, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>, we have &#1488;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; &#1488;&#1501;...&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1498;, both verbs being in the same number; and so too in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-14.htm">2 Chronicles 18:14</a>, where in Kings. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-15.htm">1 Kings 22:15</a>, both verbs stand in the plural, notwithstanding that the answer which follows, &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, is addressed to Ahab alone, not to both the kings, while in the Chronicle the answer is given in the plural to both the kings, &#1493;&#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-7.htm">2 Chronicles 18:7</a>, "he prophesies me nothing good, but all his days (i.e., so long as he has been a prophet) evil," the meaning is intensified by the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, which is not found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-9.htm">2 Chronicles 18:9</a>, the &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, which is introduced before the &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1503;, "and sitting upon the threshing-floor," is due to difference of style, for it is quite superfluous for the signification. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-15.htm">2 Chronicles 18:15</a>, the ambiguous words of Micah,' and Jahve will give into the hand of the king" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-15.htm">1 Kings 22:15</a>), are given in a more definite form: "and they (the enemy) shall be given into your hand." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-19.htm">2 Chronicles 18:19</a>, in the first &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492;, the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; after the preceding &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is not only superfluous, but improper, and has probably come into the text by a copyist's error. We should therefore read only &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1494;&#1492;, corresponding to the &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1494;&#1492; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20</a> : "Then spake one after this manner, and the other spake after another manner." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-23.htm">2 Chronicles 18:23</a>, the indefinite &#1488;&#1497;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>, is elucidated by &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1494;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;, "is that the manner" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-12.htm">1 Kings 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>)., and the verb. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; follows without the relative pronoun, as in the passages cited. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-30.htm">2 Chronicles 18:30</a>, only &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; of the king are mentioned, without any statement of the number, which is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>, with a backward reference to the former war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-24.htm">1 Kings 20:24</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31</a>, after the words, "and Jehoshaphat cried out," the higher cause of Jehoshaphat's rescue is pointed out in the words, "and Jahve helped him, and God drove them from him," which are not found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-32.htm">1 Kings 22:32</a>; but by this religious reflection the actual course of the event is in no way altered. Bertheau's remark, therefore, that "the words disturb the clear connection of the events," is quite unwarrantable. Finally, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-34.htm">2 Chronicles 18:34</a>, &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, he was holding his position, i.e., he held himself standing upright, the Hiph. is more expressive than the Hoph. &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>), since it expresses more definitely the fact that he held himself upright by his own strength. With Ahab's death, which took place in the evening at the time of the going down of the sun, the author of the Chronicle concludes his account of this war, and proceeds in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-1.htm">2 Chronicles 19:1-11</a> to narrate the further course of Jehoshaphat's reign. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-36.htm">1 Kings 22:36-39</a>, the return of the defeated army, and the details as to Ahab's death and burial, are recorded; but these did not fit into the plan of the Chronicle. </body></html>
