Let us yield ourselves unto the Lord. Say not, you will do what you please, but resolve to do what he pleases. We perceive in the carnal mind a stiffness, an obstinacy, an unaptness to compel with God; we have it from our fathers: this must be overcome. Those who, through grace, have turned to God themselves, should do all they can to bring others to him. Numbers will be scorners, but some will be humbled and benefited; perhaps where least expected. The rich mercy of God is the great argument by which to enforce repentance; the vilest who submit and yield themselves to the Lord, seek his grace, and give themselves to his service, shall certainly be saved.

Hezekiah Proclaims a Passover.<p>1-5. Hezekiah sent to all &#8230; Judah &#8230; to come to &#8230; Jerusalem, to keep the passover&#8212;This great religious festival had not been regularly observed by the Hebrews in their national capacity for a long time because of the division of the kingdom and the many disorders that had followed that unhappy event. Hezekiah longed extremely to see its observance revived; and the expression of his wishes having received a hearty response from the princes and chief men of his own kingdom, the preparatory steps were taken for a renewed celebration of the national solemnity.<p>letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh&#8212;The names of these leading tribes are used for the whole kingdom of Israel. It was judged impossible, however, that the temple, the priests, and people could be all duly sanctified at the usual time appointed for the anniversary, namely, the fourteenth day of the first month (Nisan). Therefore it was resolved, instead of postponing the feast till another year, to observe it on the fourteenth day of the second month; a liberty which, being in certain circumstances (Nu 9:6-13) granted to individuals, might, it was believed, be allowed to all the people. Hezekiah's proclamation was, of course, authoritative in his own kingdom, but it could not have been made and circulated in all the towns and villages of the neighboring kingdom without the concurrence, or at least the permission, of the Israelitish sovereign. Hoshea, the reigning king, is described as, though evil in some respects, yet more favorably disposed to religious liberty than any of his predecessors since the separation of the kingdom. This is thought to be the meaning of the mitigating clause in his character (2Ki 17:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They could not keep it at that time, </span> which God had appointed for it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm" title="And you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.">Exodus 12:6</a></span>; one reason whereof was evident in itself, because the temple was not then purified and prepared; to which he adds two other reasons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, </span> to wit, in such manner and degree as was fit, nor in such numbers as were necessary for the flaying and offering of so many thousands of paschal offerings, as appears, because they were not sufficient for those offerings, which were comparatively few, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/29-32.htm" title="And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was three score and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD....">2 Chronicles 29:32-34</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem; </span> as they used and ought to do at that time from all places; which now they could not do, because neither the thing was agreed upon, nor the people summoned thither, till the proper time was past. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For they could not keep it at the time,....

But there were too few priests, and they were not able (so that they were not able) to flay all the burnt-offerings; and their brethren the Levites helped them till the work was ended (i.e., the flaying), and until the priests had sanctified themselves. In the case of private burnt-offerings the flaying of the beast was the business of the sacrificer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-6.htm">Leviticus 1:6</a>); while in the case of those offered on solemn occasions in the name of the congregation it was the priest's duty, and in it, as the work was not of a specifically priestly character, the Levites might assist. The burnt-offerings which are spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a> are not merely those voluntarily offered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>), but also the consecratory burnt-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-22.htm">2 Chronicles 29:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-27.htm">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>). Only <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-35.htm">2 Chronicles 29:35</a> refers to the voluntary offerings alone. "For the Levites had been more upright to sanctify themselves than the priests." &#1500;&#1489; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;, rectiores animo, had endeavoured more honestly. Perhaps the priests had taken more part in the idolatrous worship of Ahaz than the Levites, which would be quite accounted for, as Kueper, das Priesterth. des A. Bundes (1870), S. 216, remarks, by their relation to the court of the king, and their dependence upon it. They consequently showed themselves more slack even in the purification than the Levites, who forte etiam idololatricis sacris minus contaminati et impediti erant (Ramb.).</body></html>
