In these Israel looked to God as the God of their fathers, a God in covenant with them. There was also abundance of good preaching. The Levites read and explained the Scriptures. Faith cometh by hearing, and true religion preaching has abounded. They sang psalms every day: praising God should be much of our work in religious assemblies. Having kept the seven days of the feast in this religious manner, they had so much comfort in it, that they kept other seven days also. This they did with gladness. Holy duties should be done with holy gladness. And when sinners humble themselves before the Lord, they may expect gladness in his ordinances. Those who taste this happiness will not soon grow weary of it, but will be glad to prolong their enjoyment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To keep other seven days - This was a voluntary addition to the requirements of the Law - the fruit and sign of the abounding zeal which characterized the time.

This was not the rule: in the case of the paschal lamb, the father of the family who slew the lamb had to hand the blood to the priest, that it might be sprinkled upon the altar; here the Levites did it for the reasons given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-17.htm">2 Chronicles 30:17</a>. Because many in the assembly had not sanctified themselves, the Levites presided over the slaying of the paschal lambs for every one who was unclean, to sanctify (the lambs) to the Lord (see also on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-6.htm">2 Chronicles 35:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-11.htm">2 Chronicles 35:11</a>). &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, stat. constr. before the noun with a preposition, stands as neuter substantively: there was a multitude in the assembly who...&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-18.htm">2 Chronicles 30:18</a> is to be taken in a similar manner, not as an adverb (Berth.). &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; is in apposition to &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, a multitude of people, viz.: Many of Ephraim ... had not purified themselves, but ate the passover in an illegal fashion, not according to the precept (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6</a>). This clause explains how it happened that the Levites presided at the slaying of the passover for those who had not sanctified themselves, i.e., they caught the blood and gave it to the priests. Had this been done by persons levitically unclean, the expiatory sacrificial blood would have been defiled. The eating of the paschal lamb or the participation in the passover meal was indeed allowed only to the clean; but yet it was not so holy an act, i.e., did not bring the people into such immediate contact with God, who was present at His altar, that those who were not clean might not, under some circumstances, be admitted to it. Here it was allowed, for Hezekiah had prayed for them that God might forgive the transgression of the law.</body></html>
