(The mistake was doubtless caused by the omission of the relative in the Hebrew between <span class= "ital">kol,</span> “every one,” and <span class= "ital">lĕbābô hēkîn,</span> “his heart he hath directed.” The construction is parallel to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-12.htm" title="And said to them, You are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it.">1Chronicles 15:12</a>, “unto <span class= "ital">the place that</span> I have prepared for it;” so LXX.) The prayer is, “Jehovah the Good atone for every one who hath directed his heart to seek the <span class= "ital">true</span> God, <span class= "ital">even</span> Jehovah, the God of his fathers, albeit not (literally, <span class= "ital">and not</span>) according to the holy purifying”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> although he hath not rigorously observed the law of purification.<p><span class= "bld">Purification of the sanctuary.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">holy purification:</span> a phrase only found here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-28.htm" title="Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;">1Chronicles 23:28</a>).<p>The prayer evinces a preference of spiritual sincerity to mere literal observance of legal prescriptions, which is all the more remarkable as occurring in a writer whose principal aim is to foster a due reverence for the external ordinances and traditional customs of religion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-19.htm" title="That prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.">2 Chronicles 30:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">That prepareth his heart to seek God — </span>The great thing required in our attendance on God in his ordinances is, that we <span class="ital">prepare our hearts to seek him; </span>that the inward man, the spirit, be engaged; that we make heart-work of our religion. All is nothing without this. Hezekiah does not pray that this might be dispensed with, or that the want of other things might be pardoned or overlooked, where this was not.

Where this sincerity and fixedness of heart are, there may yet be many things short of the purification of the sanctuary. These defects need pardoning, healing grace; for omissions in duty are sins, as well as omissions of duty. If God should deal with us in strict justice, even as to the very best of our doings, we should be undone. The way to obtain pardon, is to seek it of God by prayer; it must be gotten by petition through the blood of Christ. Yet every defect is sin, and needs forgiveness; and should be matter to humble, but not to discourage us, though nothing can make up for the want of a heart prepared to seek the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After their manner - According to the Mishna, the custom was for the priests to stand in two rows extending from the altar to the outer court, where the people were assembled. As each offerer killed his lamb the blood was caught in a basin, which was handed to the nearest priest, who passed it on to his neighbor, and he to the next; the blood was thus conveyed to the altar, at the base of which it was thrown by the last priest in the row. While basins full of blood were thus passed up, empty basins were passed down in a constant succession, so that there was no pause or delay.<p>Which they received of the hand of the Levites - Ordinarily, the blood was received at the hand of the offerer. But the greater number of the Israelites <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-17.htm">2 Chronicles 30:17</a> who had come to keep the feast were involved in some ceremonial or moral defilement, from which there had not been time for them to purify themselves. On account of this uncleanness, they did not slay their own lambs, but delegated the office to the Levites. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-18. the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites&#8212;This was a deviation from the established rules and practices in presenting the offerings of the temple. The reason was, that many present on the occasion having not sanctified themselves, the Levites slaughtered the paschal victims (see on [465]2Ch 35:5) for everyone that was unclean. At other times the heads of families killed the lambs themselves, the priests receiving the blood from their hands and presenting it on the altar. Multitudes of the Israelites, especially from certain tribes (2Ch 30:18), were in this unsanctified state, and yet they ate the passover&#8212;an exceptional feature and one opposed to the law (Nu 9:6); but this exception was allowed in answer to Hezekiah's prayer (2Ch 30:18-20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. With that ceremonial purification which was required of them that came into God’s sanctuary.
