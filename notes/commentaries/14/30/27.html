In performing this office, they were both the people’s mouth to God, by way of prayer, and God’s mouth to the people, by way of promise; for the blessing included both. And in it they testified both their desire of the people’s welfare, and their dependance upon God and the word of his grace, to which they commended them. <span class="ital">And their prayer came up to his holy dwelling-place — </span>The voice of the priests, when they thus blessed the people, as God had commanded, <span class="ital">was heard in heaven. </span>God said amen to their prayer, and perhaps gave some sensible token of the ratification of the blessing which they had pronounced. The prayer that comes up to heaven in a cloud of incense, will come down again to this earth in showers of blessings. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:21-27 Many prayers were put up to God with the peace-offerings. In these Israel looked to God as the God of their fathers, a God in covenant with them. There was also abundance of good preaching. The Levites read and explained the Scriptures. Faith cometh by hearing, and true religion preaching has abounded. They sang psalms every day: praising God should be much of our work in religious assemblies. Having kept the seven days of the feast in this religious manner, they had so much comfort in it, that they kept other seven days also. This they did with gladness. Holy duties should be done with holy gladness. And when sinners humble themselves before the Lord, they may expect gladness in his ordinances. Those who taste this happiness will not soon grow weary of it, but will be glad to prolong their enjoyment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Since the time of Solomon - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8-10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. and a great number of priests sanctified themselves&#8212;so that there would be a sufficient number of hands for the additional services.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The priests the Levites; </span> those of the Levites who were priests also; for to them only this work belonged, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-13.htm" title="The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever.">1 Chronicles 23:13</a></span>.
