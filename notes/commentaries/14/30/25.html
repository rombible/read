In these Israel looked to God as the God of their fathers, a God in covenant with them. There was also abundance of good preaching. The Levites read and explained the Scriptures. Faith cometh by hearing, and true religion preaching has abounded. They sang psalms every day: praising God should be much of our work in religious assemblies. Having kept the seven days of the feast in this religious manner, they had so much comfort in it, that they kept other seven days also. This they did with gladness. Holy duties should be done with holy gladness. And when sinners humble themselves before the Lord, they may expect gladness in his ordinances. Those who taste this happiness will not soon grow weary of it, but will be glad to prolong their enjoyment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The strangers - See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. and a great number of priests sanctified themselves&#8212;so that there would be a sufficient number of hands for the additional services.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and Levites,....

Some consider this describes "proselytes from Israel, who were non-Israelites." But this seems a most gratuitous supposition. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> does, in fact, purport only "sojourners," and is frequently so translated, and our next clause corroborates this view. The interesting aspect of it is, that probably the persons described had emigrated from their own tribes, as they longed for Jerusalem, "their chief joy." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-18.htm">2 Chronicles 30:18</a> ends, according to the Masoretic verse-division, with the preposition &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;; but that division seems merely to have arisen from ignorance of the construction heekiyn &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;-lbaabow, of the fact that &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; stands before a relative sentence without &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, like &#1488;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-12.htm">1 Chronicles 15:12</a>, and is certainly wrong. If we separate &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491; from what follows, we must, with Aben Ezra, supply &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, and make &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-19.htm">2 Chronicles 30:19</a>) refer to Hezekiah, both being equally inadmissible. Rightly, therefore, the lxx, Vulg., and also Kimchi, with the majority of commentators, have given up this division of the verses as incorrect, and connected the words in this way: May the good Jahve atone, i.e., forgive every one who has fixed his heart (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-14.htm">2 Chronicles 12:14</a>) to seek God, Jahve, the God of his fathers, but not in accordance with the purity of the sanctuary. This intercession of Hezekiah's is worthy of remark, not only because it expresses the conviction that upright seeking of the Lord, which proceeds from the heart, is to be more highly estimated than strict observance of the letter of the law, but also because Hezekiah presumes that those who had come out of Ephraim, etc., to the passover had fixed their heart to seek Jahve, the God of their fathers, but had not been in a position to comply with the precept of the law, i.e., to purify themselves up to the day appointed for the passover.</body></html>
