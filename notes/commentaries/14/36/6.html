The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The narrative runs parallel with 2 Kings marginal reference) as far as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>.

Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon&#8212;This refers to the first expedition of Nebuchadnezzar against Palestine, in the lifetime of his father Nabopolassar, who, being old and infirm, adopted his son as joint sovereign and despatched him, with the command of his army, against the Egyptian invaders of his empire. Nebuchadnezzar defeated them at Carchemish, drove them out of Asia, and reduced all the provinces west of the Euphrates to obedience&#8212;among the rest the kingdom of Jehoiakim, who became a vassal of the Assyrian empire (2Ki 24:1). Jehoiakim at the end of three years threw off the yoke, being probably instigated to revolt by the solicitations of the king of Egypt, who planned a new expedition against Carchemish. But he was completely vanquished by the Babylonian king, who stripped him of all his possessions between the Euphrates and the Nile (2Ki 24:7). Then marching against the Egyptian's ally in Judah, he took Jerusalem, carried away a portion of the sacred vessels of the temple, perhaps in lieu of the unpaid tribute, and deposited them in the temple of his god, Belus, at Babylon (Da 1:2; 5:2). Though Jehoiakim had been taken prisoner (and it was designed at first to transport him in chains to Babylon), he was allowed to remain in his tributary kingdom. But having given not long after some new offense, Jerusalem was besieged by a host of Assyrian dependents. In a sally against them Jehoiakim was killed (see on [478]2Ki 24:2-7; also Jer 22:18, 19; 36:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,....

The only purely historical inscription relating to his reign deals with <span class="bld">a</span> campaign in Egypt in 568 b.c.; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm" title="And when he comes, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.">Jeremiah 43:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nebuchadnezzar</span>] It seems probable that Nebuchadnezzar did not <span class="ital">in person</span> come up against Jerusalem <span class="ital">at the end of Jehoiakim’s reign</span>, nor in person carry off any of the sacred vessels; it is likely moreover that Jehoiakim was not carried to Babylon. The result of Jehoiakim’s rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar was according to 2 Kin. simply that “bands” of Chaldeans and their allies invaded Judah. Probably Jehoiakim’s life and reign came to an end (<span class="ital">how</span> we do not know; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!...">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>) during this petty warfare, and then three months later, the main Chaldean army under Nebuchadnezzar having arrived, Jerusalem was taken, and Jehoiakim’s son and successor Jehoiachin was carried off with the golden vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon. The Chronicler seems to foreshorten the history at this point.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon</span>. Our mere allusions in this and the following verse to Nebuchadnezzar's relations to Jehoiakim and Judah are strange in comparison with the graphic account furnished by the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-6</a>). The name is the same with <span class="accented">Nabokodrosoros</span>, is written in the Assyrian monuments <span class="accented">Nebu-kuduri-utzur</span>, and meaning, "Nebo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>), protector from ill," or "protects the crown." In Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28</a>) we have the name written Nebuchadrezzar, as also in Ezekiel. Nebuchadnezzar, second King of Babylon, was the son of Nabopolassar, who took Nineveh  <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>, and reigned above forty years. Though we are here told he bound Jehoiakim in chains, to take him to Babylon, for some reason or other he did not carry out this intention, and Jehoiakim was put to death at Jerusalem (Jeremiah 12:18, 19; Jeremiah 36:30; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-8.htm">Ezekiel 19:8, 9</a>). The expedition of Nebuchadnezzar was  <span class="date">B.C. 605-4</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a>), and <span class="accented">during</span> it, his father dying, he succeeded to the throne. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The death of the pious king was deeply lamented by his people. The prophet Jeremiah composed a lamentation for Josiah: "and all the singing-men and singing-women spake in their lamentations of Josiah unto this day;" i.e., in the lamentation which they were wont to sing on certain fixed days, they sung also the lamentation for Josiah. "And they made them (these lamentations) an ordinance (a standing custom) in Israel, and they are written in the lamentations," i.e., in a collection of lamentations, in which, among others, that composed by Jeremiah on the death of Josiah was contained. This collection is, however, not to be identified with the Lamentations of Jeremiah over the destruction of Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah, contained in our canon. - On <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>. cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-28.htm">2 Kings 23:28</a>. &#1492;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-32.htm">2 Chronicles 32:32</a>. &#1489;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-3.htm">2 Chronicles 31:3</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; is the continuation of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>). </body></html>
