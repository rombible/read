The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The narrative runs parallel with 2 Kings marginal reference) as far as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>.

Jehoahaz, Succeeding, Is Deposed by Pharaoh.<p>1. the people of the land took Jehoahaz&#8212;Immediately after Josiah's overthrow and death, the people raised to the throne Shallum (1Ch 3:15), afterwards called Jehoahaz, in preference to his older brother Eliakim, from whom they expected little good. Jehoahaz is said (2Ki 23:30) to have received at Jerusalem the royal anointing&#8212;a ceremony not usually deemed necessary, in circumstances of regular and undisputed succession. But, in the case of Jehoahaz, it seems to have been resorted to in order to impart greater validity to the act of popular election; and, it may be, to render it less likely to be disturbed by Necho, who, like all Egyptians, would associate the idea of sanctity with the regal anointing. He was the youngest son of Josiah, but the popular favorite, probably on account of his martial spirit (Eze 19:3) and determined opposition to the aggressive views of Egypt. At his accession the land was free from idolatry; but this prince, instead of following the footsteps of his excellent father, adopted the criminal policy of his apostatizing predecessors. Through his influence, directly or indirectly used, idolatry rapidly increased (see 2Ki 23:32).Jehoahaz succeeding is deposed by Pharaoh, and carried to Egypt, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/36-1.htm" title="Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem....">2 Chronicles 36:1-4</a></span>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>, as in the affecting passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10-12</a>, his name appears as <span class="accented">Shallum</span>. His mother's name was Hamutal, while the name of the mother of his immediate sue-cessor was Zebudah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a> and 2 Kings 23:36). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Josiah turned not his face from him, i.e., did not abandon his design, "but to make war against him he disguised himself." &#1492;&#1514;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474; denotes elsewhere to disguise by clothing, to clothe oneself falsely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-29.htm">2 Chronicles 18:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-38.htm">1 Kings 20:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-30.htm">1 Kings 22:30</a>), and to disfigure oneself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm">Job 30:18</a>). This signification is suitable here also, where the word is transferred to the mental domain: to disfigure oneself, i.e., to undertake anything which contradicts one's character. During his whole reign, Josiah had endeavoured to carry out the will of God; while in his action against Pharaoh, on the contrary, he had acted in a different way, going into battle against the will of God.<p>(Note: Bertheau would alter &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; into    &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;, because the lxx, and probably also the Vulg., Syr., 3 Esr. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-16.htm">2 Chronicles 1:16</a>, and perhaps also Josephus, have so read.

The author of the Chronicle judges the matter from the religious point of view, from which the undertaking is seen to have been against the will of God, and therefore to have ended in Josiah's destruction, and does not further reflect on the working of divine providence, exhibited in the fact that the pious king was taken away before the judgment, the destruction of the kingdom of Judah, broke over the sinful people. For further information as to the Valley of Megiddo, the place where the battle was fought, and on the death of Josiah, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>.
