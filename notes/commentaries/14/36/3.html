The LXX. follows the reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.">2Kings 23:33</a> : “And Pharaoh-necho bound him in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, from reigning (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> so that he reigned not) in Jerusalem “; but the Syriac and Vulg. support the existing Hebrew text. The LXX. begins the verse thus: “And he did the evil before the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done; “and adds, after the clause about the fine, “and the king took him away to Egypt.”<p><span class= "bld">Condemned the land in.</span>—<span class= "ital">Fined the land.—So</span> Kings: “laid a fine upon the land.”<p>Riblah was in Syria, on the river Orontes.

The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The narrative runs parallel with 2 Kings marginal reference) as far as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>.

This signification is suitable here also, where the word is transferred to the mental domain: to disfigure oneself, i.e., to undertake anything which contradicts one's character. During his whole reign, Josiah had endeavoured to carry out the will of God; while in his action against Pharaoh, on the contrary, he had acted in a different way, going into battle against the will of God.<p>(Note: Bertheau would alter &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; into    &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;, because the lxx, and probably also the Vulg., Syr., 3 Esr. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-16.htm">2 Chronicles 1:16</a>, and perhaps also Josephus, have so read. But only the lxx have &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, Vulg. praeparavit, 3 Esr. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;; so that for &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; only the lxx remain, whose translation gives no sufficient ground for an alteration of the text. &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;, to show oneself strong, or courageous, is not at all suitable; for the author of the Chronicle is not wont to regard enterprises undertaken against God's will, and unfortunate in their results, as proofs of physical or spiritual strength.)<p>As to the motive which induced Josiah, notwithstanding Necho's warning, to oppose him by force of arms, see the remark on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>. The author of the Chronicle judges the matter from the religious point of view, from which the undertaking is seen to have been against the will of God, and therefore to have ended in Josiah's destruction, and does not further reflect on the working of divine providence, exhibited in the fact that the pious king was taken away before the judgment, the destruction of the kingdom of Judah, broke over the sinful people. For further information as to the Valley of Megiddo, the place where the battle was fought, and on the death of Josiah, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>.
