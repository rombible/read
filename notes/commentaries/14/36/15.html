The methods God takes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and his unwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sin makes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthly blessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had many times ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedience of men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest. What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished? If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not be high-minded, but fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Polluted the house of the Lord - Toward the close of Zedekiah's reign idolatrous rites of several different kinds were intruded into the sacred precincts of the temple (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10-16</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. who had made him swear by God&#8212;Zedekiah received his crown on the express condition of taking a solemn oath of fealty to the king of Babylon (Eze 17:13); so that his revolt by joining in a league with Pharaoh-hophra, king of Egypt, involved the crime of perjury. His own pride and obdurate impiety, the incurable idolatry of the nation, and their reckless disregard of prophetic warnings, brought down on his already sadly reduced kingdom the long threatened judgments of God. Nebuchadnezzar, the executioner of the divine vengeance, commenced a third siege of Jerusalem, which, after holding out for a year and a half, was taken in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah. It resulted in the burning of the temple, with, most probably, the ark, and in the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah (see on [480]2Ki 25:1-7; [481]Eze 12:13; [482]Eze 17:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Rising up betimes, and sending, </span> i.e. sending them early and diligently, as a careful householder who riseth betimes about his business, and pursues it till night come.

Cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8-17</a>. - Jehoiachin's age at his accession is here given as eight years, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a> it is eighteen. It is so also in the lxx and Vulg.; but a few Hebr. codd., Syr., and Arab., and many manuscripts of the lxx, have eighteen years in the Chronicle also. The number eight is clearly an orthographical error, as Thenius also acknowledges. Bertheau, on the contrary, regards the eight of our text as the original, and the number eighteen in 2 Kings s an alteration occasioned by the idea that eighteen years appeared a more fitting age for a king than eight years, and gives as his reason, "that the king's mother is named along with him, and manifestly with design, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-26.htm">Jeremiah 22:26</a>, whence we must conclude that she had the guardianship of the young king." A perfectly worthless reason. In the books of Kings the name of the mother is given in the case of all the kings after their accession has been mentioned, without any reference to the age of the kings, because the queen-mother occupied a conspicuous position in the kingdom. It is so in the case of Jehoiakim and Jehoiachin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>. On account of her high position, the queen-mother is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, and in Jeremiah, among those who submitted to Nebuchadnezzar and were carried away to Babylon. The correctness of the number eighteen is, however, placed beyond doubt by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-5.htm">Ezekiel 19:5-9</a>, where the prophet portrays Jehoiachin as a young lion, which devoured men, and knew widows, and wasted cities. The knowing of widows cannot apply to a boy of eight, but might well be said of a young man of eighteen. Jehoiachin ruled only three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and did evil in the eyes of Jahve. At the turn of the year, i.e., in spring, when campaigns were usually opened (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-22.htm">1 Kings 20:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>), Nebuchadnezzar sent his generals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10</a>), and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jahve, and made his (father's) brother Zedekiah king in Judah. In these few words the end of Jehoiachin's short reign is recorded. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-16</a> we learn more as to this second campaign of Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem, and its issues for Judah; see the commentary on that passage. Zidkiyah (Zedekiah) was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>, not a brother, but &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;, uncle or father's brother, of Jehoiachin, and was called Mattaniah, a son of Josiah and Hamutal, like Jehoahaz (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>), and is consequently his full brother, and a step-brother of Jehoiakim. At his appointment to the kingdom by Nebuchadnezzar he received the name Zidkiyah (Zedekiah). &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>, is accordingly to be taken in its wider signification of blood-relation. </body></html>
