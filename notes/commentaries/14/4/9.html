Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied.

The Two Courts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">the court of the priests, and the great court</span>] There is a difficulty in this mention of two Temple courts by the Chronicler, for it may be doubted whether Solomon’s Temple, strictly speaking, had more than <span class="ital">one</span> court, for in “the other court” stood Solomon’s house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm" title="And his house where he dwelled had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like to this porch.">1 Kings 7:8</a>). This “other court” seems to be called the “middle court” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,">2 Kings 20:4</a>), and the “higher court” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>). The “great court” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-12.htm" title="And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.">1 Kings 7:12</a>) was perhaps a third court containing not only the king’s house, but all the royal buildings as well. The Heb. word for “court” in all the above passages is <span class="ital">ḥâçer</span>, but here the “court (<span class="ital">ḥâççr</span>) of the priests” is distinguished from a court called the “great court” (Heb. “great <span class="ital">Azârâh</span>”). Perhaps the Chronicler wishes to make the same distinction when he says that Solomon’s great prayer was offered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm" title="For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court: and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>) in “the court” (Heb. <span class="ital">Azârâh</span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The court of the priests</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-36.htm">1 Kings 6:36</a>, where this court is denominated the inner court, and any other court an <span class="accented">outer</span> one, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="cmt_word">the great court</span> only implicated thereby). The construction of this court of the priests, withheld here, given there, leaves it ambiguous whether the "three rows of hewed stones and one row of cedar beams "intends a description of fence, as the Septuagint seems to have taken it, or of a higher floor with which the part in question was dignified. The citation <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, though probably pointing to this same court, can scarcely be adduced as any support of J. D. Michaelis' suggestion of this latter, as its <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (translated "higher") does not really carry the idea of the comparative degree at all. For once that it is so translated (and even then probably incorrectly), there are twenty occurrences of it as the superlative <span class="accented">excellentiae.</span> The introduction just here of any statement of these courts at all, which seems at first inopportune, is probably accounted for by the desire to speak in this connection of their doors and the brass overlaying of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-12.htm">1 Kings 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-5.htm">2 Chronicles 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-28.htm">Ezekiel 40:28</a>; Condor's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 370). It is worthy of note that the word employed in our text, as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>, is not the familiar word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> of all previous similar occasions, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;</span>, a word of the later Hebrew, occurring also several times in Ezekiel, though not in exactly the same sense, and the elementary signification of the verb-root of which is "to gird," or "surround." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brazen sea described as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>.

The differences in substance, such as the occurrence of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-3.htm">2 Chronicles 4:3</a>, instead of &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, and 3000 baths instead of 2000, are probably the result of orthographical errors in the Chronicle. &#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a> appears superfluous after the preceding &#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, and Berth. considers it a gloss which has come from 1 Kings to our text by mistake. But the expression is only pleonastic: "receiving baths, 3000 it held;" and there is no sufficient reason to strike out the words. </body></html>
