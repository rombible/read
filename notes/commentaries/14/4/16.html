Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ for all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Huram his father - Or, "Huram his master-workman" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

As to the great or outer court, the only remark made is that it had doors, and its doors, i.e., the folds or leaves of the doors, were overlaid with copper. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-10.htm">2 Chronicles 4:10</a> we have a supplementary statement as to the position of the brazen sea, which coincides with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-39.htm">1 Kings 7:39</a>; see on the passage. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11</a> the heavier brazen (copper) utensils, belonging to the altar of burnt-offering, are mentioned: &#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, pots for the removal of the ashes; &#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, shovels, to take the ashes out from the altar; and &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, basins to catch and sprinkle the sacrificial blood. This half verse belongs to the preceding, notwithstanding that Huram is mentioned as the maker. This is clear beyond doubt, from the fact that the same utensils are again introduced in the summary catalogue which follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-16.htm">2 Chronicles 4:16</a>). </body></html>
