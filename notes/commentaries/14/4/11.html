Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied.

As stated above, the Hebrew word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. It occurs in the Old Testament twenty-seven times; it is translated in our Authorized Version "pans" once and "caldrons" four times. By a manifest copyist's error, the parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-35.htm">1 Kings 7:35</a>) has <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, "layers," by the use of <span class="accented">caph</span> for <span class="accented">samech.</span> The use of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> was to boil the peace offerings, though some say they were hods in which to carry away the ashes; and it certainly is remarkable that it is no one of the words employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a>. In addition to these twenty-seven times, it occurs also <span class="accented">four</span> times in Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, Hosed, Nahum, with the meaning of "thorns," and once in Amos it is translated "fish-hooks." The passage in Ecclesiastes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>) is additionally remarkable, in the fact that the root occurs twice in the same sentence in its different significations, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "the crackling of <span class="accented">thorns</span> under a pot." <span class="cmt_word">The shovels</span>. The Hebrew word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. This word occurs in the Old Testament nine times - in Exodus, Numbers, Kings, Chronicles, and Jeremiah. The use of the <span class="accented">shovel</span> was to remove the ashes. <span class="cmt_word">The basins</span> should very probably read <span class="accented">flesh-hooks.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brazen sea described as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>. See the commentary on that passage, and the sketch in my Archaeol. i. plate iii. fig. 1. The differences in substance, such as the occurrence of &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-3.htm">2 Chronicles 4:3</a>, instead of &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, and 3000 baths instead of 2000, are probably the result of orthographical errors in the Chronicle. &#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a> appears superfluous after the preceding &#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, and Berth. considers it a gloss which has come from 1 Kings to our text by mistake. But the expression is only pleonastic: "receiving baths, 3000 it held;" and there is no sufficient reason to strike out the words. </body></html>
