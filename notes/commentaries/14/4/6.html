(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/7-27.htm" title="And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.">1Kings 7:27-39</a>.)<p>(6) The chronicler now returns to his abbreviating style, and omits altogether the description of the ten bases, or stands, upon which the lavers were placed, and which are described in full and curious detail in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/7-27.htm" title="And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.">1Kings 7:27-39</a>. The unusual difficulty of the passage may have determined the omission, but it seems more likely that the sacred writer thought the bases of less importance than the objects described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/4-7.htm" title="And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.">2Chronicles 4:7-9</a>, the account of which he has interpolated between the first and second half of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-39.htm" title="And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.">1Kings 7:39</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He made also ten lavers.</span>—<span class= "ital">And he made ten pans.</span> The word<span class= "ital"> kîyôr </span>is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm" title="And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the meat hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.">1Samuel 2:14</a> as a <span class= "ital">pan f</span>or cooking, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-6.htm" title="In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.">Zechariah 12:6</a> as a <span class= "ital">pan</span> holding fire. Its meaning here and in the parallel place is a pan for washing. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm" title="You shall also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash with: and you shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and you shall put water therein.">Exodus 30:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-28.htm" title="And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.">Exodus 30:28</a>.) The LXX. renders <span class= "greekheb">λουτῆρας</span><span class= "ital">,</span> “baths;” the Syriac, <span class= "ital">laqnê,</span> “flagons” (<span class= "ital">lagenae, </span><span class= "greekheb">λάγηνοι</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">To wash in them.</span>—This statement, and, indeed, the rest of the verse is peculiar to the chronicler. On the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-38.htm" title="Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and on every one of the ten bases one laver.">1Kings 7:38</a> specifies the size and capacity of the lavers here omitted.<p><span class= "bld">Such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them.</span>—This gives the meaning. Literally, <span class= "ital">the work</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm" title="And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.">Exodus 29:36</a>, “to do” being equivalent to “to offer”) <span class= "ital">of the burnt</span> <span class= "ital">offering they used to rinse</span> (strictly, <span class= "ital">thrust, plunge</span>)<span class= "ital"> in them.</span><p><span class= "bld">But the sea was for the priests to wash in.</span>—The Hebrew words have been transposed apparently. The same infinitive (<span class= "ital">lĕrohçāh</span>) occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm" title="You shall also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash with: and you shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and you shall put water therein.">Exodus 30:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-30.htm" title="And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash with.">Exodus 40:30</a>, in a similar context. Instead of all this, the Syriac and Arabic versions read: “put them five on the right hand and five on the left, that the priests might wash in them <span class= "ital">their hands and their feet,”</span> which appears to be derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-19.htm" title="For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:">Exodus 30:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-31.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:">Exodus 40:31</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-22 The furniture of the temple. - Here is a further account of the furniture of God's house. Both without doors and within, there was that which typified the grace of the gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which the substance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this was not mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices were offered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in the courts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led to consider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, to take away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls and goats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices, their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God and his favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixed upon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of the tabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and his worshippers multiplied.
