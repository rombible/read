A man's pride will bring him low, Pr 29:23; it goes before his destruction, and deservedly brings it on. He that exalteth himself shall be abased. He that goes forth hastily to strive, will not know what he shall do in the end thereof, when his neighbour has put him to shame, Pr 25:8. And what are we when we offer to establish our own righteousness, or presume to justify ourselves before the Most High God, but despicable thistles, that fancy themselves stately cedars? And are not various temptations, is not every corruption, a wild beast of the desert, which will trample on the wretched boaster, and tread his haughty pretensions to the dust? A man's pride shall bring him low; his ruin may be dated from his turning from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art thou made of the king's counsel? - A subtle irony: "Have I made thee one of my council?

The proposal may be either to fight or (better) to discuss Amaziah’s claims, the two kings meeting as equals. The latter is probably the right alternative, for the answer of Joash draws a scoffing parallel between Amaziah’s proposition and a thorn’s proposal of alliance with a cedar.

As to the Valley of Salt, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>. Besides the 10,000 slain in the battle, the men of Judah took 10,000 other Edomites prisoners, whom they cast from the top of a rock. This statement is wanting in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>, where, instead of it, the capture of the city Sela (Petra) is mentioned. The conjecture of Thenius, that this last statement of the Chronicle has been derived from a text of the Kings which had become illegible at this place, has already been rejected as untenable by Bertheau. Except the word &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;, the two texts have nothing in common with each other; but it does suggest itself that &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, the top of the rock (which has become famous by this event), is to be looked for in the neighbourhood of the city Selah, as the war was ended only by the capture of Selah. Besides the battle in the Valley of Salt there were still further battles; and in the <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10</a>,000, manifestly the whole of the prisoners taken in the war are comprehended, who, as irreconcilable enemies of Judah, were not made slaves, but were slain by being thrown down from a perpendicular rock.</body></html>
