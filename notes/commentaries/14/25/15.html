The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to be answered; themselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to be answered; but he was bidden not to say a word more.

Sometimes as with the Romans, the object was worship, especially when the gods were previously among those of the conquering country, and the images had the reputation of special sanctity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-16. Amaziah &#8230; brought the gods of the children of Seir&#8212;The Edomites worshipped the sun under different forms and with various rites. But burning incense upon altars was a principal act of worship, and this was the very thing Amaziah is described as having with strange infatuation performed. Whether he had been captivated with the beauty of the images, or hoped by honoring the gods to disarm their spite at him for his conquest and harsh treatment of their votaries, his conduct in establishing these objects of religious homage in Jerusalem was foolish, ignorant, and highly offensive to God, who commissioned a prophet to rebuke him for his apostasy, and threaten him with the calamity that soon after befell him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Therefore thou art not only ungrateful and impious, but also ridiculously foolish, in offending that God whose power and goodness thou hast now found, and in worshipping such gods of whose impotency thou hast had late experience. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah,....

Amaziah thereupon dismissed the hired Ephraimite mercenaries. &#1497;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, he separated them (sc., from his army prepared for battle), viz., the band, that they might go to their place, i.e., might return home.

But the auxiliaries thus dismissed returned home full of wrath against Judah, and afterwards fell upon the border cities of Judah, wasting and plundering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-13.htm">2 Chronicles 25:13</a>). Their anger probably arose from the fact that by their dismissal the opportunity of making a rich booty in war was taken away.</body></html>
