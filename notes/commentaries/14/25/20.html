He that goes forth hastily to strive, will not know what he shall do in the end thereof, when his neighbour has put him to shame, Pr 25:8. And what are we when we offer to establish our own righteousness, or presume to justify ourselves before the Most High God, but despicable thistles, that fancy themselves stately cedars? And are not various temptations, is not every corruption, a wild beast of the desert, which will trample on the wretched boaster, and tread his haughty pretensions to the dust?

The parallel shows the statement, <span class="cmt_word">But Amaziah would not hear</span>, followed up immediately by "Therefore Jehoash...  went up." Our own verse, in the use of the plural pronoun them, and again <span class="cmt_word">they</span>, takes some slight amount of the weight of guilt in the matter of the idolatry from the shoulders of the king, that it may be shared by the people, and no doubt chiefly again by the "princes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Amaziah's idolatry. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>. On his return from smiting the Edomites, i.e., from the war in which he had smitten the Edomites, Amaziah brought the gods (images) of the sons of Seir (the inhabitants of Mount Seir) with him, and set them up as gods, giving them religious adoration.<p>(Note: This statement, which is not found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a>, may, in the opinion of Berth., perhaps not rest upon a definite tradition, but be merely the application of a principle which generally was found to act in the history of Israel to a particular case; i.e., it may be a clothing in historical garments of the principle that divine punishment came upon the idolatrous king, because it does not agree with the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-3.htm">2 Kings 14:3</a>. In that passage it is said of Amaziah: He did what was right in the eyes of Jahve, only not as David; altogether as his father Joash had done, did he. But Joash allowed his princes, after Jehoiada's death, to worship idols and Asheras, and had caused the prophet Zechariah, who reproved this idolatry, to be stoned. These are facts which, it is true, are narrated only in the Chronicle, but which are admitted by Bertheau himself to be historical. Now if Amaziah did altogether the same as his father Joash, who allowed idolatry, etc., it is hard indeed to see wherein the inconsistency of our account of Amaziah's idolatry with the character assigned to this king in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-3.htm">2 Kings 14:3</a> consists. Bertheau has omitted to give us any more definite information on this point.)<p>In order to turn him away from this sin, which would certainly kindle Jahve's wrath, a prophet said to Amaziah, "Why dost thou seek the gods of the people, who have not delivered their people out of your hand?" The prophet keeps in view the motive which had induced the king to set up and worship the Edomite idols, viz., the belief of all polytheists, that in order to make a people subject, one must seek to win over their gods (cf. on this belief that remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17</a>), and exposes the folly of this belief by pointing out the impotence of the Edomite idols, which Amaziah himself had learnt to know.</body></html>
