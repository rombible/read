This savage massacre of prisoners is not mentioned in Kings; but it is quite credible, in view of the well-known atrocities of ancient warfare.

Thenius, therefore, supposes that the statement of this verse is really the result of an attempt to restore an illegible text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2Kings 14:7</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-13 Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The top of the rock - Rather, "the height of Selah" (or, Petra), near which the battle was probably fought.

The arms of Amaziah, in reward for his obedience to the divine will, were crowned with victory&#8212;ten thousand of the Edomites were slain on the field, and as many taken prisoners, who were put to death by precipitation "from the top of the rock" [2Ch 25:12]. This rock might be situated in the neighborhood of the battlefield, but more probably it formed one of the high craggy cliffs of Selah (Petra), the capital of the Edomites, whither Amaziah marched directly from the Valley of Salt, and which he captured (2Ki 14:7). The savage cruelty dealt out to them was either in retaliation for similar barbarities inflicted on the Hebrews, or to strike terror into so rebellious a people for the future. The mode of execution, by dashing against stones (Ps 137:9), was common among many ancient nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive,....

The “left alive” of the A.V. is misleading, for it suggests that they were prisoners captured in the same battle in which the first ten thousand were slain; a comparison of Kings however suggests that they were the whole (or part) of the garrison of Sela, which fortress was captured by Amaziah after his victory in the valley of salt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the rock</span>] R.V. mg. <span class="bld">Sela</span>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2 Kings 14:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm" title="Your terribleness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, that hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:16</a>.

The parallel tells us the interesting fact that Amaziah, perhaps under the influence of a spasmodic touch of devout-hess or gratitude, changed the name of Selah, or rather endeavoured to change it, to Joktheel, which Gesenius translates "subjugated of God." This name had already occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>.

But the more exact statements of the Chronicle as to the preparations and the results of this war and victory are important for Amaziah's later war with Kings Joash of Israel, which is narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-17.htm">2 Chronicles 25:17</a>. of our chapter, because in them lie the causes of that war, so fatal to Amaziah; so that the history of Amaziah is essentially supplemented by those statements of the Chronicle which are not found in 2Kings.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5-7</a><p>The preparations for the war against Edom, and the victory over the Edomites in the Valley of Salt. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>. Amaziah assembled Judah, i.e., the men in his kingdom capable of bearing arms, and set them up (ordered them) according to the princes of thousands and hundreds, of all Judah and Benjamin, and passed them in review, i.e., caused a census to be taken of the men liable to military service from twenty years old and upward. They found 300,000 warriors "bearing spear and target" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-7.htm">2 Chronicles 14:7</a>); a relatively small number, not merely in comparison with the numbers under Jehoshaphat, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14</a>., which are manifestly too large, but also with the numberings made by other kings, e.g., Asa, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-7.htm">2 Chronicles 14:7</a>. By Joram's unfortunate wars, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>, those of Ahaziah, and especially by the defeat which Joash sustained from the Syrians, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>, the number of men in Judah fit for war may have been very much reduced. Amaziah accordingly sought to strengthen his army against the Edomites, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-6.htm">2 Chronicles 25:6</a>, by having an auxiliary corps of 100,000 men from Israel (of the ten tribes) for 100 talents of silver, i.e., he took them into his pay. But a prophet advised him not to take the Israelitish host with him, because Jahve was not with Israel, viz., on account of their defection from Jahve by the introduction of the calf-worship. To Israel there is added, (with) all the sons of Ephraim, to guard against any misunderstanding.</body></html>
