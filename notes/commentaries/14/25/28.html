A man's pride will bring him low, Pr 29:23; it goes before his destruction, and deservedly brings it on. He that exalteth himself shall be abased. He that goes forth hastily to strive, will not know what he shall do in the end thereof, when his neighbour has put him to shame, Pr 25:8. And what are we when we offer to establish our own righteousness, or presume to justify ourselves before the Most High God, but despicable thistles, that fancy themselves stately cedars? And are not various temptations, is not every corruption, a wild beast of the desert, which will trample on the wretched boaster, and tread his haughty pretensions to the dust? A man's pride shall bring him low; his ruin may be dated from his turning from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After the time ... - The writer means that the violent death of Amaziah followed on his apostasy, not closely in point of time - for it must have been at least 15 years after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-25.htm">2 Chronicles 25:25</a> - nor as, humanly speaking, caused by it; but, in the way of a divine judgment, his death was a complete fulfillment of the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-16.htm">2 Chronicles 25:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 25:17.
