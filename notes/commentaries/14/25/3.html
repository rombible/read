Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This chapter is evidently taken to a large extent from the same document as Kings (see the marginal reference and the notes).

This is kal conjugation of the verb, which we found in piel in ver. 5 of foregoing chapter, and there rendered "repair." The kal force of the word is simply to "be strong" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a>). The hiph., to "make strong," or "confirm," as it is rendered here, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>. Again and again the disorders of the kingdom and the violent deaths of prophets and kings must have greatly contributed to nervous apprehensions, in fact only too just, when a new king ascended the throne. In the parallel and in passage last quoted the words, "in his hand," follow the verb. Amaziah both needed to get his own hand in, according to modern phrase, and to get things well into his hand. <span class="cmt_word">His servants</span>. It may be held surprising that they should have been found "in the <span class="accented">place</span>," or should now be <span class="accented">his servants</span> at all. The explanation may be either that their guilt had not yet been known, or, if <span class="accented">known</span>, had not been fixed upon them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The punishment comes upon them. Joash afflicted by the invasion of Judah by Hazael the Syrian; and his death in consequence of a conspiracy against him. - These two events are narrated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18-21</a> also, the progress of Hazael's invasion being more exactly traced; see the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a>. The author of the Chronicle brings forward only those parts of it which show how God punished Joash for his defection from Him.<p>"At the revolution of a year," i.e., scarcely a year after the murder of the prophet Zechariah, a Syrian army invaded Judah and advanced upon Jerusalem; "and they destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people," i.e., they smote the army of Joash in a battle, in which the princes (the chief and leaders) were destroyed, i.e., partly slain, partly wounded. This punishment came upon the princes as the originators of the defection from the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17</a>. "And they sent all their booty to the king (Hazael) to Damascus." In this booty the treasures which Joash gave to the Syrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a>) to buy their withdrawal are also included. In order to show that this invasion of the Syrians was a divine judgment, it is remarked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-24.htm">2 Chronicles 24:24</a> that the Syrians, with a small army, gained a victory over the very large army of Judah, and executed judgment upon Joash. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-4.htm">Numbers 33:4</a>, frequently in Ezekiel, usually construed with &#1489;&#1468;, here with &#1488;&#1514;, analogous to the &#1488;&#1514; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-19.htm">1 Samuel 24:19</a>. These words refer to the wounding of Joash, and its results, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>. In the war Joash was badly wounded; the Syrians on their withdrawal had left him behind in many wounds (&#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; only met with here, synonymous with &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-19.htm">2 Chronicles 21:19</a>). Then his own servants, the court officials named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-26.htm">2 Chronicles 24:26</a>, conspired against him, and smote him upon his bed. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-21.htm">2 Kings 12:21</a>, the place where the king, lying sick upon his bed, was slain is stated. He met with his end thus, "because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest" which had been shed. The plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; is perhaps only an orthographical error for &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, occasioned by the preceding &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497; (Berth.); but more probably it is, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>, a rhetorical plural, which says nothing as to the number, but only brings out that Joash had brought blood-guiltiness upon himself in respect of the children of his benefactor Jehoiada; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>. Upon the murdered king, moreover, the honour of being buried in the graves of the kings was not bestowed; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>. On the names of the two conspirators, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-26.htm">2 Chronicles 24:26</a>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-21.htm">2 Kings 12:21</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-27.htm">2 Chronicles 24:27</a> it is doubtful how &#1493;&#1512;&#1489; is to be read. The Keri demands &#1497;&#1512;&#1489;, which Berth. understands thus: And as regards his sons, may the utterance concerning him increase; which might signify, "May the wish of the dying Zechariah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">2 Chronicles 24:22</a>, be fulfilled on them in a still greater degree than on their father." But that is hardly the meaning of the Keri. The older theologians took &#1497;&#1512;&#1489; relatively: et quam creverit s. multiplicatum fuerit. Without doubt, the Keth. &#1493;&#1512;&#1489; or &#1493;&#1512;&#1489; is the correct reading. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, too, is variously interpreted. Vulg., Luther, and others take it to be synonymous with &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-6.htm">2 Chronicles 24:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-9.htm">2 Chronicles 24:9</a>, and understand it of the money derived from Moses' tax; but to that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is by no means suitable. Others (as Then.) think of the tribute laid upon him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a>, but very arbitrarily. On the other hand, Clericus and others rightly understand it of prophetic threatenings against him, corresponding to the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-19.htm">2 Chronicles 24:19</a>, that God sent prophets against him. As to the Midrash of the book of Kings, see the Introduction. </body></html>
