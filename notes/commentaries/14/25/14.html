Esarhaddon states that he restored the gods of Hazael, king of Arabia, at that prince’s entreaty, after engraving on them “the might of Asshur” and his own name.

Thenius says this contradicts <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-3.htm" title="And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.">2Kings 14:3</a>; and it may be allowed that the chronicler portrays Amaziah in a darker light than the older account. This only proves independence of judgment and the possession of additional information. Thenius and Bertheau further suppose that the chronicler, from his theocratic standpoint, merely <span class= "ital">inferred</span> the idolatry of Amaziah from his ill success against Israel. It is more likely that it was mentioned in one of the histories which the compiler had before him.<p><span class= "bld">Bowed down himself.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">And before them would he bow himself, and to them would he offer incense;</span> relating his habitual practice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm" title="Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.">2 Chronicles 25:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">He brought the gods of Seir, and set them up for his gods — </span>Egregious folly!

But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>,) he had some little colour for it, as he hoped, probably, thus to prevail upon them to assist him too. But for Amaziah to worship the gods of those he had conquered, was surely most unreasonable. What did he see in the gods of the children of Seir, that could tempt him to set them up for <span class="ital">his gods, and bow down himself before them? </span>If he had cast the idols down from the rock, and broken them to pieces, instead of the prisoners, he would have discovered more of the piety, as well as more of the pity, of an Israelite. But, perhaps, as a punishment for that barbarous inhumanity, he was given up to this ridiculous idolatry.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:14-16 To worship the gods of those whom Amaziah had conquered, who could not help their own worshippers, was the greatest absurdity. If men would consider how unable all those things are to help them, to which they look whenever they forsake God, they would not be such enemies to themselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to be answered; themselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to be answered; but he was bidden not to say a word more. The secure sinner rejoices to have silenced his reprovers and monitors; but what comes of it? Those that are deaf to reproof, are ripening for destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The practice of carrying off the images of the gods from a conquered country, or city, as trophies of victory, was common among the nations of the East.

Amaziah &#8230; brought the gods of the children of Seir&#8212;The Edomites worshipped the sun under different forms and with various rites. But burning incense upon altars was a principal act of worship, and this was the very thing Amaziah is described as having with strange infatuation performed. Whether he had been captivated with the beauty of the images, or hoped by honoring the gods to disarm their spite at him for his conquest and harsh treatment of their votaries, his conduct in establishing these objects of religious homage in Jerusalem was foolish, ignorant, and highly offensive to God, who commissioned a prophet to rebuke him for his apostasy, and threaten him with the calamity that soon after befell him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites,....

The act was according to a policy frequently pursued in ancient times. Solomon affords an instance of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brought the gods of the children</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Seir...  to be his gods.</span> Amaziah's devout gratitude to God, and acknowledgment of him in the name Joktheel, was soon gone, and at the very last, grown confident, he loses all, and realizes the fulfilment of the "man of God's" prophetic denunciations. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Amaziah is to go alone, and show himself valiant in war, and the Lord will help him to conquer. This is without doubt the thought in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-8.htm">2 Chronicles 25:8</a>, which, however, does not seem to be contained in the traditional Masoretic text. &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; can hardly, after the preceding imperatives - do, be strong for battle - be otherwise translated than by, "and God will cause thee to stumble before the enemy." But this is quite unsuitable. Clericus, therefore, would take the words ironically: sin minus, tu vadito, etc.; i.e., if thou dost not follow my advice, and takest the Israelites with thee to the war, go, show thyself strong for the war, God will soon cause thee to stumble. But &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; can never signify sin minus. Others, as Schmidt and Ramb., translate: Rather do thou go alone (without the Israelitish auxiliaries), and be valiant, alioquin enim, si illos tecum duxeris, corruere te faciet Deus; or, May God make thee fall before the enemy (De Wette). But the supplying of alioquin, which is only hidden by De Wette's translation, cannot be grammatically justified. This interpretation of the &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; would be possible only if the negation &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; stood in the preceding clause and &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; was joined to it by &#1493;. The traditional text is clearly erroneous, and we must, with Ewald and Berth., supply a &#1500;&#1488; or &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; before &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498;: God thou (alone), do, be valiant for battle, and God will not let thee come to ruin.<p>(Note: Even the old translators could make nothing of the present text, and expressed the first clause of the verse as they thought best. lxx, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; Vulg., quod si putes in robore exercitus bella consistere; after which Luth., "denn so du komest das du eine knheit beweisest im streit, wird Gott dich fallen lassen fr deinen Feinden.")<p>After this we have very fittingly the reason assigned: "for with God there is power to help, and to cause to fall." </body></html>
