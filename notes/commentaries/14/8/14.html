The difficulty is increased, when a man has a hinderance instead of a help meet in the wife of his bosom. Solomon kept up the holy sacrifices, according to the law of Moses. In vain had the altar been built, in vain had fire come down from heaven, if sacrifices had not been constantly brought. Spiritual sacrifices are required of us, which we are to bring daily and weekly; it is good to be in a settled method of devotion. When the service of the temple was put into good order, it is said, The house of the Lord was perfected. The work was the main matter, not the place; the temple was unfinished till all this was done. Canaan was a rich country, and yet must send to Ophir for gold The Israelites were a wise people, but must be beholden to the king of Tyre for men that had knowledge of the seas. Grace, and not gold, is the best riches, and acquaintance with God and his law, the best knowledge. Leaving the children of this world to scramble for the toys of this world, may we, as the children of God, lay up our treasure in heaven, that where our treasure is, our hearts also may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The man of God - This phrase, so common in Kings (see the introduction to Kings, 4th note), is rare in Chronicles, and is applied only to Moses <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-14.htm">1 Chronicles 23:14</a>, David, and one other prophet <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-7.htm">2 Chronicles 25:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-9.htm">2 Chronicles 25:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

While that palace was in progress, he himself lodged in the palace of David, but he did not allow her to occupy it, because he felt that she being a heathen proselyte, and having brought from her own country an establishment of heathen maid-servants, there would have been an impropriety in her being domiciled in a mansion which was or had been hallowed by the reception of the ark. It seems she was received on her arrival into his mother's abode (So 3:4; 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The man of God, </span> i.e. a prophet inspired by God in these matters, whose commands therefore are the commands of God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service,....
