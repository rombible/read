In Kings it stands in more obvious connection with what precedes; for there the account of Solomon’s buildings is headed by the words, “And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, for to build the house of the Lord,” &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1Kings 9:15</a>).<p>(7) <span class= "bld">As for all the people that were left.</span>—The verse agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,">1Kings 9:20</a>.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">But.</span>—Omit.

The Heb. text has the relative (<span class= "ital">‘asher</span>) after “children of Israel.” But some few MSS., and the ancient versions, omit it.

Sic. i. 56, Sesostris (Rameses II.), the great Egyptian monarch, was wont to inscribe over the temples he built, “No native hath laboured hereon.”<p>After “men of war,” Kings adds, “and his servants,” which is omitted here as unsuitable, after the preceding statement. It means, however, courtiers and officers.<p><span class= "bld">Chief of his captains.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">captains of his knights;</span> which appears to be incorrect.

The difficulty is increased, when a man has a hinderance instead of a help meet in the wife of his bosom. Solomon kept up the holy sacrifices, according to the law of Moses. In vain had the altar been built, in vain had fire come down from heaven, if sacrifices had not been constantly brought. Spiritual sacrifices are required of us, which we are to bring daily and weekly; it is good to be in a settled method of devotion. When the service of the temple was put into good order, it is said, The house of the Lord was perfected. The work was the main matter, not the place; the temple was unfinished till all this was done. Canaan was a rich country, and yet must send to Ophir for gold The Israelites were a wise people, but must be beholden to the king of Tyre for men that had knowledge of the seas. Grace, and not gold, is the best riches, and acquaintance with God and his law, the best knowledge. Leaving the children of this world to scramble for the toys of this world, may we, as the children of God, lay up our treasure in heaven, that where our treasure is, our hearts also may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Built - "Rebuilt," or "repaired" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>).

The parallel charitably "whom the children of Israel were not able to destroy utterly," where our text shows with exacter fidelity, <span class="cmt_word">whom the children of Israel consumed not</span>. The parallel also uses the words, "levy a tribute of <span class="accented">bond</span>-<span class="accented">service</span>," for our more ambiguous <span class="cmt_word">make to pay tribute</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-7</a>). In the words, <span class="cmt_word">until this day</span>, the copyist, shall we say, too slavish, is again detected (ver. 9). The "levy "in <span class="accented">ver.</span> 21 of the parallel probably explains the suddenly mentioned similar language of its fifteenth verse, and again betrays the collected and copied nature of the historic material, the carefulness of sequence not being as observable in selection as might be desired. The distinction between the remnant of aliens and the people of Israel was manifestly that the <span class="accented">menial</span> and the laborious service was put on the former. Useful but familiar references to this whole subject are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>. For our <span class="cmt_word">two hundred and fifty</span> (which gives the number of overseers over Israelites only) the parallel reads, "five hundred and fifty." It will be remembered that an analogous difference occurs between our <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-16.htm">1 Kings 5:16</a>. Whether it were the determining reason or not in these two places, it is very imaginable that it would be of less importance in the ages of the post-Captivity annalist to dwell on the minutiae of the different treatment of the aliens. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The city-building. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-1.htm">2 Chronicles 8:1</a>.
