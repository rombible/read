The writer of Kings only tells us in general terms that Jehoram "did evil in the sight of the Lord," and "walked in the way of the house of Ahab." Here, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-13.htm">2 Chronicles 21:13</a>, we have particulars of his idolatry. Jehoram, it seems, seduced by the evil influence of his wife - Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab - permitted the introduction of Baal-worship, idolatrous altars in various high places, groves (Asherahs), images, and pillars; the people were not only allowed, but compelled to take part in the new rites. "To commit fornication" is a common metaphor, signifying idolatry or spiritual unfaithfulness (compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 21:8-17.

But that king having been slain in an insurrection at home, his successor thought to ingratiate himself with his new subjects by raising the flag of independence [Josephus]. The attempt was defeated in the first instance by Jehoram, who possessed all the military establishments of his father; but being renewed unexpectedly, the Edomites succeeded in completely emancipating their country from the yoke of Judah (Ge 27:40).
