But that king having been slain in an insurrection at home, his successor thought to ingratiate himself with his new subjects by raising the flag of independence [Josephus]. The attempt was defeated in the first instance by Jehoram, who possessed all the military establishments of his father; but being renewed unexpectedly, the Edomites succeeded in completely emancipating their country from the yoke of Judah (Ge 27:40). Libnah, which lay on the southern frontier and towards Edom, followed the example of that country.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jehoram was thirty two years old,....

The Heb. root rendered “pass over” means (<span class="ital">a</span>) to pass over a sea or river or other landmark, (<span class="ital">b</span>) to pass by persons. In the latter signification it is applied (as here) to the vanguard of an army which <span class="ital">passes by</span> the main body in order to take the lead; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-7.htm" title="And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.">Joshua 6:7</a>. In this case Jehoram pushed on with the vanguard (consisting of all his chariots) leaving the “people” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm" title="So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.">2 Kings 8:21</a>), i.e. the bulk of his army to follow. A disaster ensued. Jehoram was hemmed in by the Edomites, and though he cut his way through them by a night surprise, his success came too late, for the rest of the army, thinking that the vanguard was cut off, dispersed to their homes. This last fact, which explains the failure of the campaign, is omitted by the Chronicler. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm" title="So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.">2 Kings 8:21</a> should read, <span class="ital">And it came to pass, though he rose by night and smote the Edomites … that the people fled to their tents</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with his princes</span>] In 2 Kin. <span class="ital">to Zair</span>.

The parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a>, reads, "to Zair." Of any such place nothing is known, and it has been proposed to supersede the word there by "Self," which a certain amount of similarity of the Hebrew characters might countenance. Possibly by some mishap, not so readily explainable by misoccurrence of characters simply, our words, "with his princes," should stand in place of "to Zair." It must be noted that the two first clauses of the verse in the parallel become something inconsequential (which is not the case with the reading of our text), in that it says, "The king and chariots went forth to a place, and rose up by night," etc. The dislocation is, perhaps, not serious, but our text avoids it in reading, "The king, princes, and chariots went forth, and rose up by night and smote," etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehoshaphat's death, and the slaughter of his sons by Joram. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-3.htm">2 Chronicles 21:3</a>. Joram had six brothers, whom their father had plentifully supplied with means of subsistence - presents in silver, gold, and precious things - "in the fenced cities of Judah;" i.e., he had made them, as Rehoboam also had made his sons, commandants of fortresses, with ample revenues; but the kingdom he gave to Joram as the first-born. Among the six names two Azariah's occur, - the one written Azarjah, the other Azarjahu. Jehoshaphat is called king of Israel instead of king of Judah, because he as king walked in the footsteps of Israel, Jacob the wrestler with God, and was a true king of God's people.</body></html>
