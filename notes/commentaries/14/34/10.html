Happy and wise are those who seek the Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others are pursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinous connexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, and its blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness will convince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, and the sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselves before God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are here taught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them away from the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripens them for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for their reformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tide of affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those that are dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in the grace the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know and to love the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visited you? Can you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, like Josiah, from your youth?

In the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a youth, being then only sixteen years old, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David, and in the twelfth year of his reign he commenced to purify Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, Asherim, etc. The cleansing of the land of Judah from the numerous objects of idolatry is summarily described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-5.htm">2 Chronicles 34:5</a>; and thereupon there follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-7.htm">2 Chronicles 34:7</a>) the destruction of the idolatrous altars and images in the land of Israel, - all that it seemed necessary to say on that subject being thus mentioned at once. For that all this was not accomplished in the twelfth year is clear from the &#1500;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512; &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;, "he commenced to cleanse," and is moreover attested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>. The description of this destruction of the various objects of idolatry is rhetorically expressed, only carved and cast images being mentioned, besides the altars of the high places and the Asherim, without the enumeration of the different kings of idolatry which we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-20</a>. - On <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>. &#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1468;, they pulled down before him, i.e., under his eye, or his oversight, the altars of the Baals (these are the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>); and the sun-pillars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-4.htm">2 Chronicles 14:4</a>) which stood upwards, i.e., above, upon the altars, he caused to be hewn away from them (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;); the Asherim (pillars and trees of Asherah) and the carved and molten images to be broken and ground (&#1492;&#1491;&#1511;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>), and (the dust of them) to be strewn upon the graves (of those) who had sacrificed to them. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; is connected directly with &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, so that the actions of those buried in them are poetically attributed to the graves. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a> this is said only of the ashes of the Asherah statue which was burnt, while here it is rhetorically generalized. </body></html>
