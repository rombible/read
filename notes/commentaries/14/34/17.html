Happy and wise are those who seek the Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others are pursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinous connexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, and its blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness will convince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, and the sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselves before God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are here taught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them away from the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripens them for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for their reformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tide of affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those that are dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in the grace the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know and to love the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visited you? Can you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, like Josiah, from your youth? Oh the unspeakable happiness of becoming acquainted with Jesus from our earliest years!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of the Levites there were scribes - Hereto the word "scribe" has never been used to designate a class (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>). But here an order of scribes, forming a distinct division of the Levitical body, has been instituted. The class itself probably originated in the reign of Hezekiah (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>); and it is probably to the rise of this class that we are indebted for the preservation of so many prophecies belonging to Hezekiah's time, while the works of almost all previous prophets - Ahijah, Iddo, Shemaiah, Jehu, the son of Hanani, and probably many others - have perished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 34:8-18.

The Keri &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is a correction resulting from a misinterpretation of the Keth. &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;, "and of the dwellers in Jerusalem." The enumeration, "from the hand of Manasseh, Ephraim," etc., is rhetorical. In &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-10.htm">2 Chronicles 34:10</a>, the verb of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a> is again taken up: they handed it to the overseers of the building, and they to the workmen. &#1492;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is a rare form of the plur. &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>. The overseers of the building (&#1492;&#1502;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; - &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;) are the subject of the second &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;; and before the following &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1500;, which stands in 2 Kings, is to be supplied. &#1489;&#1491;&#1493;&#1511; is a denom. from &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1511;, and signifies to repair what has been damaged. The statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-10.htm">2 Chronicles 34:10</a> is made more definite by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-11.htm">2 Chronicles 34:11</a> : they gave it, namely, to the workers in stone and wood, and to the builders to buy hewn stones and timber for couplings, and for the beams of the houses (&#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, to provide with beams; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; are the various buildings of the temple and its courts), which the kings of Judah had allowed to decay (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, not of designed destroying, but of ruining by neglect). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-12.htm">2 Chronicles 34:12</a> we have still the remark that the people did the work with fidelity, and the money could consequently be given to them without reckoning, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-7.htm">2 Kings 22:7</a>; and then the names of the building inspectors follow. Two Levites of the family of Merari, and two of the family of Kohath, were overseers; &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;, i.e., to lead in the building, to preside over it as upper overseers; and besides them, the Levites, all who were skilled in instruments of song (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-6.htm">1 Chronicles 25:6</a>.). As men who by their office and their art occupied a conspicuous place among the Levites, the oversight of the workmen in the temple was committed to them, not "that they might incite and cheer the workmen by music and song" (Berth.).</body></html>
