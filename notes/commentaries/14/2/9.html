The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a>, note.<p>Purple ... - "Purple, crimson, and blue," would be needed for the hangings of the temple, which, in this respect, as in others, was conformed to the pattern of the tabernacle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, etc.). Hiram's power of "working in purple, crimson," etc., was probably a knowledge of the best modes of dyeing cloth these colors. The Phoenicians, off whose coast the murex was commonly taken, were famous as purple dyers from a very remote period.<p>Crimson - &#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1500;  karm&#305;&#770;&#770;yl, the word here and elsewhere translated "crimson," is unique to Chronicles and probably of Persian origin.

Solomon, through his ambassadors, addressed himself to Huram king of Tyre, with the request that he would send him an architect and building wood for the temple. On the Tyrian king Huram or Hiram, the contemporary of David and Solomon, see the discussion on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>. According to the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5</a>, Solomon asked cedar wood from Lebanon from Hiram; according to our account, which is more exact, he desired an architect, and cedar, cypress, and other wood. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5</a> the motive of Solomon's request is given in the communication to Hiram, viz., that David could not carry out the building of the proposed temple on account of his wars, but that Jahve had given him (Solomon) rest and peace, so that he now, in accordance with the divine promise to David, desired to carry on the building (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-3.htm">1 Kings 5:3-5</a>). In the <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-2.htm">2 Chronicles 2:2-5</a>, on the contrary, Solomon reminds the Tyrian king of the friendliness with which he had supplied his father David with cedar wood for his palace, and then announces to him his purpose to build a temple to the Lord, at the same time stating that it was designed for the worship of God, whom the heavens and the earth cannot contain. It is clear, therefore, that both authors have expanded the fundamental thoughts of their authority in somewhat freer fashion. The apodosis of the clause beginning with &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is wanting, and the sentence is an anacolouthon. The apodosis should be: "do so also for me, and send me cedars." This latter clause follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-7.htm">2 Chronicles 2:7</a>, while the first can easily be supplied, as is done e.g., in the Vulg., by sic fac mecum.</body></html>
