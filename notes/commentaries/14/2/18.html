The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the numbers, see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-16.htm">1 Kings 5:16</a> note.<p>To set the people a work - Or, "to set the people to work" - i. e., to compel them to labor.

The explanation probably is that of the 3600 "stranger" overseers, the small proportion of 300 were of much higher grade in office than the rest, and were ranked by the writer in Kings with those overseers (250) of Solomon, who were probably Israelites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The answer of King Hiram; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7-11</a>. - Hiram answered &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;, in a writing, a letter, which he sent to Solomon. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a> Hiram first expresses his joy at Solomon's request, because it was of importance to him to be on a friendly footing with the king of Israel. In the Chronicle his writing begins with the congratulation: because Jahve loveth His people, hath He made thee king over them. Cf. for the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>. He then, according to both narratives, praises God that He has given David so wise a son. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a>, means: then he said further. The praise of God is heightened in the Chronicle by Hiram's entering into Solomon's religious ideas, calling Jahve the Creator of heaven and earth. Then, further, &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; is strengthened by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, having understanding and discernment; and this predicate is specially referred to Solomon's resolve to build a temple to the Lord. Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>. he promises to send Solomon the artificer Huram-Abi. On the title &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, my father, i.e., minister, counsellor, and the descent of this man, cf. the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13-14</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a> of the Chronicle his artistic skill is described in terms coinciding with Solomon's wish in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>, only heightened by small additions. To the metals as materials in which he could work, there are added stone and wood work, and to the woven fabrics &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (byssus), the later word for &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;; and finally, to exhaust the whole, he is said to be able &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495; &#1493;&#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to devise all manner of devices which shall be put to him, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>, he being thus raised to the level of Bezaleel, the chief artificer of the tabernacle. &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; is dependent upon &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>. The promise to send cedars and cypresses is for the sake of brevity here omitted, and only indirectly indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-15.htm">2 Chronicles 2:15</a>, however, it is mentioned that Hiram accepted the promised supply of grain, wine, and oil for the labourers; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a> closes with the promise to fell the wood required in Lebanon, and to cause it to be sent in floats to Joppa (Jaffa), whence Solomon could take it up to Jerusalem. The word &#1510;&#1512;&#1498;, "need," is a &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. in the Old Testament, but is very common in Aramaic writings. &#1512;&#1508;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, "floats," too, occurs only here instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>, and its etymology is unknown. If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-16</a> with the parallel account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8-11</a>, we find that, besides Hiram's somewhat verbose promise to fell the desired quantity of cedars and cypresses on Lebanon, and to send them in floats by sea to the place appointed by Solomon, the latter contains a request from Hiram that Solomon would give him &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, maintenance for his house, and a concluding remark that Hiram sent Solomon cedar wood, while Solomon gave Hiram, year by year, 20,000 kor of wheat as food for his house, i.e., the royal household, and twenty kor beaten oil, that is, of the finest oil. In the book of Kings, therefore, the promised wages of grain, wine, and oil, which were sent to the Tyrian woodcutters, is passed over, and only the quantity of wheat and finest oil which Solomon gave to the Tyrian king for his household, year by year, in return for the timber sent, is mentioned. In the Chronicle, on the contrary, only the wages or payment to the woodcutters is mentioned, and the return made for the building timber is not spoken of; but there is no reason for bringing these two passages, which treat of different things, into harmony by alterations of the text. For further discussion of this and of the measures, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>. </body></html>
