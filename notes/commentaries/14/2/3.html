Whether the Tyrian name <span class= "ital">Sirōmos</span> (Herod. vii. 98) is another form of Hiram, as Bertheau supposes, is more than doubtful. It is interesting to find that the king of Tyre bore this name in the time of Tiglath-pileser II., to whom he paid tribute (B.C. 738), along with Menahem of Samaria.

The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Huram, the form used throughout Chronicles (except <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>) for the name both of the king and of the artisan whom he lent to Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-16.htm">2 Chronicles 4:16</a>, is a late corruption of the true native word, Hiram (marginal note and reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 2:3-10. His Message to Huram for Skilful Artificers.<p>3-6. Solomon sent to Huram&#8212;The correspondence was probably conducted on both sides in writing (2Ch 2:11; also see on [407]1Ki 5:8).<p>As thou didst deal with David my father&#8212;This would seem decisive of the question whether the Huram then reigning in Tyre was David's friend (see on [408]1Ki 5:1-6). In opening the business, Solomon grounded his request for Tyrian aid on two reasons: 1. The temple he proposed to build must be a solid and permanent building because the worship was to be continued in perpetuity; and therefore the building materials must be of the most durable quality. 2. It must be a magnificent structure because it was to be dedicated to the God who was greater than all gods; and, therefore, as it might seem a presumptuous idea to erect an edifice for a Being "whom the heaven and the heaven of heavens do not contain," it was explained that Solomon's object was not to build a house for Him to dwell in, but a temple in which His worshippers might offer sacrifices to His honor. No language could be more humble and appropriate than this.

So the name is spelt, whether of Tyrian king or Tyrian workman, in Chronicles, except, perhaps, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>. Elsewhere the name is written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, or sometimes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>.

The Septuagint write the name <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>; the Alexandrian, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Hiram.</span> The name of Hiram's father was Abibaal. Hiram himself began to reign, according to Menander, when nineteen years of age, reigned thirty-four years (B.C. 1023-990), and died therefore at the age of fifty-three. Of Hiram and his reign in Tyre very little is known beyond what is so familiar to us from the Bible history of David and Solomon. The city of Tyre is among the most ancient. Though it is not mentioned in Homer, yet the Sidonians, who lived in such close connection with the Tyrians, are mentioned there ('Iliad.,' 6:290; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:84; 22:424), whilst Virgil calls Tyre the Sidonian city, Sidon being twenty miles distant ('AEn.,' 1:12, 677; 4:545). The modern name of Tyre is <span class="accented">Sur.</span> The city was situate on the east coast of the Mediterranean, in Phoenicia, about seventy-four geographical miles north of Joppa, while the road distance from Joppa to Jerusalem was thirty-two miles. The first Bible mention of Tyre is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>. After that the more characteristic mentions of it are <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>, with all its parallels; 2 Samuel 24:7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-2.htm">Ezekiel 26:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-1.htm">Ezekiel 27:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-2.htm">Zechariah 9:2, 3</a>. Tyre was celebrated for its working in copper and brass, and by no means only for its cedar and timber felling. The good terms and intimacy subsisting between Solomon and the King of Tyre speak themselves very plainly in Bible history, without leaving us dependent on doubtful history, or tales of such as Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:05. &sect; 3; 'Contra Apion,' 1:17). For the timber, metals, workmen, given by Hiram to Solomon, Solomon gave to Hiram corn and oil, ceded to him some cities, and the use of some ports on the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14, 25-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21-23</a>.

In our Chronicle, on the contrary, we have in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14-17</a> only a short statement as to his chariots and horses, and the wealth in silver and gold to be found in the land, merely for the purpose of showing how God had given him riches and possessions. This statement recurs verbally in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>, in the concluding remarks on the riches and splendour of Solomon's reign; while in the parallel passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-13.htm">2 Chronicles 9:13-28</a>, it is repeated in an abridged form, and interwoven with other statements. From this we see in how free and peculiar a manner the author of the Chronicle has made use of his authorities, and how he has arranged the material derived from them according to his own special plan.<p>(Note: The assertion of Thenius on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>., that he found this section in his authorities in two different places and in different connections, copied them mechanically, and only towards the end of the second passage remarked the repetition and then abridged the statement, is at once refuted by observing, that in the supposed repetition the first half (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25-26</a>) does not at all agree with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>, but coincides with the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6-7</a>.)<p>For the commentary on this section, see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-28</a>.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14-15</a><p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a>, with the exception of one divergence in form and one in matter, correspond word for word to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>.

It is, however, very suitable in this connection, since the comparison "like stones" has reference to quantity, and Solomon had collected not only silver, but also gold, in quantity.</body></html>
