The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This passage is very nearly identical with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>2Ch 2:1, 2.

This statement is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm" title="And Solomon had three score and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;">1 Kings 5:15</a> which distinguishes them from the levy of 30,000 hewers raised out of all Israel (<span class="ital">ib</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm" title="And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.">1 Kings 5:13</a>). The 30,000 Israelites were subject to a corvée of one month in every three, the 150,000 aliens were apparently always at work.

The contents of this verse will therefore be considered with vers. 17, 18. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The divine promise. Here &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is strengthened by the addition &#1504;&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, treasures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, ut judicare possis. In general, the mode of expression is briefer than in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-11.htm">1 Kings 3:11-13</a>, and the conditional promise, "long life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>), is omitted, because Solomon did not fulfil the condition, and the promise was not fulfilled. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a> &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is unintelligible, and has probably come into our text only by a backward glance at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, instead of &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, which the contents demand, and as the lxx and Vulgate have rightly translated it. The addition, "from before the tabernacle," which seems superfluous after the preceding "from the Bamah at Gibeon," is inserted in order again to point to the place of sacrifice at Gibeon, and to the legal validity of the sacrifices offered there (Berth.). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-15.htm">1 Kings 3:15</a>, Solomon, on his return to Jerusalem, offered before the ark still other burnt-offerings and thank-offerings, and prepared a meal for his servants. This is omitted by the author of the Chronicle, because these sacrifices had no ultimate import for Solomon's reign, and not, as Then, supposes, because in his view only the sacrifices offered on the ancient brazen altar of burnt-offering belonging to the temple had legal validity. For he narrates at length in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-18.htm">1 Chronicles 21:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>. how God Himself directed David to sacrifice in Jerusalem, and how the sacrifice offered there was graciously accepted by fire from heaven, and the threshing-floor of Araunah thereby consecrated as a place of sacrifice; and it is only with the purpose of explaining to his readers why Solomon offered the solemn burnt-offering in Gibeon, and not, as we should have expected from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a>, in Jerusalem, that he is so circumstantial in his statements as to the tabernacle. The last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a>, "and he was king over Israel," does not belong to the section treating of the sacrifice at Gibeon, but corresponds to the remark in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-1.htm">1 Kings 4:1</a>, and forms the transition to what follows. </body></html>
