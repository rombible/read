Idols are nothing, princes are little, and both are under the control of the God of Israel. Therefore the house must be great; not indeed in proportion to the greatness of that God to whom it is to be dedicated, for between finite and infinite there can be no proportion; but in some proportion to the exalted conceptions we have of him, and the great esteem we have for him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-18 Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty with Huram. - Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed in the temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a> note. In Jewish eyes, at the time that the temple was built, it may have been "great," that is to say, it may have exceeded the dimensions of any single separate building existing in Palestine up to the time of its erection.<p>Great is our God ... - This may seem inappropriate as addressed to a pagan king. But it appears <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11-12</a> that Hiram acknowledged Yahweh as the supreme deity, probably identifying Him with his own Melkarth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 2:3-10. His Message to Huram for Skilful Artificers.<p>3-6. Solomon sent to Huram&#8212;The correspondence was probably conducted on both sides in writing (2Ch 2:11; also see on [407]1Ki 5:8).<p>As thou didst deal with David my father&#8212;This would seem decisive of the question whether the Huram then reigning in Tyre was David's friend (see on [408]1Ki 5:1-6). In opening the business, Solomon grounded his request for Tyrian aid on two reasons: 1. The temple he proposed to build must be a solid and permanent building because the worship was to be continued in perpetuity; and therefore the building materials must be of the most durable quality. 2. It must be a magnificent structure because it was to be dedicated to the God who was greater than all gods; and, therefore, as it might seem a presumptuous idea to erect an edifice for a Being "whom the heaven and the heaven of heavens do not contain," it was explained that Solomon's object was not to build a house for Him to dwell in, but a temple in which His worshippers might offer sacrifices to His honor. No language could be more humble and appropriate than this. The pious strain of sentiment was such as became a king of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The house which I build is great; </span> for though the temple strictly so called, was but small, yet the buildings belonging to it, both above and under ground, were large and numerous. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the house which I build is great,....

To find a place for <span class="accented">this</span> subject amid his careful selection, and rejection in many cases, of the matter at his command, is certainly a decision in harmony with his general design in this work. Then, again, they may be remarked on as spoken to another king, who, whether it were to be expected or no, was, it is plain, a sympathizing hearer of the piety and religious resolution of Solomon (ver. 12). This is one of the touches of history that does not diminish our regret that we do not know more of Hiram. He was no "proselyte," but he had the sympathy of a convert to the religion of the Jew. Perhaps the simplest and most natural explanation may just be the truest, that Hiram for some long time had seen "the rising" kingdom, and alike in David and Solomon in turn, "the coming" men. He had been more calmly and deliberately impressed than the Queen of Sheba afterwards, but not less effectually and operatively impressed. And once more the passage is noteworthy for the utterances of Solomon in themselves. As parenthetically testifying to a powerful man, who could be a powerful helper of Solomon's enterprise, his outburst of explanation, and of ardent religious purpose, and of humble godly awe, is natural. But that he should call the temple he purposed to build "so great," as we cannot put it down either to intentional exaggeration or to sober historic fact, must the rather be honestly set down to such considerations as these, viz. that in point of fact, neither David nor Solomon were "travelled men," as Joseph and Moses, for instance. Their measures of greatness were largely dependent upon the existing material and furnishing of their own little country. And further, Solomon speaks of the temple as great very probably from the point of view of its simple religious uses (note end of ver. 6) as the place of sacrifice in especial rather than as a place, for instance, of vast congregations and vast processions. Then, too, as compared with the tabernacle, it would loom "great," whether for size or for its enduring material. Meantime, though Solomon does indeed use the words (ver. 5)," The house.., is great," yet, throwing on the words the light of the remaining clause of the verse, and of David's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, it is not very certain that the main thing present to his mind was <span class="accented">not</span> the size, but rather the <span class="accented">character</span> of the house, and the solemn character of the <span class="accented">enterprise</span> itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-18.htm">2 Chronicles 6:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who am I...  save only to burn sacrifice before him?</span> The drift of Solomon's thought is plain - that nothing would justify mortal man, if he purported to build really a palace of residence for him whom the heaven of heavens could not contain, but that he is justified all the more in "not giving sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he had found out a place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4, 5</a>) where man might acceptably, in God's <span class="accented">appointed way</span>, draw near to him. If "earth draw near to heaven," it may be confidently depended on that heaven will not be slow to bend down its glory, majesty, grace, to earth. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-16.htm">2 Chronicles 1:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-17.htm">2 Chronicles 1:17</a> coincide with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28-29</a>, except that &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; is used for hw'q;mi, and &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488; &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is altered into &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;.
