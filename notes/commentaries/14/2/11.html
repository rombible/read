The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured to possess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. We should not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speak of God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance of his favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to be taught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willing in the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidence of the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God's love to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to be their Prince and their Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Josephus and others professed to give Greek versions of the correspondence, which (they said) had taken place between Hiram and Solomon. No value attaches to those letters, which are evidently forgeries.<p>Because the Lord hath loved his people - Compare the marginal references. The neighboring sovereigns, in their communications with the Jewish monarchs, seem to have adopted the Jewish name for the Supreme Being (Yahweh), either identifying Him (as did Hiram) with their own chief god or (sometimes) meaning merely to acknowledge Him as the special God of the Jewish nation and country. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 2:11-18.

In the parallel of Kings an identical expression is used for the communications of both: "Solomon sent to Hiram" (ver. 2), and "Hiram sent to Solomon" (ver. 8). The productions of the forms of this correspondence by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 8:2)and Eupolemus ('Ap. Praep. Evang.,' 9:33) are, of course, merely mythical. <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord hath loved his people.</span> This beautiful expression has parallels, not only in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>; but in such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-12.htm">Psalm 115:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 4</a>. These were all precursors of the fuller assertion and kinder demonstration of God's love repeated so often and in such tender connections in the Epistles of the New Testament. This verse and the following are also testimony to the indirect influences on surrounding nations of the knowledge of the one true Creator-God and Ruler-God, that was domiciled by special revelation and oracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>) with Israel. Where nations near were bitter foes, they often feared Israel's God, whereas now they were friends they could summon to their lips the highest of the outbursts of praise, not to say of adoration. The very noteworthy sympathy of Hiram with Israel may have owed something to his personal predilection for David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>). And <span class="accented">this</span> again is convincing testimony to the worth and usefulness of individual character which here influenced the destiny of two whole nations. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In order properly to worship Jahve by these sacrifices, the temple must be large, because Jahve is greater than all gods; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>.<p>No one is able (&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1495; &#1506;&#1510;&#1512; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-14.htm">1 Chronicles 29:14</a>) to build a house in which this God could dwell, for the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him.

How should I((Solomon) be able to build Him a house, scil. that He should dwell therein?

After this declaration of the purpose, there follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a> the request that he would send him for this end a skilful chief workman, and the necessary material, viz., costly woods. The chief workman was to be a man wise to work in gold, silver, etc. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm">2 Chronicles 4:11-16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a>., he prepared the brazen and metal work, and the vessels of the temple; here, on the contrary, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a> also, he is described as a man who was skilful also in purple weaving, and in stone and wood work, to denote that he was an artificer who could take charge of all the artistic work connected with the building of the temple.
