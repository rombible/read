This dying imprecation is in harmony with the spirit of the older dispensation, which exacted blood for blood. Contrast the prayer of St. Stephen, the first of Christian martyrs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-50.htm" title="Has not my hand made all these things?">Acts 7:50</a>). The prayer of Zechariah was also a prophecy destined to speedy fulfilment.

See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord look upon it and require it - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>; and contrast the words of Christ <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>, and of Stephen <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>.

So, too, the Revised Version, which also, according to its custom, removes the italic type from the two neuter pronouns "it." But probabaly a better and correcter rendering is, "The Lord will see and will require" (for it is not necessary to regard  this as a prayer of Zechariah); and thus bring it into comparison with those divinest prayers of the Saviour and of St. Stephen. The words on dying Zechariah's lips were perhaps rather the vivid reminiscence of his own well-versed knowledge of the Law, or "the Scriptures" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>). The sentence of the dying priest and prophet in one, is, by the writer of Chronicles at any rate, directed in its fall with fearful straightness to the door of <span class="cmt_word">Joash the king</span> himself. Remarkable as is the absence of the matter of this and the five preceding verses from the parallel, it will not escape notice how it is implied in vers. 17,18 there, while the <span class="accented">inclusion</span> of it here is again in patent harmony with the great object of the writer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehoiada's death: the fall of the people into idolatry: the protest of the prophet Zechariah against it, and the stoning of him. - This section is not found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12.htm">2 Kings 12</a>, but is important for the understanding of the later history of Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>.). With the death of the grey-haired high priest came a turning-point in the reign of Joash. Jehoiada had saved the life and throne of Joash, preserved to the kingdom the royal house of David, to which the promises belonged, and had put an end to the idolatry which had been transplanted into Judah by Joram's marriage into the royal house of Ahab, restoring the Jahve-worship. For this he was honoured at his death, his body being laid in the city of David among the kings: "For he had done good in Israel, and towards God and His house" (the temple). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-7.htm">2 Kings 12:7</a>, he still took an active part in the repair of the temple in the twenty-third year of Joash, and according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a> he lived for some time after the completion of that work. But after his death the people soon forgot the benefits they owed him. </body></html>
