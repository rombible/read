Literally, <span class= "ital">For with fewness of men had the host of Syria come, and Jehovah had given into their hand a host in exceeding abundance.</span> “Fewness of men” (<span class= "ital">miç’ar ‘anāshîm</span>) is a phrase not found elsewhere. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-20.htm" title="Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.">Genesis 19:20</a>.) The parallel account informs us that Hazael had intended to march against Jerusalem in person, as it would seem, after the battle in which the Syrian division had defeated the Jewish princes. Joash, however, bribed his for bearance by a present of the treasures of the Temple and palace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.">2Kings 12:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">So they executed judgment against Joash.</span>—A phrase always used of Divine requital. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm" title="For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.">Exodus 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm" title="Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the middle of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.">Ezekiel 5:10</a>.) (The construction here is unique: “they did judgments <span class= "ital">with</span> Joash,” whereas the ordinary form would be, “they did judgments <span class= "ital">in</span> Joash.” )<p>As compared with Kings, the present narrative regards the Syrian invasion from a prophetic and religious point of view, and, therefore, while it omits certain details which are there clearly specified, it is careful to mention such facts as most vividly point its moral, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the destruction of the idolatrous princes, and the rout of “a great host” by the attack of “a small company.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-24.htm" title="For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.">2 Chronicles 24:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">For, </span>or rather, <span class="ital">although, the army of the Syrians came with a small company — </span>Or was a small company of men. This more manifestly showed that the punishment proceeded from the hand of God, who took away their courage, so that, even with a great host, they could not withstand a mere handful of their enemies. This, as all the circumstances of it make manifest, was a distinct war from that mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.">2 Kings 12:17</a>; as the reader will easily see if he compare that passage with this. The case seems to have been as follows: When the Jews began to apostatize, Hazael was sent to chastise them, as is recorded <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.">2 Kings 12:17</a>; but God, in his great long-suffering, either that he might give them further space for repentance, or because he saw some partial repentance had already taken place among them, permitted Hazael to be diverted, by Joash’s presents, from his purpose of leading his army against Jerusalem. But in the end of the year, the king and people being still more sunk in idolatry, and this horrid wickedness of murdering his prophet being committed, he sent a party of these same Syrians to execute this awful judgment against Joash, who had commanded it to be committed; against the princes, who had been the instigators of it; and against the people, who had so readily obeyed such an unrighteous mandate of their apostate king and princes.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:15-27 See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly, zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They executed judgment against Joash - By defeating his army, slaying his nobles, and pressing on against Jerusalem, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 24:23-27.

Most probably, also, he promised the payment of an annual tribute, on the neglect or refusal of which the Syrians returned the following year, and with a mere handful of men inflicted a total and humiliating defeat on the collected force of the Hebrews.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,....

What they thus beseechingly requested is not stated, but may be gathered from what they did, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-18.htm">2 Chronicles 24:18</a>. They forsook Jahve the God of their fathers, etc. There came wrath upon Judah because of this their trespass. &#1511;&#1510;&#1507;, a wrathful judgment of the Lord, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-8.htm">2 Chronicles 29:8</a>, viz., the invasion of the land by Hazael, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>.

Against this defection prophets whom the Lord sent did indeed lift up their testimony, but they would not hearken to them. Of these prophets, one, Zechariah the son of the high priest Jehoiada, is mentioned by name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>., who, seized by the Spirit of the Lord, announced to the people divine punishment for their defection, and was thereupon, at the king's command, stoned in the court of the temple.

"Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, and (why) will ye not prosper?" Fidelity to the Lord is the condition of prosperity. If Israel forsake the Lord, the Lord will also forsake it; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>. </body></html>
