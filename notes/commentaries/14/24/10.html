It is easier to build temples, than to be temples to God. But the repairing of places for public worship is a good work, which all should promote. And many a good work would be done that now lies undone, if active men would put it forward.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-4.htm">2 Kings 12:4</a> that Joash had assigned to the restoration-fund two other payments also. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-14.

At the same time, the clause, occupying only one word in the original, may quite possibly purport to state summarily by anticipation that the same system was observed to the end, and the method of the chest not departed from. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As to the repair of the temple, see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5-17</a>, where both the formal divergences and the essential agreement of the two narratives are pointed out. </body></html>
