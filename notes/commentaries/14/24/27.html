See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The greatness of the burdens laid upon him - Or, "And the multitude of burdens uttered against him."

The word rendered "story" or "commentary" in our text is employed only once beside (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>). Its verbal root, however, is found about a hundred and sixty-two times, invariably in the sense of inquiring, and almost invariably rendered in the Authorized Version by the word "inquire," or "seek;" so that perhaps the word "study" or "pursuit" might, idioms being allowed for, be the nearer rendering. It is rabbinic literature mostly that has determined the preference for the word "commentary." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And they (the princes and the people) conspired against him, and stoned him, at the command of the king, in the court of the temple.

According to these passages, he was slain between the temple and the altar of burnt-offering, consequently in the most sacred part of the court of the priests. That the king, Joash, could give the command for this murder, shows how his compliance with the princes' demands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17</a>) had made him the slave of sin. Probably the idolatrous princes accused the witness for God of being a seditious person and a rebel against the majesty of the crown, and thereby extorted from the weak king the command for his death. For it is not said that Joash himself worshipped the idols; and even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">2 Chronicles 24:22</a> it is only the base ingratitude of which Joash had been guilty, in the slaughter of the son of his benefactor, which is adduced against him. But Zechariah at his death said, "May the Lord look upon it, and take vengeance" (&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to seek or require a crime, i.e., punish it). This word became a prophecy, which soon began to be fulfilled, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>. </body></html>
