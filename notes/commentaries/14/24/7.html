Besides this, at the beginning, we have a statement as to the duration and spirit of his reign; and in conclusion, the murder of Joash in consequence of a conspiracy is mentioned. Both accounts agree in all essential points, but are shown to be extracts containing the most important part of a more complete history of Joash, by the fact that, on the one hand, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12.htm">2 Kings 12</a> single circumstances are communicated in a more detailed and more exact form than that in which the Chronicle states them; while, on the other hand, the account of the Chronicle supplements the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12.htm">2 Kings 12</a> in many respects. To these latter belong the account of the marriage of Joash, and his many children, the account of the death of Jehoiada at the age of 130 years, and his honourable burial with the kings, etc.; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-15.htm">2 Chronicles 24:15</a>. </body></html>
