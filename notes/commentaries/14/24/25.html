But it is not said that Joash himself was wounded, but only that the destruction of his princes and the defeat of his army were judgments upon him. The word rendered “diseases” (<span class= "ital">mahălûyîm</span>) only occurs here; but it is obviously a near synonym of the term used of the last sickness of Jehoram (<span class= "ital">tahălû’îm,</span> 2chron xxi, 19), and the probable meaning is “pains,” or “suffering.” Calamity may have brought about the sickness of Joash, or perhaps the invasion had come upon him when already prostrate with disease, and unable to resist in person.<p><span class= "bld">His own servants conspired against him.</span>—<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm" title="And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.">2Kings 12:20</a>, “And his servants arose and made a conspiracy.” Comp. the similar circumstances in the murder of Ishbosheth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-5.htm" title="And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.">2Samuel 4:5</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest.</span>—The LXX. and Vulgate correct this, and read “son,” meaning Zechariah the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm" title="Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son.

See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They executed judgment against Joash - By defeating his army, slaying his nobles, and pressing on against Jerusalem, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. they left him in great diseases&#8212;The close of his life was embittered by a painful malady, which long confined him to bed.<p>his own servants conspired against him&#8212;These two conspirators (whose fathers were Jews, but their mothers aliens) were probably courtiers, who, having constant access to the bedchamber, could the more easily execute their design.<p>for the blood of the sons&#8212;read "the son" of Jehoiada.

These had the opportunity the rather at hand, in that he was so ill and in bed. That he died by the conspiring together of a couple of servants, whose foreign and heathen maternity is particularly recorded, was the more ignominious end for him, who had commanded Zechariah to be openly stoned - a death highly honourable in comparison. The parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>) adds that it was in "the house of Mille, which goeth down to Silla" (for the explanation of which passage, see note <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>), that the servants' conspiracy to kill Joash took effect. The sons of Jehoiada. We know of only one son, Zechariah; there may have been other sons, or other lineal relations of Jehoiada may be covered by the word "sons." We are not obliged to interpret the avenging act of the servants as one to which their own pious and patriotic zeal led them, which, considering their maternal pedigree, is perhaps something unlikely, though of course not impossible, but one to which they were incited by the retributive providence of him who held their hearts also in his hand.
