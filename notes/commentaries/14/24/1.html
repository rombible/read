It is easier to build temples, than to be temples to God. But the repairing of places for public worship is a good work, which all should promote.

Zibiah of Beersheba.</span> We do not read, in the brief account of Ahaziah, Joash's father, whom he married. Nothing is as yet known of <span class="accented">Zibiah</span>, but there must be some significance underlying the mention of her name and native place, or known place of residence. The references <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a> and Amos 8:14 may possibly contain the clue, in holding up Beersheba as the most idolatrous of idolatrous places. Beersheba offers another reference of unhappy associations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-2.htm">1 Samuel 8:2</a>). As a terminus of the land, "Dan to Beersheba" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-2.htm">2 Samuel 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a>); as a terminus of the divided Judah, "Beersheba to Mount Ephraim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4</a>), "Geba to Beersheba" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>); and as a terminus of this Judah yet reduced after the Captivity, "Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>);-its mention is notorious. The references <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a> and Genesis 26:18, 31-33 are full of interest, as bearing on the way in which the spot is first known in Bible history. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The renewal of the covenant, extirpation of Baal-worship, and the solemn entry of the king into his palace, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17-20</a>, and already commented on in that place. The remark as to the renewal of the covenant is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-16.htm">2 Chronicles 23:16</a> (Chron.) somewhat more brief than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, between himself, the same as between himself, the high priest, as representative of Jehovah. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>, the matter is more clearly expressed. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>., the statement, "the priest set overseers over the house of Jahve," is expanded by the addition of the words, "by means of the Levitic priests whom David had distributed for the house of Jahve to offer sacrifices;...and he placed doorkeepers at the doors of the house of Jahve," etc. The meaning is: Jehoiada again introduced the old arrangement of the public worship in the temple as David had settled it, it having either fallen into decay or wholly ceased under the rule of the idolatrous Athaliah. As to the remainder, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-20.htm">2 Kings 11:20</a>. </body></html>
