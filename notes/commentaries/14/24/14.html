For “vessels of ministering,” comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-12.htm" title="And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar:">Numbers 4:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Spoons.</span>—Cups or <span class= "ital">bowls</span> (<span class= "ital">kappôth,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-29.htm" title="And you shall make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover with: of pure gold shall you make them.">Exodus 25:29</a>).<p>The chronicler apparently reverses the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/12-13.htm" title="However, there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:">2Kings 12:13-14</a>, “<span class= "ital">Howbeit there were not made for the house of the Lord,</span> bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, <span class= "ital">any vessels of gold or vessels of silver</span> of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord. But they gave (<span class= "ital">used to give</span>) that to the workmen, and repaired (<span class= "ital">used to repair</span>) therewith the house of the Lord.” The solution of the difficulty may be found in the fact that the writer of Kings is relating what was done with the money so long as the repairs of the Temple were in progress, while the chronicler is accounting for the surplus after the restoration was complete. Still the appearance of contradiction is sufficiently curious, and suggests the influence of the <span class= "ital">didactic</span> aims of the later historian.<p><span class= "bld">And they offered.</span>—<span class= "ital">And they were offering, i.e.,</span> offered habitually, as a matter of regular observance (the same construction as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-12.htm" title="And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as worked iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:12</a>, “they were hiring”). The legal ritual was duly carried out in the Temple so long as the influence of Jehoiada was paramount—a remark peculiar to the chronicler. On the other hand, the present writer omits what is stated in closing the account of the Temple repairs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/12-15.htm" title="Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.">2Kings 12:15-16</a>). There we are told that no reckoning was made with the overseers of the workmen in respect of the moneys entrusted to them, “for they dealt faithfully.” It is added that the priests still received the trespass and sin money.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_chronicles/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-14.htm" title="And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer with, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.

The insertion of the italic type in the Authorized Version "withal" unnecessarily helps suggest uncertainty in this rendering, while the Revised Version gives that word in the ordinary type; margin, both Authorized Version and Revised Version, gives "pestles." The Hebrew word is (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) the hiph. turin, of the familiar verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> with article prefixed; this word, however, seems to occur only once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>), and then in the singular number. <span class="cmt_word">The rest</span> of <span class="cmt_word">the money...  made vessels for</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span>.
