The meaning is, To bring into the Temple, for the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">The collection.</span>—Tax, or <span class= "ital">impost.</span><p>This verse, and the next one also, are peculiar to the chronicle. The writer is fond of dwelling on the willingness of the people in the good old time to contribute to the cause of religion; doubtless, by way of suggestion to his own contemporaries. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-6.htm" title="Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,">1Chronicles 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-9.htm" title="Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.">1Chronicles 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-14.htm" title="But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.">1Chronicles 29:14</a>.)<p>In Kings we read: <span class= "ital">“</span>And the priests, the warders of the threshold, used to put into it all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord.”<p><span class= "bld">Until they had made an end.</span>—This is correct. The same phrase recurs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm" title="Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.">2Chronicles 31:1</a>.

Besides this, at the beginning, we have a statement as to the duration and spirit of his reign; and in conclusion, the murder of Joash in consequence of a conspiracy is mentioned. Both accounts agree in all essential points, but are shown to be extracts containing the most important part of a more complete history of Joash, by the fact that, on the one hand, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12.htm">2 Kings 12</a> single circumstances are communicated in a more detailed and more exact form than that in which the Chronicle states them; while, on the other hand, the account of the Chronicle supplements the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12.htm">2 Kings 12</a> in many respects. To these latter belong the account of the marriage of Joash, and his many children, the account of the death of Jehoiada at the age of 130 years, and his honourable burial with the kings, etc.; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-15.htm">2 Chronicles 24:15</a>. </body></html>
