See how necessary it is that we act in religion from inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or a friend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes and inferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alone will enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, and told the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, and expound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in the court of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: The Lord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginning of another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called the burdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to be upright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The nobles had taken part in the revolution which placed Joash on the throne <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-13.htm">2 Chronicles 23:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-20.htm">2 Chronicles 23:20</a>, but probably on political rather than on religious grounds. They might dislike the rule of a woman and a foreigner without participating in the zeal of Jehoiada for purity of religion. They now petitioned for a toleration of idolatry, not for a return to the condition of things which prevailed under Athaliah.

It has been suggested that what he had witnessed of the conduct of many of the priests in the careless performance of the worship, and especially their unwillingness to collect the money, as well as apply a portion of their revenues for the repairs of the temple, had alienated and disgusted him [Le Clerc].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By Hazael of Syria; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.">2 Kings 12:17</a>,18</span><a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers,....
