Perhaps Jotham was wanting towards the reformation of the land. Men may be very good, and yet not have courage and zeal to do what they might. It certainly casts blame upon the people. Jotham prospered, and became mighty. The more stedfast we are in religion, the more mighty we are, both to resist evil, and to do good. The Lord often removes wise and pious rulers, and sends others, whose follies and vices punish a people that valued not their mercies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This short chapter runs parallel with 2 Kings marginal reference), and is taken mainly from the same source or sources which it amplifies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. he did that which was right&#8212;The general rectitude of his government is described by representing it as conducted on the excellent principles which had guided the early part of his father's reign.<p>the people did yet corruptly&#8212;(See 2Ki 15:35); but the description here is more emphatic, that though Jotham did much to promote the good of his kingdom and aimed at a thorough reformation in religion, the widespread and inveterate wickedness of the people frustrated all his laudable efforts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He entered not into the temple of the Lord, </span> to wit, to offer incense.

When the priests saw the leprosy, they removed the king immediately from the holy place; and Uzziah himself also hurried to go forth, because Jahve had smitten him; for he recognised in the sudden breaking out of the leprosy a punishment from God. Azariah is called &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503;, i.e., a high priest, and is in all probability the same person as the high priest mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a> (see on the passage). &#1500;&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1488;, "It (the offering of incense) is not for thine honour before Jahve." &#1494;&#1506;&#1507;, to foam up in anger. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1494;&#1506;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;, and while he foamed against the priests, i.e., was hot against them, the leprosy had broken out. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, from by  equals  near, the altar. Thus was Uzziah visited with the same punishment, for his haughty disregard of the divinely appointed privileges of the priesthood, as was once inflicted upon Miriam for her rebellion against the prerogatives assigned to Moses by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>).</body></html>
