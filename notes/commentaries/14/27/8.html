Perhaps in one of the chronicler’s sources this notice occurred at the beginning, and in another at the end of the reign. This would account for its repetition here, after having been already stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-1.htm" title="Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

Perhaps Jotham was wanting towards the reformation of the land. Men may be very good, and yet not have courage and zeal to do what they might. It certainly casts blame upon the people. Jotham prospered, and became mighty. The more stedfast we are in religion, the more mighty we are, both to resist evil, and to do good. The Lord often removes wise and pious rulers, and sends others, whose follies and vices punish a people that valued not their mercies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Ammonites, who had submitted to Uzziah <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a>, revolted against Jotham. This revolt he firmly repressed; and, to punish it, he exacted a high rate of tribute for the three years following the termination of the war. The productiveness of the Ammonite country in grain, which is here indicated, has been remarked upon as extraordinary by modern travelers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 27:5-9.

He fought also with the king of the Ammonites&#8212;This invasion he not only repelled, but, pursuing the Ammonites into their own territory, he imposed on them a yearly tribute, which, for two years, they paid. But when Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, combined to attack the kingdom of Judah, they took the opportunity of revolting, and Jotham was too distracted by other matters to attempt the reconquest (see on [458]2Ki 15:37).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He was twenty five years old,....

This remark is not found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15.htm">2 Kings 15</a>, because there Uzziah's intrusion into the temple is also omitted. The people still did corruptly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). This refers, indeed, to the continuation of the worship in the high places, but hints also at the deep moral corruption which the prophets of that time censure (cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-5.htm">Isaiah 2:5</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>.). </body></html>
