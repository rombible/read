His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put the holy ark etc - The ark of the covenant may have been temporarily removed from the holy of holies while Josiah effected necessary repairs.<p>It shall not be a burden upon your shoulders - The removing and replacing the ark Josiah means "shall not henceforth be your duty.

Josiah Keeps a Solemn Passover.<p>1-3. Moreover Josiah kept a passover&#8212;(See on [477]2Ki 23:21). The first nine verses give an account of the preparations made for the celebration of the solemn feast [2Ch 35:1-9]. The day appointed by the law was kept on this occasion (compare 2Ch 30:2, 13). The priests were ranged in their courses and exhorted to be ready for their duties in the manner that legal purity required (compare 2Ch 29:5). The Levites, the ministers or instructors of the people in all matters pertaining to the divine worship, were commanded (2Ch 35:3) to "put the holy ark in the house which Solomon did build." Their duty was to transport the ark from place to place according to circumstances. Some think that it had been ignominiously put away from the sanctuary by order of some idolatrous king, probably Manasseh, who set a carved image in the house of God (2Ch 33:7), or Amon; while others are of opinion that it had been temporarily removed by Josiah himself into some adjoining chamber, during the repairs on the temple. In replacing it, the Levites had evidently carried it upon their shoulders, deeming that still to be the duty which the law imposed on them. But Josiah reminded them of the change of circumstances. As the service of God was now performed in a fixed and permanent temple, they were not required to be bearers of the ark any longer; and, being released from the service, they should address themselves with the greater alacrity to the discharge of other functions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which were holy</span>; or, and <span class="ital">which were holy</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the house</span>; in the temple; or in the holy of holies; whence, it may seem, it had been removed, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. By some of the wicked and idolatrous kings of Judah, possibly by Josiah’s father Amon; which peradventure may be implied by that expression, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-23.htm" title="And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.">2 Chronicles 33:23</a></span>, <span class="ital">Amon trespassed more and more</span>, i.e. more than he or his father Manasseh had done, which seems to point at some very enormous crime committed by him. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. By Josiah’s order, that the temple might be thoroughly repaired, both in the holy place, and in the most holy place, which some of the idolatrous kings of Judah, it may be, had defaced or defiled; and therefore it was to be searched in order to its reparation; and to that end it might seem fit to remove the ark: and upon this occasion Hilkiah might find the original book of the law, which was written by the hands of Moses, and by God’s command was laid beside the ark, and upon the removal of the ark was easily discovered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It shall not be a burden upon your shoulders; </span> or, that it might <span class="ital">not</span> be <span class="ital">a burden</span>, &c. So these words are to be joined with the former, as the reason why Solomon built this house, that the ark might have a constant and fixed habitation, and not need to be carried from place to place upon their shoulders, as it had been done whilst it was in the tabernacle. And withal, this is mentioned as an argument to quicken them to the more diligent service of God in their present work, because they were freed from that troublesome part of their office which lay upon their forefathers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel,.... Whose business it was to go through the several tribes, and instruct them in the knowledge of God, his word and worship, statutes and ordinances. In an ancient MS. mentioned by Junius, it is read, "who prepared for all Israel the holy things", &amp;c. <p>which were holy unto the Lord; who were consecrated to the name of the Lord, as the Targum, dedicated to his worship and service; or it may signify the holy things they taught or prepared: <p>these put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; which some think was removed from thence by Amon, and an idol put in its room, which is the greater trespass he is said to be guilty of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-23.htm">2 Chronicles 33:23</a> others, that it was privately removed by the high priest in idolatrous times, and laid up in some secret place for the preservation of it; but rather the truth is, that it had been removed by the order of Josiah, for the sake of the repairs of the most holy place; and this being done, he orders it to be replaced; and though the Levites might not go into the holy of holies, yet they could carry it to the entrance of the holy place, and the priests from thence to the door of the most holy place, where the high priest could receive it, and fix it in its proper place: <p>it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders; it was not now to be carried from place to place, having a fixed abode in the most holy place, and therefore they were at leisure to attend other service: <p>serve now the Lord your God, and his people Israel; by singing the praises of God, and slaying the passover lambs for the people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And said unto the Levites that <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; <i>it shall</i> not <i>be</i> a <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> burden upon <i>your</i> shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</span><p>(b) So that the Levites charge was not only to minister in the temple, but also to instruct the people in the word of God.<p>(c) As it was before the temple was built: therefore your office is to teach the people and to praise God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">that taught all Israel</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-7.htm" title="Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.">Nehemiah 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-9.htm" title="And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep.

We can only conjecture why the ark was not in its proper place, probably having been temporarily removed during Josiah's own restorations, or possibly having never been yet replaced from the date of some earlier removal of an iniquitous character and on the part of an iniquitous king. Secondly, as to the burden, some would explain the language as a <span class="accented">reminiscence</span> of the general and ever-applicable principle found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-26.htm">1 Chronicles 23:26</a>. This, at any rate, would seem rather more satisfactory than the suggestion conveyed by the italic type of our Authorized Version. Perhaps the explanation may rather be that the ark had latterly again and again been shifted, and Josiah wishes to protest that neither for one reason nor another shall it be again moved. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The reading of the book of the law in the temple, and the solemn renewal of the covenant, to which the king assembled the elders of Judah and Jerusalem, with all the people, after the saying of the prophetess Huldah had been reported to him, are recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-1.htm">2 Kings 23:1-3</a> as they are in the Chronicle, and have been commented upon at the former passage.

The collocation, "in Jerusalem and in Benjamin," is an abbreviation of the complete formula, "in Jerusalem and Judah and Benjamin;" then in the following clause only the inhabitants of Jerusalem are named as representatives of the inhabitants of the whole kingdom. </body></html>
