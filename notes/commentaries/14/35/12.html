His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They removed the burnt offerings - They separated from the Paschal lambs those parts which were to be burned on the altar. These parts they gave to the offerers, who took them up to the altar and handed them to the officiating priests. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. they removed the burnt offerings&#8212;Some of the small cattle being designed for burnt offerings were put apart by themselves, that they might not be intermingled with the paschal lambs, which were carefully selected according to certain rules, and intended to be sacramentally eaten; and the manner in which those burnt offerings were presented seems to have been the following: "All the subdivisions of the different fathers' houses came one after another to the altar in solemn procession to bring to the priests the portions which had been cut off, and the priests laid these pieces upon the fire of the altar of burnt offering."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They removed the burnt-offerings, </span> i.e. those cattle which were to be offered for burnt-offerings, to wit, some of the lesser cattle; for these also might be offered as burnt-offerings, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10</a></span>. And hence it may seem that all these small cattle were not given to the people to be eaten by them for their paschal lambs, but that some of them were to be offered as burnt-offerings for the people. And these they put apart by themselves, partly lest they should be confounded with them which were for another use; and partly that they might not be hindered from that which was their present and more immediate work, as it follows, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that they might give, </span> to wit, the paschal lambs or kids. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To offer unto the Lord:</span> these words may belong either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
