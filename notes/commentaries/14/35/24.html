The learned Dr. Prideaux endeavours to justify his conduct in opposing the passage of the king of Egypt, because it was a service due to the king of Assyria, to whom Josiah was a vassal. “Be it so,” says Dr. Dodd, “yet his duty to the king of Assyria could not dissolve his dependance on a higher Master. He went to war as vassal of the king of Assyria, but did he ask counsel of God as king of Judah? Or was he attended to the war with such forces only as the kings of Judah might lawfully use? That he had chariots and horsemen, appears plainly from this account of his death. That this was the true or only cause of his misfortune, I dare not affirm; for I have no express authority to support me in affirming it: but this I see, that he was found in the day of battle, not with the equipage of a king of Judah, but surrounded with forces which the law of his God had forbidden him to trust to, and which had often proved a strength fatal to his ancestors.” See Bishop Sherlock’s <span class="ital">Dissertation on the Use and Intent of Prophecy, </span>at the end.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:20-27 The Scripture does not condemn Josiah's conduct in opposing Pharaoh. Yet Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord after he was warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it was a judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life of repentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the sudden manner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn over sufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them. Yet this alone can turn away judgments. If we blame Josiah's conduct, we should be watchful, lest we be cut down in a way dishonourable to our profession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fate of Josiah was unprecedented.

We still find no note whatever of blame attributed to Josiah, and the general mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>) appears to have been most genuine. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a> contains the remark that the Israelites had not held such a passover since the days of the prophet Samuel and all the kings; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a>, where, instead of the days of Samuel, the days of the judges are mentioned. On the points which distinguished this passover above others, see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a>. In the concluding clause we have a rhetorical enumeration of those who participated in the festival, beginning with the king and ending with the inhabitants of Jerusalem. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; are the remnant of the kingdom of the ten tribes who had come to the festival; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-19.htm">2 Chronicles 35:19</a> the year of this passover is mentioned in conclusion. The statement, "in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah," refers back to the same date at the beginning of the account of the cultus reform (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>), and indicates that Josiah's cultus reform culminated in this passover. Now since the passover fell in the middle of the first month of the year, and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>, the book of the law was also found in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, many commentators have imagined that the eighteenth year of the king is dated from the autumn; so that all that is narrated in 2 Chronicles, from 34:8-35:19, happened within a period of six months and a half. This might possibly be the case; since the purification and repair of the temple may have been near their completion when the book of the law was found, so that they might hold the passover six months afterwards. But our passage does not require that the years of the king's reign should be dated from the autumn, and there are not sufficient grounds for believing that such was the case. Neither in our narrative, nor in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a> and 23, is it said that the passover was resolved upon or arrange din consequence of the finding of the book of the law. Josiah may therefore have thought of closing and ratifying the restoration of the Jahve-worship by a solemn passover festival, even before the finding of the book; and the two events need not be widely separated from each other. But from the way in which the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a> and 23 is arranged, it is not improbable that the finding of the book of the law may have occurred before the beginning of the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, and that date may have been placed at the beginning and end of the narrative, because the cultus reform was completed with the celebration of the passover in his eighteenth year.<p>(Note: The addition of the lxx to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>, "in the eighth month," to which Thenius and Berth. attach some weight, as a proof that the years of Josiah's reign are dated from autumn, is utterly useless for that purpose. For even were that addition more than a worthless gloss, it would only prove the contrary, since the eighth month of the civil year, which is reckoned from autumn, corresponds to the second month of the ecclesiastical year, and would consequently carry us beyond the time of the passover.) </body></html>
