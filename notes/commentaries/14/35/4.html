His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put the holy ark etc - The ark of the covenant may have been temporarily removed from the holy of holies while Josiah effected necessary repairs.<p>It shall not be a burden upon your shoulders - The removing and replacing the ark Josiah means "shall not henceforth be your duty.

Only <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-32.htm">2 Chronicles 34:32</a>, the contents of which correspond to the words, "And the whole people entered into the covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>), will need explanation. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is usually translated, "he caused the people to enter into the covenant" (after 2 Kings). This is in substance correct, but exegetically cannot be defended, since &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; does not precede, so as to allow of its here being supplied from the context. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; only signifies, he caused all who were in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand, and they did according to the covenant of God; whence we can easily supply in the first clause, "and to do according to the covenant." The collocation, "in Jerusalem and in Benjamin," is an abbreviation of the complete formula, "in Jerusalem and Judah and Benjamin;" then in the following clause only the inhabitants of Jerusalem are named as representatives of the inhabitants of the whole kingdom. </body></html>
