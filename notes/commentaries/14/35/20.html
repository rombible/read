His Death.<p>20. After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple&#8212;He most probably calculated that the restoration of the divine worship, with the revival of vital religion in the land, would lead, according to God's promise and the uniform experience of the Hebrew people, to a period of settled peace and increased prosperity. His hopes were disappointed. The bright interval of tranquillity that followed his re-establishment of the true religion was brief. But it must be observed that this interruption did not proceed from any unfaithfulness in the divine promise, but from the state into which the kingdom of Judah had brought itself by the national apostasy, which was drawing down upon it the long threatened but long deferred judgments of God.<p>Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates&#8212;Necho, son of Psammetichus, succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the twentieth year of Josiah. He was a bold and enterprising king, who entered with all his heart into the struggle which the two great powers of Egypt and Assyria had long carried on for the political ascendency. Each, jealous of the aggressive movements of its rival, was desirous to maintain Palestine as a frontier barrier. After the overthrow of Israel, the kingdom of Judah became in that respect doubly important. Although the king and people had a strong bias for alliance with Egypt, yet from the time of Manasseh it had become a vassal of Assyria. Josiah, true to his political no less than his religious engagements, thought himself bound to support the interests of his Assyrian liege lord. Hence, when "Necho king of Egypt came up to fight Carchemish, Josiah went out against him." Carchemish, on the eastern side of the Euphrates, was the key of Assyria on the west, and in going thither the king of Egypt would transport his troops by sea along the coast of Palestine, northwards. Josiah, as a faithful vassal, resolved to oppose Necho's march across the northern parts of that country. They met in the "valley of Megiddo," that is, the valley or plain of Esdraelon. The Egyptian king had come either by water or through the plains of Philistia, keeping constantly along the coast, round the northwest corner of Carmel, and so to the great plain of Megiddo. This was not only his direct way to the Euphrates, but the only route fit for his chariots, while thereby also he left Judah and Jerusalem quite to his right. In this valley, however, the Egyptian army had necessarily to strike across the country, and it was on that occasion that Josiah could most conveniently intercept his passage. To avoid the difficulty of passing the river Kishon, Necho kept to the south of it, and must, therefore, have come past Megiddo. Josiah, in following with his chariots and horsemen from Jerusalem, had to march northwards along the highway through Samaria by Kefr-Kud (the ancient Caper-Cotia) to Megiddo [Van De Velde].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When Josiah had prepared the temple; </span> when he and his people hoped that God was reconciled, and the foundation of a solid and lasting happiness was laid, their hopes were quickly blasted.

This was Neco II. (reigned 611–595 b.c., Maspero, <span class="ital">Histoire Ancienne</span>, p. 545, note), who according to Herodotus (II. 159) conquered the “Syrians” (Jews <span class="ital">or</span> Assyrians?) at “Magdol” (Megiddo <span class="ital">or</span> Magdol near the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile?) and then captured Cadytis (Kadesh on the Orontes <span class="ital">or</span> Gaza?), an important city of Syria. The account of Herodotus is obscure, ambiguous and defective, but a comparison of 2 Kings with an inscription of Nabu-na’id king of Babylon (555–538 b.c.) sets Neco’s action in a clearer light. The campaign (which took place about 608 b.c.) was directed “against the king of Assyria” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2 Kings 23:29</a>), i.e. against the last king Sin-šar-iškun (Saracos) who was at war with Nabopolassar (father of Nebuchadnezzar), king of Babylon. Nabopolassar, hard pressed, called in to his help the Umman-manda (Scythians), who destroyed Nineveh circ. 608 b.c.; cp. Messerschmidt, <span class="ital">die Inschrift der Stele Nabu-na’id’s</span> (pp. 5–13). Neco advanced to the Euphrates to secure some of the spoils of the Assyrian overthrow, but the victory of Nebuchadnezzar over Neco at Carchemish (circ. 605 b.c.) finally excluded Egypt from any share.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">against Carchemish</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm" title="Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.">Jeremiah 46:2</a>. It was a city situated near the junction of the Habor and Euphrates. In 2 Kin., “against the king of Assyria.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>20–24 (= <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/1-25.htm" title="Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass, that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchamis upon Euphrates: and Josias went out against him....">1Es 1:25-31</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him....">2 Kings 23:29-30</a>). The Death of Josiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The account of Josiah’s death is very much fuller in Chron. than in Kings. The features which are peculiar to the Chronicler are, (1) Neco’s message to dissuade Josiah from war, (2) Josiah’s disguising himself and coming to fight <span class="ital">in the valley of Megiddo</span>, (3) the wounding of Josiah by archers, (4) the transfer of the wounded king from a war chariot to another chariot. In other words all the details which represent the meeting at Megiddo as a battle are peculiar to Chron.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The account given in Kings is simply:—“King Josiah <span class="ital">went to meet</span> him (Necho), and he put him to death <span class="ital">at Megiddo</span> when he saw him. And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem.” The Hebrew expression for “went to meet” in this passage is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-16.htm" title="So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.">1 Kings 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2 Kings 16:10</a>; it does not suggest a <span class="ital">hostile</span> meeting, though it can be used in a suitable context to describe one. The phrase “when he saw him” suggests an interview rather than a battle. Thus we have two traditions of Josiah’s death: according to Chron. he was mortally wounded in battle, according to Kings he sought an interview with Neco and was assassinated by him at the town of Megiddo.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After all this</span>. A period of about thirteen years of happy retrospect is now the portion of the good king. This period brings itself to an unhappy and even fatal termination in the year  <span class="date">B.C. 608</span>; when, as it would appear by the result, King Josiah did wrong, and went out of his way, in opposing the march of Pharaoh-Necho (who reigned  <span class="date">B.C. 611-595</span>), successor of Psammetichus King of Egypt, against Cyaxares (the monarch who, with Nabo-polassar, had taken Nineveh,  <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>) King of <span class="accented">Assyria</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>), or King of Babylon at <span class="accented">Circesium on the River Phrat</span>, the head-quarters now of the united Assyrian and Babylonian power. Where the fault or sin of Josiah lay - whether he ran before he was sent, or whether, according to our following two verses, he set out <span class="accented">against</span> the Divine word by Necho - is certainly a question left in obscurity. Nothing is said in our history or its parallel to accredit the tale of Necho, or to discredit the heart and motive of Josiah - nothing <span class="accented">except</span> what silence and the result <span class="accented">seem</span> to say. One other clement of interest and of difficulty may be added to the question; for of the thirteen years' interval, which we have described above as one presumably of happy retrospect in certain aspects for Josiah, we know nothing from Scripture, but have <span class="accented">every</span> reason to suppose that during it Josiah and his kingdom had become subject, if only nominally, to Nabopolassar; so that, in offering to resist Necho of Egypt, he was offering to strengthen so far forth the royal line which did dishonour to his own country and his country's God. Upon this supposition, however, we can lay no stress. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And afterwards (&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, postea, after the passover had been prepared for the laymen in the way described) the Levites prepared it for themselves and for the priests; for the latter, however, only because they were busied with the offering of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and the &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; till night. Most expositors understand by &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; the fat of the paschal lambs, which was burnt upon the altar, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-12.htm">2 Chronicles 35:12</a>; and &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, the fat of oxen, which was likewise burnt upon the altar, "but was not, as it seems, designated by the expression &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;" (Berth.). This interpretation certainly at first sight seems likely; only one cannot see why only the fat of the oxen, and not that of the paschal lambs also, should be called &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, since in the law the parts of all thank-offerings (oxen, sheep, and goats) which were burnt upon the altar are called &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;. We will therefore be more correct if we take &#1493;&#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; to be a more exact definition of &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;: the burnt-offering, viz., the fat which was offered as a burnt-offering; or we may take &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; here to denote the evening burnt-offering, and &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; the fat of the paschal lambs. But even if the first-mentioned interpretation were the only correct one, yet it could not thence be concluded that on the passover evening (the 14th Nisan) the fat not only of the 37,600 lambs and goats, but also of the 3800 oxen, were offered upon the altar; the words, that the priests were busied until night with the offering of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and the &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, are rather used of the sacrificing generally during the whole of the seven days' festival. For the compressed character of the description appears in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>, where it is remarked that neither the singers nor the porters needed to leave their posts, because their brethren the Levites prepared (the meal) for them.
