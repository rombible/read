On the Passover evening only the paschal lambs and kids would be eaten; the oxen were slain as peace offerings during the subsequent festivities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/16-1.htm" title="Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover to the LORD your God: for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night.">Deuteronomy 16:1-8</a>), and furnished forth the sacrificial meals.<p><span class= "bld">And divided them speedily . . . the people.</span>—<span class= "ital">And brought them quickly to all the sons of the people,</span> so that the meat did not get cold.

This little touch of realism calls up a picture.

His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They removed the burnt offerings - They separated from the Paschal lambs those parts which were to be burned on the altar.
