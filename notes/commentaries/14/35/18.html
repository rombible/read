His solemnizing the passover is related here. The Lord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewish festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof of growing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy, and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belonging to us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They might not depart - The singers and porters remained at their posts, while other Levites sacrificed for them and brought them their share of the lambs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel&#8212;One feature by which this passover was distinguished was the liberality of Josiah. But what distinguished it above all preceding solemnities was, not the imposing grandeur of the ceremonies, nor the immensity of the assembled concourse of worshippers; for these, with the exception of a few from the kingdom of Israel, were confined to two tribes; but it was the ardent devotion of the king and people, the disregard of purely traditional customs, and the unusually strict adherence, even in the smallest minuti&aelig;, to the forms of observance prescribed in the book of the law, the discovery of an original copy of which had produced so great a sensation. Instead of "from the days of Samuel," the author of the Book of Kings says, "from the days of the judges who judged Israel" [2Ki 23:22]. The meaning is the same in both passages, for Samuel concluded the era of the judges.<p>all Judah and Israel that were present&#8212;The great majority of the people of the northern kingdom were in exile, but some of the remaining inhabitants performed the journey to Jerusalem on this occasion. 37,600 paschal lambs and kids were used, which [2Ch 35:7], at ten to a company, would make 376,000 persons attending the feast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel,....

For it was kept on the proper day in the first month, and was not a mere supplementary Passover; it was observed with due regularity, and not by worshippers some of whom were unclean; and if we allow thirteen persons for each lamb or kid, there were upwards of half a million communicants; while, so far as we know, there were only seventeen thousand sheep presented by Hezekiah and his princes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-24.htm">2 Chronicles 30:24</a>), which would not supply more than half the number of partakers. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And they took away the burnt-offerings, to give them to the divisions of the fathers'-houses of the sons of the people, to offer unto the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses; and so also in regard to the oxen." &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512; signifies the taking off or separating of the pieces intended to be burnt upon the altar from the beasts slain for sacrifice, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-9.htm">Leviticus 3:9</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-31.htm">Leviticus 4:31</a>. &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, in this connection, can only signify the parts of the paschal lamb which were to be burnt upon the altar, viz., the same parts which were separated from sheep and goats when they were brought as thank-offerings and burnt upon the altar (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-6.htm">Leviticus 3:6-16</a>). These pieces are here called &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, because they not only were wholly burnt like the burnt-offering, but also were burnt upon the flesh of the evening burnt-offering to God, for a savour of good pleasure; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-13.htm">Leviticus 1:13</a>. They cannot have been special burnt-offerings, which were burnt along with or at the same time with the fat of the paschal lambs; for there were no special festal burnt-offerings, besides the daily evening sacrifice, prescribed for the passover on the evening of the 14th Nisan; and the oxen given by the king and the princes for the passover are specially mentioned in the concluding clause of the verse, &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1493;&#1499;&#1503;, so that they cannot have been included in &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;. The suffix in &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; might be referred to &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1495;: to give the paschal lambs, after the &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; had been separated from them, to the divisions of the people. But the following &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; does not harmonize with that interpretation; and the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>, that the Levites gave the roasted and boiled flesh to the sons of the people, is still more inconsistent with it. We must consequently refer &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; to the immediately preceding noun, &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;: to give the parts separated from the paschal lambs to be burnt upon the altar to the divisions of the people, that they might offer them to the Lord. This can only mean that each division of the fathers'-houses of the people approached the altar in turn to give the portions set apart from the &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; to the priests, who then offered them on the fire of the altar to the Lord. On &#1489;&#1505; &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; Gusset. has already rightly remarked: Lex Mosis hic allegatur non quasi omnia illa quae praecedunt, exprimerentur in ipsa, sed respective seu respectu eorum quae mandata erant; quibus salvis adjungi potuerunt quidam modi agendi innocui et commodi ad legis jussa exsequenda. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1493;&#1499;&#1503;, and so was it done also with the oxen, which consequently were not offered as burnt-offerings, but as thank-offerings, only the fat being burnt upon the altar, and the flesh being used for sacrificial meals.</body></html>
