This is in substance correct, but exegetically cannot be defended, since &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; does not precede, so as to allow of its here being supplied from the context. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; only signifies, he caused all who were in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand, and they did according to the covenant of God; whence we can easily supply in the first clause, "and to do according to the covenant." The collocation, "in Jerusalem and in Benjamin," is an abbreviation of the complete formula, "in Jerusalem and Judah and Benjamin;" then in the following clause only the inhabitants of Jerusalem are named as representatives of the inhabitants of the whole kingdom. </body></html>
