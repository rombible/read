As they could not leave their posts, for the singing was resumed as every fresh company entered, the Levites prepared for them also; for the various bands relieved each other in turn, and while the general choir was doing duty, a portion of the tuneful brethren, relieved for a time, partook of the viands that were brought them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/35.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time,....
