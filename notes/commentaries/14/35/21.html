So did the Assyrians, as abundantly appears from their inscriptions. So, too, we read on the Moabite stone, “Chemosh said unto me, Go; take Nebo . . . Go up against Horonaim, and take it.” These facts sufficiently explain the text, without assuming that Necho had received an oracle <span class= "ital">from Jehovah,</span> or was referring to the God of Israel.

Some think he only pretended this, because he knew Josiah had a great reverence for God, and in obedience to him might desist from his purpose. And the Targum, with some of the Jews, thinks he called his own idol by the name of God; though Kimchi thinks, and the event makes it most probable, that he spoke of the true God, who perhaps admonished him in a dream, as he did Abimelech, or sent him a message to go against the Assyrians by the Prophet Jeremiah, many of whose prophecies are directed to foreign nations. <span class="ital">Forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, </span>&c. — It is at thy peril if thou engage against one who has both a better army, and a better cause, and God on his side.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>35:20-27 The Scripture does not condemn Josiah's conduct in opposing Pharaoh. Yet Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord after he was warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it was a judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life of repentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the sudden manner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn over sufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them. Yet this alone can turn away judgments. If we blame Josiah's conduct, we should be watchful, lest we be cut down in a way dishonourable to our profession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house wherewith I have war - Necho viewed Babylon as the successor and representative of Assyria - the hereditary enemy of Egypt - and he means that he is merely continuing an old hostility with which Josiah has nothing to do. No doubt the Assyrian and Egyptian armies had often passed up and down Syria by the coast route, without approaching Jerusalem, or even touching the soil of Judaea.<p>God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God - These are remarkable words in the mouth of a pagan; but ancient inscriptions show that the Egyptian kings, in a certain sense, acknowledged a single supreme god, and considered their actions to be inspired by him. (e. g. The god Tum (compare) the name of his city, Pithom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a> note) was worshipped as ankh, "the living One" (compare "Yahweh")). Hence, Necho merely expressed himself as Egyptian kings were in the habit of doing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21, 22. But he sent ambassadors &#8230; What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah?&#8212;Not wishing to spend time, or strength in vain, Necho informed the king of Judah that he had no intention of molesting the Jews; that his expedition was directed solely against his old Assyrian enemy; and that he had undertaken it by an express commission from God. Commentators are not agreed whether it was really a divine commission given him through Jeremiah, or whether he merely used the name of God as an authority that Josiah would not refuse to obey. As he could not know the truth of Necho's declaration, Josiah did not sin in opposing him; or, if he sinned at all, it was a sin of ignorance. The engagement took place. Josiah was mortally wounded [2Ch 35:23].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/35.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Against the house wherewith I have war, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">against the house or family of my war</span>, i.e. against the house of the king of Assyria, between whom and me there is war. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">God commanded me; </span> either his false god by their lying priests; or the true God, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Most expositors understand by &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; the fat of the paschal lambs, which was burnt upon the altar, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-12.htm">2 Chronicles 35:12</a>; and &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, the fat of oxen, which was likewise burnt upon the altar, "but was not, as it seems, designated by the expression &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;" (Berth.). This interpretation certainly at first sight seems likely; only one cannot see why only the fat of the oxen, and not that of the paschal lambs also, should be called &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, since in the law the parts of all thank-offerings (oxen, sheep, and goats) which were burnt upon the altar are called &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;. We will therefore be more correct if we take &#1493;&#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; to be a more exact definition of &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;: the burnt-offering, viz., the fat which was offered as a burnt-offering; or we may take &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; here to denote the evening burnt-offering, and &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; the fat of the paschal lambs. But even if the first-mentioned interpretation were the only correct one, yet it could not thence be concluded that on the passover evening (the 14th Nisan) the fat not only of the 37,600 lambs and goats, but also of the 3800 oxen, were offered upon the altar; the words, that the priests were busied until night with the offering of the &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; and the &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, are rather used of the sacrificing generally during the whole of the seven days' festival. For the compressed character of the description appears in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>, where it is remarked that neither the singers nor the porters needed to leave their posts, because their brethren the Levites prepared (the meal) for them.
