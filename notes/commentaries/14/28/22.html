He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tilgath-pilneser - This form of the name is doubly corrupt.

At this time, when the kings Rezin and Pekah had so smitten Ahaz, the latter sent to the king of Assyria praying him for help. The time when Ahaz sought the help of the king of Assyria is neither exactly stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-9</a>, nor can we conclude, as Bertheau thinks we can, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>. that it happened soon after the invasion of Judah by the allied kings. The plural &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497; is rhetorical, like the plur. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>. For, that Ahaz applied only to one king, in the opinion of the chronicler also, we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-21.htm">2 Chronicles 28:21</a>. By the plural the thought is expressed that Ahaz, instead of seeking the help of Jahve his God, which the prophet had promised him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>.), turned to the kings of the world-power, so hostile to the kingdom of God, from whom he naturally could obtain no real help. Even here the thought which is expressed only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-21.htm">2 Chronicles 28:21</a>, is present to the mind of the author of the Chronicle. For before he narrates the issue of the help thus sought from the Assyrian world-power in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17-19</a>, he ranges all the other afflictions which Judah suffered by its enemies, viz., the devastating inroads of the Edomites and Philistines, in a series of circumstantial clauses, as they preceded in time the oppression of Tiglath-pileser.</body></html>
