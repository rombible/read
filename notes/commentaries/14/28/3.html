He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 28<p>2Ch 28:1-21.

It is probable however that the original significance of the custom is preserved in the phrase used by the Chronicler, and that children offered to Molech were really burnt. Of course such a sacrifice would be resorted to only in extremities; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall.

The position of this note, which is altogether omitted in the Chronicle, at the end of the account of Jotham in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>, appears to hint that this war broke out only towards the end of Jotham's reign, so that he could not undertake anything important against this foe.</body></html>
