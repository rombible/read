God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet in his disease he sought not ... - Rather, "and also in his disease he sought not." Not only in his war with Baasha, but also when attacked by illness, Asa placed undue reliance upon the aid of man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Asa &#8230; was diseased in his feet&#8212;probably the gout.<p>yet his disease was exceeding great&#8212;better, "moved upwards" in his body, which proves the violent and dangerous type of the malady.<p>yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians&#8212;most probably Egyptian physicians, who were anciently in high repute at foreign courts, and who pretended to expel diseases by charms, incantations, and mystic arts. Asa's fault consisted in his trusting to such physicians, while he neglected to supplicate the aid and blessing of God. The best and holiest men have been betrayed for a time into sins, but through repentance have risen again; and as Asa is pronounced a good man (2Ch 15:17), it may be presumed that he also was restored to a better state of mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forty first year of his reign.

The parallel, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>), makes this date one and the same thing with his "old age<span class="accented"></span>," while no manipulation of dates can make him (the grandson of Rehoboam and son of Abijah) more than about fifty. And it is somewhat remarkable that, when introduced to us as succeeding to the throne, nothing is said of his tender youth (as, for instance, is said in the case of Josiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-3</a>). Nevertheless, the apparent prominence of Maachah awhile would tally with the circumstance of Asa's youth at his accession. Another correspondence in Josiah's career is noticeable; for it is distinctly said that when he was only twelve years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>) "he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places," etc. At a similarly youthful age Asa, therefore, may be credited with doing the like, while later on he took more stringent measures, as for instance with Maachah, the queen-mother. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The rebuke of the prophet Hanani, and Asa's crime. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7</a>. The prophet Hanani is met with only here. Jehu, the son of Hanani, who announced to Baasha the ruin of his house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1</a>), and who reappears under Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>), was without doubt his son. Hanani said to King Asa, "Because thou hast relied on the king of Aram, and not upon Jahve thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Aram escaped out of thy hand." Berth. has correctly given the meaning thus: "that Asa, if he had relied upon God, would have conquered not only the host of Baasha, but also the host of the king of Damascus, if he had, as was to be feared, in accordance with his league with Baasha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-3.htm">2 Chronicles 16:3</a>), in common with Israel, made an attack upon the kingdom of Judah." To confirm this statement, the prophet points to the victory over the great army of the Cushites, which Asa had won by his trust in God the Lord. With the Cushites Hanani names also &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, Libyans (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>), and besides &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;, the war-chariots, also &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; osla ,sto, horsemen, in order to portray the enemy rhetorically, while in the historical narrative only the immense number of warriors and the multitude of the chariots is spoken of. </body></html>
