God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The explanation of the plural - "sepulchres" - will be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-30.htm">1 Kings 13:30</a> note.<p>The burning of spices in honor of a king at his funeral was customary (compare the marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. they buried him in his own sepulchres&#8212;The tombs in the neighborhood of Jerusalem were excavated in the side of a rock.

The use or associations of this word (found about fifty times) are almost entirely, if not entirely, those of the bed of nightly rest, even when not at the time speaking of nightly rest; and this is the first and only occasion that it is employed to link the grave in kindly analogy with the couch of bodily repose during lifetime.

The prophet Hanani is met with only here. Jehu, the son of Hanani, who announced to Baasha the ruin of his house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1</a>), and who reappears under Jehoshaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>), was without doubt his son. Hanani said to King Asa, "Because thou hast relied on the king of Aram, and not upon Jahve thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Aram escaped out of thy hand." Berth. has correctly given the meaning thus: "that Asa, if he had relied upon God, would have conquered not only the host of Baasha, but also the host of the king of Damascus, if he had, as was to be feared, in accordance with his league with Baasha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-3.htm">2 Chronicles 16:3</a>), in common with Israel, made an attack upon the kingdom of Judah." To confirm this statement, the prophet points to the victory over the great army of the Cushites, which Asa had won by his trust in God the Lord. With the Cushites Hanani names also &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, Libyans (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>), and besides &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;, the war-chariots, also &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; osla ,sto, horsemen, in order to portray the enemy rhetorically, while in the historical narrative only the immense number of warriors and the multitude of the chariots is spoken of. </body></html>
