These statements are obviously irreconcilable with that of our verse. We must suppose either that the chronicler has accepted a different calculation from that of the Kings—a calculation which he may have found in one of his documents; or that the text here is unsound, and thirty-six has been substituted by an error of transcription for sixteen, or twenty-six; and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm" title="And there was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:19</a> by a similar mistake thirty-five has taken the place of fifteen or twenty-five. Upon the whole, the latter alternative appears preferable; and if we assume twenty-five and twenty-six to be the correct numerals, we get the following chronology for the reign :—First, ten years of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.">2Chronicles 14:1</a>), during which Asa strengthened his defences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/14-6.htm" title="And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.">2Chronicles 14:6-8</a>); then the invasion of Zerah, at what precise date is not clear, but at some time between the eleventh and the fifteenth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2Chronicles 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-10.htm" title="So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:10</a>); then the reformation of religion and renewal of the covenant in Asa’s fifteenth year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-10.htm" title="So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:10</a>); and lastly, another ten years of peace, until the outbreak of the war with Baasha, in the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year.<p>The idea of the ancient commentators, that the phrase “five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa” might mean “five and thirtieth year of the kingdom of Judah,” is absurd. The phrase “<span class= "ital">bishnath</span> . . . <span class= "ital">lemalkûth”</span> always denotes the year of a king’s reign, not of the duration of his kingdom. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-12.htm" title="And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.">2Chronicles 16:12</a> <span class= "ital">infra.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">And built Ramah.</span>—<span class= "ital">Er-Râm,</span> about five miles north of Jerusalem. Baasha had probably retaken the cities annexed by Abijah. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-8.htm" title="And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.">2Chronicles 15:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Built =</span> fortified it.

Baasha began his reign in the third year of Asa, and reigned no more than twenty-four years.

The late defection of so many of his subjects to the house of David was the occasion of his fortifying this place, designing hereby both to prevent others of them from revolting, and to hinder Asa’s subjects from coming into his dominions to seduce his people from their obedience to him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death. - A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This passage runs parallel with Kings (see the marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>2Ch 16:1-14. Asa, by a League with the Syrians, Diverts Baasha from Building Ramah.<p>1-6. In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha &#8230; came up against Judah&#8212;Baasha had died several years before this date (1Ki 15:33), and the best biblical critics are agreed in considering this date to be calculated from the separation of the kingdoms, and coincident with the sixteenth year of Asa's reign. This mode of reckoning was, in all likelihood, generally followed in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel, the public annals of the time (2Ch 16:11), the source from which the inspired historian drew his account.<p>Baasha &#8230; built Ramah&#8212;that is, fortified it. The blessing of God which manifestly rested at this time on the kingdom of Judah, the signal victory of Asa, the freedom and purity of religious worship, and the fame of the late national covenant, were regarded with great interest throughout Israel, and attracted a constantly increasing number of emigrants to Judah. Baasha, alarmed at this movement, determined to stem the tide; and as the high road to and from Jerusalem passed by Ramah, he made that frontier town, about six miles north of Asa's capital, a military station, where the vigilance of his sentinels would effectually prevent all passage across the boundary of the kingdom (see on [439]1Ki 15:16-22; also Jer 41:9).Asa maketh a league with the Syrians against the king of Israel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah....">2 Chronicles 16:1-6</a></span>; for which the prophet reproving him, he putteth him into prison, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/16-7.htm" title="And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand....">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a></span>.

If it be objected, <span class="ital">That the reign or kingdom of Asa</span> is otherwise understood of the time of Asa’s personal reign, (as I may call it,)<span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-10.htm" title="So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.">2 Chronicles 15:10</a></span>; the answer is obvious, That there are many instances in Scripture (some of which have been formerly given, and others will be given in their proper places) where the same word or phrase is taken differently, and that in the very same chapter and history. And particularly this variety is elsewhere used, both by sacred and profane writers, in the computation of the years of princes, which are sometimes reckoned from the beginning of their reign, and sometimes from other remarkable times and occurrences. Titus Nebuchadnezzar’s years are sometimes computed from the beginning of his reign, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm" title="And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:">2 Kings 25:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm" title="Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,">Jeremiah 52:12</a>,29,30</span>, and sometimes from his complete conquest of Syria and Egypt, &c., as that passage, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm" title="And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.">Daniel 2:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar</span>, is by the general stream of interpreters understood. Thus Ahaziah’s years, which doubtless were usually computed from the time of his birth, are computed from another head, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm" title="Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.">2 Chronicles 22:2</a></span>, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm" title="Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>"</span>. And the like differences are observed in computing the years of some of the Syrian monarchs and Roman emperors; and particularly of Augustus, the years of whose reign are variously accounted by the Roman historians; sometimes from his first consulship, sometimes from the time of the triumvirate, and sometimes from that famous victory at Actium, where he utterly overthrew his competitor, and made himself sole and unquestionable emperor. And therefore it is not strange if it be so here. And that it must necessarily be thus understood, appears from hence, that it cannot be the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa in his own person, because Baasha began to reign in Asa’s third year, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-28.htm" title="Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.">1 Kings 15:28</a></span>, and reigned only twenty-four years, and consequently died in Asa’s twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh year, as it is said he did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-8.htm" title="And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.">1 Kings 15:8</a></span>. <span class="bld">That he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah; </span> that he might keep his subjects from revolting to Asa, as he perceived they began to do, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2 Chronicles 15:9</a></span>, and keep Asa’s subjects from coming into his dominions to seduce his people from their obedience to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In the thirty and sixth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah,....

The word signifies "lofty," and the present history speaks the importance of its position, and would infer also that Israel had regained Bethel, which, with other adjacent places, Abijah had wrested from Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>). The reference of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28, 29</a>, 82 is exceedingly interesting, and bespeaks the fact that Ramah commanded another intersecting route from Ephraim.
