God is displeased when he is distrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his power and goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have the Rock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophet shows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see how deceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things to stay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa's displeasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him to himself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, was left to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Two years before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In all conflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts, that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abel-maim - or, "Abel-beth-maachah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>.

The parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>)is so much the more graphic that it contains the two additions that Asa "made a proclamation throughout all Judah," and one that "exempted none" from joining in the duty of moving all the stones and all the timber from Ramah, and diverting' them to the use of building Geba and Mizpah. This greatly contributed to command the road from the north to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Geba</span>. This was Geba of Benjamin, as clearly stated in the parallel. It was a position north of Ramah, whether opposite Michmash and the modern Jeba is not certain, as some think this answers to Gibeah of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mizpah</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2, 3, 9, 10</a>). This Mizpah is not that of the Shefelah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>), but was situate about two hours, or a short six miles, north-west of Jerusalem, on the Samaria route, and is probably the modern <span class="accented">Neby Samwil</span> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5-41:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm">2 Chronicles 15:19</a> is different from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-16.htm">1 Kings 15:16</a>. In the latter passage it is said: war was between Asa and Baasha the king of Israel &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, i.e., so long as both reigned contemporaneously; while in the Chronicle it is said: war was not until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign. This discrepancy is partly got rid of by taking &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; in the book of Kings to denote the latent hostility or inimical attitude of the two kingdoms towards each other, and in the Chronicle to denote a war openly declared. The date, until the thirty-fifth year, causes a greater difficulty; but this has been explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> by the supposition that in the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign war broke out between Asa and Baasha, when the meaning of our 16th verse would be: It did not come to war with Baasha until the thirty-sixth year of Asa's rule.
