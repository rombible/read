It may be, after all, that these were stones with veins of different colors for decorating the walls. This was an ancient and thoroughly Oriental kind of embellishment. There was an under pavement of marble, which was covered with planks of fir. The whole interior was lined with boards, richly decorated with carved work, clusters of foliage and flowers, among which the pomegranate and lotus (or water-lily) were conspicuous; and overlaid, excepting the floor, with gold, either by gilding or in plates (1Ki 6:1-38).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm" title="And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.">1 Kings 9:26</a>"</span>, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold <i>was</i> gold of <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> Parvaim.</span><p>(e) Some think it is Peru.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">precious stones</span>] Not mentioned in the parallel account, but according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm" title="And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.">1 Kings 5:17</a> <span class="ital">costly stones</span> (the same expression in Hebrew) were used for the foundations of the house.

What this word designates, or, if a place, where the place was, is not known. Gesenius ('Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub vet.</span>) would derive it from a Sanskrit word, purva, meaning "oriental." Hitzig suggests another Sanskrit word, <span class="accented">paru</span>, meaning "hill," and indicating the "twin hills" of Arabia (Prof., 6:7. &sect; 11) as the derivation. And Knobel suggests that it is a form of <span class="accented">Sepharvaim</span>, the Syriac and Jonathan Targum version of <span class="accented">Sephar</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-30.htm">Genesis 10:30</a>). The word does not occur in any other Bible passage (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. it. p. 711). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a> the short statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-2.htm">2 Chronicles 2:2</a> as to Solomon's statute labourers is again taken up and expanded. Solomon caused all the men to be numbered who dwelt in the land of Israel as strangers, viz., the descendants of the Canaanites who were not exterminated, "according to the numbering (&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; occurs only here) as his father David had numbered them." This remark refers to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>, where, however, it is only said that David commanded the strangers to be assembled. But as he caused them to be assembled in order to secure labourers for the building of the temple, he doubtless caused them to be numbered; and to this reference is here made. The numbering gave a total of 153,000 men, of whom 70,000 were made bearers of burdens, 80,000 &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, i.e., probably hewers of stone and wood &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;, i.e., on Lebanon, and 3600 foremen or overseers over the workmen, &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, to cause the people to work, that is, to hold them to their task. With this cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a>., where the number of the overseers is stated at 3300. This difference is explained by the fact that in the Chronicle the total number of overseers, of higher and lower rank, is given, while in the book of Kings only the number of overseers of the lower rank is given without the higher overseers. Solomon had in all 550 higher overseers of the builders (Israelite and Canaanite), - cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a>; and of these, 250 were Israelites, who alone are mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">2 Chronicles 8:10</a>, while the remaining 300 were Canaanites. The total number of overseers is the same in both accounts, - 3850; who are divided in the Chronicle into 3600 Canaanitish and 250 Israelitish, in the book of Kings into 3300 lower and 550 higher overseers (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-16.htm">1 Kings 5:16</a>). It is, moreover, stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-12.htm">1 Kings 5:12</a>. that Solomon had levied a force of 30,000 statute labourers from among the people of Israel, with the design that a third part of them, that is, 10,000 men, should labour alternately for a month at a time in Lebanon, looking after their own affairs at home during the two following months. This levy of workmen from among the people of Israel is not mentioned in the Chronicle. </body></html>
