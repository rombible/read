Measures and Ornaments of the House.<p>3. these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God&#8212;by the written plan and specifications given him by his father. The measurements are reckoned by cubits, "after the first measure," that is, the old Mosaic standard. But there is great difference of opinion about this, some making the cubit eighteen, others twenty-one inches. The temple, which embodied in more solid and durable materials the ground-form of the tabernacle (only being twice as large), was a rectangular building, seventy cubits long from east to west, and twenty cubits wide from north to south.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Solomon was instructed; </span> partly by his father David, and partly by the Spirit of God, which inspired and guided him in the whole work.

But how big those cubits were, and how much larger than the common cubits, and whether this was the cubit used by Moses in the building of the tabernacle, which seems most probable, or some other and yet larger cubit, is not agreed among learned men, and cannot now be exactly known, nor is it of any great moment for us to know. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now these <i>are the things wherein</i> Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God.

The verb is hoph. conjugation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> to "found;" and the purport of the clause is that Solomon <span class="accented">caused the foundations</span> of the building <span class="accented">to be laid</span> of such dimensions by cubit. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a> give the only other occurrences of the hoph. conjugation of this verb. <span class="cmt_word">Cubits after the first measure</span>. This possibly means the cubit of pre-Captivity times, but at all events the Israelites' own ancient cubit - perhaps a hand-breadth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>) longer than the present, or seven in place of six. The cubit (divided into six palms, and a palm into four finger-breadths) was the unit of Hebrew lineal measure. It stands for the length from the elbow to the wrist, the knuckle, or the tip of the longest finger. There is still considerable variation in opinion as to the number of inches that the cubit represents, and considerable perplexity as to the two or three different cubits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>) mentioned in Scripture. One of the latest authorities, Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., pp. 56-59, 371, 386), gives what seem to be reasons of almost decisive character for regarding the cubit of the temple buildings as one of sixteen inches. The subject is also discussed at length in Smith's ' Bible Dictionary,' 3:1736 - 1739. And the writer finally concludes to accept, under protest, Thenius's calculations, which give the cubit as rather over nineteen inches. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The answer of King Hiram; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7-11</a>. - Hiram answered &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;, in a writing, a letter, which he sent to Solomon. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a> Hiram first expresses his joy at Solomon's request, because it was of importance to him to be on a friendly footing with the king of Israel. In the Chronicle his writing begins with the congratulation: because Jahve loveth His people, hath He made thee king over them. Cf. for the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>. He then, according to both narratives, praises God that He has given David so wise a son. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-12.htm">2 Chronicles 2:12</a>, means: then he said further. The praise of God is heightened in the Chronicle by Hiram's entering into Solomon's religious ideas, calling Jahve the Creator of heaven and earth. Then, further, &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; is strengthened by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, having understanding and discernment; and this predicate is specially referred to Solomon's resolve to build a temple to the Lord. Then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>. he promises to send Solomon the artificer Huram-Abi. On the title &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, my father, i.e., minister, counsellor, and the descent of this man, cf. the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13-14</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a> of the Chronicle his artistic skill is described in terms coinciding with Solomon's wish in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>, only heightened by small additions. To the metals as materials in which he could work, there are added stone and wood work, and to the woven fabrics &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (byssus), the later word for &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;; and finally, to exhaust the whole, he is said to be able &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495; &#1493;&#1500;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to devise all manner of devices which shall be put to him, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>, he being thus raised to the level of Bezaleel, the chief artificer of the tabernacle. &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1498; is dependent upon &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>. The promise to send cedars and cypresses is for the sake of brevity here omitted, and only indirectly indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-15.htm">2 Chronicles 2:15</a>, however, it is mentioned that Hiram accepted the promised supply of grain, wine, and oil for the labourers; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a> closes with the promise to fell the wood required in Lebanon, and to cause it to be sent in floats to Joppa (Jaffa), whence Solomon could take it up to Jerusalem. The word &#1510;&#1512;&#1498;, "need," is a &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. in the Old Testament, but is very common in Aramaic writings. &#1512;&#1508;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, "floats," too, occurs only here instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>, and its etymology is unknown. If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-16</a> with the parallel account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8-11</a>, we find that, besides Hiram's somewhat verbose promise to fell the desired quantity of cedars and cypresses on Lebanon, and to send them in floats by sea to the place appointed by Solomon, the latter contains a request from Hiram that Solomon would give him &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, maintenance for his house, and a concluding remark that Hiram sent Solomon cedar wood, while Solomon gave Hiram, year by year, 20,000 kor of wheat as food for his house, i.e., the royal household, and twenty kor beaten oil, that is, of the finest oil. In the book of Kings, therefore, the promised wages of grain, wine, and oil, which were sent to the Tyrian woodcutters, is passed over, and only the quantity of wheat and finest oil which Solomon gave to the Tyrian king for his household, year by year, in return for the timber sent, is mentioned. In the Chronicle, on the contrary, only the wages or payment to the woodcutters is mentioned, and the return made for the building timber is not spoken of; but there is no reason for bringing these two passages, which treat of different things, into harmony by alterations of the text. For further discussion of this and of the measures, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>. </body></html>
