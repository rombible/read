The nails were used to fasten the golden plates to the wooden wainscoting of the edifice.<p>Whatever may be thought of the apparently incredible quantities of gold and silver stated to have been amassed by David for the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-14.htm" title="Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add thereto.">1Chronicles 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-4.htm" title="Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses with:">1Chronicles 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-7.htm" title="And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.">1Chronicles 29:7</a>), it is clear that no inconsiderable amount of the former metal would be required for the plating of the chambers as described in this chapter. And it is well known, from their own monuments, that the Babylonian sovereigns of a later age were in the habit of thus adorning the houses of their gods. Nebuchadnezzar, for instance, who restored the great temple of Borsippa, says: “E-zida, the strong house, in the midst thereof I caused to make, with silver, gold, alabaster, bronze . . . cedar I caused to adorn (or, completed) its <span class= "ital">sibir.</span> The cedar of the roof (?) of the shrines of Nebo with gold I caused to clothe.” In another inscription we read: “The shrine of Nebo, which is amid E-Sagili, its threshold, its bolt, and its <span class= "ital">babnaku,</span> with gold I caused to clothe.” And again: “The cedar roof of the oracle I caused to clothe with bright silver.” The Assyrian Esarhaddon, a century earlier, boasts that he built ten castles in Assyria and Accad, and “made them shine like day with silver and gold.”<p><span class= "bld">And he overlaid.</span>—<span class= "ital">And the upper chambers he covered with gold.</span> The chambers over the Holy of holies are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm" title="Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,">1Chronicles 28:11</a>. The two statements of this verse are peculiar to the chronicle. The Syriac and Arabic omit the verse.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_chronicles/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-17 The building of the temple. - There is a more particular account of the building of the temple in #1Ki 6". It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The upper chambers - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. Their position is uncertain. Some place them above the holy of holies, which was ten cubits, or fifteen feet lower than the main building (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>); others, accepting the height of the porch 120 cubits <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, regard the "upper chambers" or "chamber" &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  hupero&#772;on, Septuagint), as having been a lofty building erected over the entrance to the temple; others suggest that the chambers intended are simply the uppermost of the three sets of chambers which on three sides surrounded the temple (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-10</a>). This would seem to be the simplest and best explanation, though we cannot see any reason for the rich ornamentation of these apartments, or for David's special directions concerning them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 3:8-13.

This is the first mention of these "chambers" in the present description, but they have been alluded to by the Chronicle writer before, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. What or where they were is as yet not certainly ascertained. Presumably they were the highest tier of those chambers which surrounded three sides of the main building. But some think they were a superstructure to the holy of holies; others, high chambers in the supposed very lofty superstructure of the porch. Both of these suppositions seem to us of the unlikeliest. It would, however, be much more satisfactory, considering that all the subject before and after treats of the most holy place, to be able to connect this expression in some way with it, nor is there any reason evident for overlaying richly with gold the aforesaid chambers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a> compared with 2 Chronicles 22:11) of the third tier. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And this is Solomon's founding, to build the house of God;" i.e., this is the foundation which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God.
