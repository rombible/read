The fact that names were given them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>) suggests that they were symbols, perhaps of the presence of Jehovah; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-19.htm" title="In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.">Isaiah 19:19</a>, where a pillar, <span class="ital">maçççbâh</span>, is regarded (equally with an altar) as “a sign and witness unto the Lord.” Such a pillar might sometimes be used as an altar; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm" title="Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.">1 Chronicles 11:22</a> (note) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a>; and the “bowls” of the chapiters of Solomon’s two pillars may have been meant to contain something to be burnt in sacrifice. See Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Religion of the Semites</span>, p. 191, note 1, and Additional Note L, where there is an illustration of a coin shewing two detached pillars standing in front of the temple of Aphrodite at Paphos. The two pillars in the temple of Heracles at Tyre, of which Herodotus (2:44) speaks, were perhaps simply votive offerings.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty and five cubits</span>. The height of these pillars is attested in three places to have been 18 cubits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>). Some therefore think that the height given in our text describes rather the distance of the one pillar from the other, which would be just 35 cubits, if they stood at the extreme points of the line of the porch front; since the wings on each side (5 cubits for the lowest chamber, and 2.5 cubits for the thickness of the walls) would make up this amount. It is further noticed with this explanation that their height (18 cubits) with the chapiters (5 cubits) added, would bring them to the same height as the porch, and that their ornamentation agrees with that of the porch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a>). All this may be the case. Yet considering other indications of uncertainty about our text, and the fact that the characters <span class="accented">yod kheth</span> (18) are easily superseded by <span class="accented">lamed he</span> (35), it is perhaps likelier that we have here simply a clerical error. The parallel place tells us that these pillars and the chapiters were cast of brass; that "a line [<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>; Jeremiah 52:41] of twelve cubits [not seven] did compass either of them about;" that the ornamentation of each chapiter was "a net of checker-work, and a wreath of chain-work;" that upon the five cubits of chapiter there was another "four cubits of lily-work," etc. If this last feature apply to the two pillars, and not (as some think) to the porch only, the pillars would reach a height of 27 cubits, and if it be supposed that they stood on some stone or other superstructure, it may still be that our "thirty-five cubits" has its meaning. Meantime the passage in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 52:41) tells us that the pillars were hollow, and that the thickness of the metal was "four fingers." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The most holy place, with the figures of the cherubim and the veil; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-19.htm">1 Kings 6:19-28</a>. - The length of the most holy place in front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, consequently measured in the same way as the porch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>); the breadth, i.e., the depth of it, also twenty cubits. The height, which was the same (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>), is not stated; but instead of that we have the weight of the gold which was used for the gilding, which is omitted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6</a>, viz., 600 talents for the overlaying of the walls, and 50 shekels for the nails to fasten the sheet gold on the wainscotting.
