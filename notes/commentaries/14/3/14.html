It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which he had purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is an important addition to the description in Kings, where the veil is not mentioned.

It is remarkable that our parallel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6</a>.) does not make mention of the veil, though a feature of which so much was always made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-38.htm">Mark 15:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-45.htm">Luke 23:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-3.htm">Hebrews 9:3</a>). On the other hand, it is remarkable that our present passage does not make mention of the folding "doors of olive tree," which, with "the veil," intercepted the approach to the oracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31, 32</a>), nor of the partition walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>) in which they were situate, nor of the "partition chains [<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-21.htm">1 Kings 6:21</a>] of gold before the oracle." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The most holy place, with the figures of the cherubim and the veil; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-19.htm">1 Kings 6:19-28</a>. - The length of the most holy place in front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, consequently measured in the same way as the porch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>); the breadth, i.e., the depth of it, also twenty cubits. The height, which was the same (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>), is not stated; but instead of that we have the weight of the gold which was used for the gilding, which is omitted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6</a>, viz., 600 talents for the overlaying of the walls, and 50 shekels for the nails to fasten the sheet gold on the wainscotting.
