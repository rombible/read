Full instructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and to proceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enough to render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Let us search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us to understand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way may be made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him. Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that of Solomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wings of the cherubims - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-24.htm">1 Kings 6:24-27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13. two cherubims&#8212;These figures in the tabernacle were of pure gold (Ex 25:1-40) and overshadowed the mercy seat.
