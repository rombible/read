True wisdom and happiness are always united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth and power to one who he knew would be a fool! Ec 2:18,19. This was not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the kings of the earth - Rather, "all the kings of the land:" all the monarchs, that is, whose dominions were included in So omon's empire (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. the king's ships went to Tarshish&#8212;rather, "the king's ships of Tarshish went" with the servants of Huram.<p>ships of Tarshish&#8212;that is, in burden and construction like the large vessels built for or used at Tarshish [Calmet, Fragments].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">his present</span>] i.e. his tribute.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">harness</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">armour</span> (so Pesh. of 1 Kin. and Targ. of 2 Chr. and 1 Kin.).
