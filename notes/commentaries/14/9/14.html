The conjecture of Thenius on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm" title="Beside that he had of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.">1Kings 10:15</a> seems to be borne out by the ancient Versions. He would read instead of <span class= "ital">’anshê ha-tārîm,</span> “men of the travellers,” <span class= "ital">‘onshê ha-r’dûyîm, “fines</span> or tributes <span class= "ital">of the subjects.”</span> The Syriac of Chronicles has “tributes of the cities.” Perhaps, therefore, the true original reading was <span class= "ital">‘onshê he‘arîm.</span> The Vulg. renders “envoys of divers peoples;” but the LXX., “<span class= "ital">men of the subjected</span> (states).”<p>For the second half of the phrase Kings has, “and the merchandise of the pedlars.”<p><span class= "bld">The kings of Arabia.</span>—Kings, “the kings of the mixed tribes;” that is, the <span class= "ital">Bêdâwîs,</span> bordering on and <span class= "ital">mingling</span> with Israel. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm" title="And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.">Exodus 12:38</a>.) The difference depends on the vowel pointing only. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm" title="And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,">Jeremiah 25:24</a>, where both words occur; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm" title="Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.">Ezekiel 30:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Governors.</span>—<span class= "ital">Pachôth,</span> i.e., pashas. Thenius is wrong in supposing this word to be a token of the “later composition of the section.” (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-24.htm" title="How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?">2Kings 18:24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Brought.</span>—<span class= "ital">Were bringing =</span> used to bring.

True wisdom and happiness are always united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth and power to one who he knew would be a fool! Ec 2:18,19. This was not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beside that which she had brought unto the king - It is difficult to assign any sense to these words as they now stand in the Hebrew text.

For this unusual and un-Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>. Gesenius mentions Turkish, Persian, and Sanscrit derivations that would well suit it. It is very noticeable that it is employed also by the writer of Kings. It is used of a ruler in the Assyrian empire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-24.htm">2 Kings 18:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>), in the Chaldean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a>), in the Persian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-3.htm">Esther 9:3</a>), specially of the Persian governor of Judaea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-2.htm">Haggai 2:2, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-26.htm">Nehemiah 12:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>); while Gesenius reads this passage in our present text and its parallel, to speak of governors of <span class="accented">Judaea</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">country</span>). See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-24.htm">1 Kings 20:24</a>, where the word is translated (Authorized Version) "captains," and is in the Syrian king's mouth. The word is not used before Kings. It is used by the writer of Kings three times; of Chronicles, once; by Ezra, six times; in Nehemiah, eight times; in Esther, three times; in Daniel, four times; and in the remaining prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai, Malachi, ten times in all. The Authorized Version, out of the whole number of these occurrences of the word, has rendered it "captains" thirteen times; "deputies," twice; and "governors," twenty times. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The visit of the queen of Sheba.
