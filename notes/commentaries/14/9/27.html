True wisdom and happiness are always united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth and power to one who he knew would be a fool! Ec 2:18,19. This was not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the kings of the earth - Rather, "all the kings of the land:" all the monarchs, that is, whose dominions were included in So omon's empire (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. Solomon had four thousand stalls&#8212;It has been conjectured [Gesenius, Hebrew Lexicon] that the original term may signify not only stall or stable, but a number of horses occupying the same number of stalls. Supposing that ten were put together in one part, this would make forty thousand. According to this theory of explanation, the historian in Kings refers to horses [see 1Ki 10:26]; while the historian in Chronicles speaks of the stalls in which they were kept. But more recent critics reject this mode of solving the difficulty, and, regarding the four thousand stalls as in keeping with the general magnificence of Solomon's establishments, are agreed in considering the text in Kings as corrupt, through the error of some copyist.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the king made silver in Jerusalem <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that <i>are</i> in the low plains in abundance.</span><p>(n) The abundance of those temporal treasures in Solomon's kingdom is a figure of the spiritual treasures which the elect will enjoy in the heavens under the true Solomon, Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">cedar trees</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">cedar wood</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sycomore</span>] i.e. the fig-mulberry, not now a common tree in Palestine; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-28.htm" title="And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>, note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the low plains</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the lowland</span> (Heb. “Shephelah”).
