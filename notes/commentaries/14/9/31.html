True wisdom and happiness are always united together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and the enjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselves with the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomon reigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of which could never since be found; for the most known of the great princes of the earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned forty years in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would give him riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. The lustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of the kingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne, which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all his wealth and power to one who he knew would be a fool! Ec 2:18,19. This was not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, nor wisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks be to God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over this dreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The book of Nathan ... - On the "books" here mentioned, see the introduction to Chronicles, the second note.<p>We hear nothing of Iddo in Kings: but he is mentioned below twice <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>.

Solomon undoubtedly carried the Hebrew kingdom to its highest pitch of worldly glory. His completion of the grand work, the centralizing of the national worship at Jerusalem, whither the natives went up three times a year, has given his name a prominent place in the history of the ancient church. But his reign had a disastrous influence upon "the peculiar people," and the example of his deplorable idolatries, the connections he formed with foreign princes, the commercial speculations he entered into, and the luxuries introduced into the land, seem in a great measure to have altered and deteriorated the Jewish character.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Chapter Introduction <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_chronicles/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">slept with his fathers</span>] This is not said of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-28.htm" title="And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.">1 Chronicles 29:28</a>), perhaps because David’s father was not a king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the city of David</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-7.htm" title="And David dwelled in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.">1 Chronicles 11:7</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a> does not correspond to the passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>, but in contents and language agrees with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>.
