Ahaziah gave himself up to be led by evil men. Those who advise us to do wickedly, counsel us to our destruction; while they pretend to be friends, they are our worst enemies. See and dread the mischief of bad company. If not the infection, yet let the destruction be feared, Re 18:4. We have here, a wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of David, and a good woman preserving it. No word of God shall fall to the ground. The whole truth of the prophecies that the Messiah was to come from David, and thereby the salvation of the world, appeared to be now hung upon the brittle thread of the life of a single infant, to destroy whom was the interest of the reigning power.

How far this counsel led to his destruction is narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a> and onwards, and the narrative is introduced by the words, "He walked also in their counsel;" whence it is clear beyond all doubt, that Ahaziah entered along with Joram, Ahab's son, upon the war which was to bring about the destruction of Ahab's house, and to cost him his life, on the advice of Ahab's relations. There is no doubt that Joram, Ahab's son, had called upon Ahaziah to take part in the war against the Syrians at Ramoth Gilead (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-28.htm">2 Chronicles 18:28</a>), and that Athaliah with her party supported his proposal, so that Ahaziah complied. In the war the Aramaeans (Syrians) smote Joram; i.e., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-6.htm">2 Chronicles 22:6</a>, they wounded him (&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is a contraction for &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28</a>). In consequence of this Joram returned to Jezreel, the summer residence of the Ahabic royal house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-45.htm">1 Kings 18:45</a>), the present Zerin; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; has no meaning, and is merely an error for &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1503;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a>, which indeed is the reading of several Codd.: to let himself be cured of his strokes (wounds). &#1493;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, too, is an orthographical error for &#1493;&#1506;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;: and Ahaziah went down to visit the wounded Joram, his brother-in-law. Whether he went from Jerusalem or from the loftily-situated Ramah cannot be with certainty determined, for we have no special account of the course of the war, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>. we only learn that the Israelite army remained in Ramoth after the return of the wounded Joram. It is therefore probable that Ahaziah went direct from Ramoth to visit Joram, but it is not ascertained; for there is nothing opposed to the supposition that, after Joram had been wounded in the battle, and while the Israelite host remained to hold the city against the Syrian king Hazael, Ahaziah had returned to his capital, and thence went after some time to visit the wounded Joram in Jezreel.</body></html>
