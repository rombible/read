Ahaziah gave himself up to be led by evil men. Those who advise us to do wickedly, counsel us to our destruction; while they pretend to be friends, they are our worst enemies. See and dread the mischief of bad company. If not the infection, yet let the destruction be feared, Re 18:4. We have here, a wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of David, and a good woman preserving it. No word of God shall fall to the ground. The whole truth of the prophecies that the Messiah was to come from David, and thereby the salvation of the world, appeared to be now hung upon the brittle thread of the life of a single infant, to destroy whom was the interest of the reigning power.

Athaliah, Destroying the Seed Royal Save Joash, Usurps the Kingdom.<p>10. Athaliah &#8230; arose and destroyed all the seed royal&#8212;(See on [445]2Ki 11:1-3). Maddened by the massacre of the royal family of Ahab, she resolved that the royal house of David should have the same fate. Knowing the commission which Jehu had received to extirpate the whole of Ahab's posterity, she expected that he would extend his sword to her. Anticipating his movements, she resolved, as her only defense and security, to usurp the throne and destroy "the seed royal," both because they were hostile to the Phœnician worship of Baal, which she was determined to uphold, and because, if one of the young princes became king, his mother would supersede Athaliah in the dignity of queen mother.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he sought Ahaziah,....

We are here told, what is not mentioned in the parallel, that Jehosheba was "wife of Jehoiada the priest," probably the high priest.

How far this counsel led to his destruction is narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a> and onwards, and the narrative is introduced by the words, "He walked also in their counsel;" whence it is clear beyond all doubt, that Ahaziah entered along with Joram, Ahab's son, upon the war which was to bring about the destruction of Ahab's house, and to cost him his life, on the advice of Ahab's relations. There is no doubt that Joram, Ahab's son, had called upon Ahaziah to take part in the war against the Syrians at Ramoth Gilead (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-28.htm">2 Chronicles 18:28</a>), and that Athaliah with her party supported his proposal, so that Ahaziah complied. In the war the Aramaeans (Syrians) smote Joram; i.e., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-6.htm">2 Chronicles 22:6</a>, they wounded him (&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is a contraction for &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28</a>).

Whether he went from Jerusalem or from the loftily-situated Ramah cannot be with certainty determined, for we have no special account of the course of the war, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>. we only learn that the Israelite army remained in Ramoth after the return of the wounded Joram. It is therefore probable that Ahaziah went direct from Ramoth to visit Joram, but it is not ascertained; for there is nothing opposed to the supposition that, after Joram had been wounded in the battle, and while the Israelite host remained to hold the city against the Syrian king Hazael, Ahaziah had returned to his capital, and thence went after some time to visit the wounded Joram in Jezreel.</body></html>
