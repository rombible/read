In &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; we have a hint that Ahaziah's succession was disputed or doubtful; for where the son follows the father on the throne without opposition, it is simply said in the Chronicle also, "and his son was king in his stead." But the only person who could contest the throne with Ahaziah, since all the other sons of Joram who would have had claims upon it were not then alive, was his mother Athaliah, who usurped the throne after his death. All the elder sons (&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the earlier born) were slain by the troop which had come among (with) the Arabians (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>.) into the camp, - not of the Philistines (Cler.), but of the men of Judah; that is, they were slain by a reconnoitring party, which, in the invasion of Judah by the Philistines and Arabs, surprised the camp of the men of Judah, and slew the elder sons of Joram, who had marched to the war. Probably they did not cut them down on the spot, but (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>) took them prisoners and slew them afterwards.</body></html>
