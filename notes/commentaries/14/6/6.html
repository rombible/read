First and chiefly, he prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing, and the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays for temporal mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desire most in our prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfect pattern and form of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward, and all the rest are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified the human nature of Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. The ark typified his obedience and sufferings, by which repenting sinners have access to a reconciled God, and communion with him. Jehovah has made our nature his resting-place for ever, in the person of Emmanuel, and through him he dwells with, and delights in his church of redeemed sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place; may Christ dwell therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples, and shedding abroad his love therein. May the Father look upon us in and through his Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in all things, according to his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare Kings (marginal references).<p>Compare Kings (marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>2Ch 6:1-41.

The Lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness&#8212;This introduction to Solomon's address was evidently suggested by the remarkable incident recorded at the close of the last chapter: the phenomenon of a densely opaque and uniformly shaped cloud, descending in a slow and majestic manner and filling the whole area of the temple. He regarded it himself, and directed the people also to regard it, as an undoubted sign and welcome pledge of the divine presence and acceptance of the building reared to His honor and worship. He referred not to any particular declaration of God, but to the cloud having been all along in the national history of Israel the recognized symbol of the divine presence (Ex 16:10; 24:16; 40:34; Nu 9:15; 1Ki 8:10, 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_chronicles/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_chronicles/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See Introduction to Chapter 5 <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_chronicles/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - (See again references of preceding verse, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>.)
