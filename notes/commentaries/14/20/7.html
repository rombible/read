Hence the advantage of days for national fasting and prayer. From the first to the last of our seeking the Lord, we must approach him with humiliation for our sins, trusting only in his mercy and power. Jehoshaphat acknowledges the sovereign dominion of the Divine Providence. Lord, exert it on our behalf. Whom should we seek to, whom should we trust to for relief, but the God we have chosen and served. Those that use what they have for God, may comfortably hope he will secure it to them. Every true believer is a son of Abraham, a friend of God; with such the everlasting covenant is established, to such every promise belongs. We are assured of God's love, by his dwelling in human nature in the person of the Saviour. Jehoshaphat mentions the temple, as a token of God's favourable presence. He pleads the injustice of his enemies. We may well appeal to God against those that render us evil for good. Though he had a great army, he said, We have no might without thee; we rely upon thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham thy friend - Historically, this is the first use of this remarkable expression, afterward repeated (marginal references).

Along with the Moabites and Ammonites there marched against Jehoshaphat also &#1502;&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. This statement is obscure. Since &#1502;&#1503; has unquestionably a partitive or local signification, we might take the word to signify, enemies who dwelt aside from the Ammonites (&#1502;&#1503; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-22.htm">1 Samuel 20:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-37.htm">1 Samuel 20:37</a>), which might possibly be the designation of tribes in the Syro-Arabic desert bordering upon the country of the Ammonites on the north and east; and &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a> would seem to favour this idea. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>. are scarcely reconcilable with this interpretation, since there, besides or along with the sons of Ammon and Moab, inhabitants of Mount Seir are named as enemies who had invaded Judah. Now the Edomites dwelt on Mount Seir; but had the Edomites only been allies of the Ammonites and Moabites, we should expect simply &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; or &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, or &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-11.htm">2 Chronicles 25:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>). Nor can it be denied that the interpretation which makes &#1502;&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; to denote peoples dwelling beyond the Ammonites is somewhat artificial and far-fetched. Under these circumstances, the alteration proposed by Hiller in Onomast. p. 285 commends itself, viz., the change of &#1502;&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, Maunites or Maonites, - a tribe whose headquarters were the city Maan in the neighbourhood of Petra, to the east of the Wady Musa; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41</a>. Maan lay upon Mount Seir, i.e., in the mountainous district to the west of the Arabah, which stretches upwards from the head of the Dead Sea to the Elanitic Gulf, now called Jebl (Gebalene) in its northern part, and es-Sherah in the south. The Maunites were consequently inhabitants of Mount Seir, and are here mentioned instead of the Edomites, as being a people dwelling on the southern side of the mountain, and probably of non-Edomitic origin, in order to express the idea that not merely the Edomites took part in the campaign of the Ammonites and Moabites, but also tribes from all parts of Mount Seir. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a> the &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are mentioned along with Arabs and Philistines as enemies of Israel, who had been conquered by Uzziah. These circumstances favour the proposed alteration; while, on the contrary, the fact that the lxx have here &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x39c;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; for &#1502;&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; proves little, since these translators have rendered &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a> also by &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x39c;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, there erroneously making the Ammonites Minaiites. </body></html>
