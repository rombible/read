But after God had done such great things for him, given him not only victory, but wealth; after this, to go and join himself with a wicked king, was very ungrateful. What could he expect but that God would be angry with him? Yet it seems, he took the warning; for when Ahaziah afterward pressed him to join him, he would not, 1Ki 22:49. Thus the alliance was broken, and the Divine rebuke had its effect, at least for a season. Let us be thankful for any losses which may have prevented the loss of our immortal souls. Let us praise the Lord, who sought after us, and left us not to perish in our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The valley of Berachah - Probably, the Wady Bereikut, which lies at a short distance from Tekoa toward the northwest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_chronicles/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ch 20:31-37.

The mention of &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as part of the booty, between &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; and the precious vessels, is somewhat surprising. Some Codd. (4 Kennic. and 3 de Rossi) and various ancient editions (Complut., the Brixenian used by Luther, the Bomberg. of date 1518 and 21, and the Mnster) have, instead of it, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;; but it is very questionable if the lxx and Vulg. have it (cf. de Rossi Variae Lectt. ad h. l.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, garments, along with &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, moveable property (cattle, tents, etc.), seems to suit better, and is therefore held by Dathe and Berth. to be the correct and original reading. Yet the proofs of this are not decisive, for &#1508;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is much better attested, and we need not necessarily take &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; to mean living and dead cattle; but just as &#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; denotes property of any kind, which, among nomadic tribes, consists principally in cattle, we may also take &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in the signification of slain men and beasts - the clothes of the men and the accoutrements and ornaments of the beasts (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>) being a by no means worthless booty. Garments as such are not elsewhere met with in enumerations of things taken as booty, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a> only the purple robes of the Midianite princes being spoken of; and to the remark that the before-mentioned &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; has given rise to the changing of &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, we may oppose the equally well-supported conjecture, that the apparently unsuitable meaning of the word &#1508;&#1490;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; may have given rise to the alteration of it into &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; are probably in the main gold and silver ornaments, such as are enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-25.htm">Judges 8:25</a>. And they spoiled for themselves &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, "there was not carrying," i.e., in such abundance that it could not be carried away, removed, and plundered in three days, because the booty was so great. The unusually large quantity of booty is accounted for by the fact that these peoples had gone forth with all their property to drive the Israelites out of their inheritance, and to take possession of their land for themselves; so that this invasion of Judah was a kind of migration of the peoples, such as those which, at a later time, have been repeated on a gigantic scale, and have poured forth from Central Asia over the whole of Europe. In this, the purpose of the hostile hordes, we must seek the reason for their destruction by a miracle wrought of God. Because they intended to drive the people of Israel out of the land given them by God, and to destroy them, the Lord was compelled to come to the help of His people, and to destroy their enemies. </body></html>
