Hence the advantage of days for national fasting and prayer. From the first to the last of our seeking the Lord, we must approach him with humiliation for our sins, trusting only in his mercy and power. Jehoshaphat acknowledges the sovereign dominion of the Divine Providence. Lord, exert it on our behalf. Whom should we seek to, whom should we trust to for relief, but the God we have chosen and served. Those that use what they have for God, may comfortably hope he will secure it to them. Every true believer is a son of Abraham, a friend of God; with such the everlasting covenant is established, to such every promise belongs. We are assured of God's love, by his dwelling in human nature in the person of the Saviour. Jehoshaphat mentions the temple, as a token of God's favourable presence. He pleads the injustice of his enemies. We may well appeal to God against those that render us evil for good. Though he had a great army, he said, We have no might without thee; we rely upon thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Maonites of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1</a> are here, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-23</a>, called the "children" or inhabitants "of mount Seir."

Jahve had given the land to His people Israel for an everlasting possession, and Israel had built a sanctuary to His name therein (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-8.htm">2 Chronicles 20:8</a>); but they had in no way provoked the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites to fall upon them, and to drive them out of their land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-11.htm">2 Chronicles 20:11</a>). On these two facts Jehoshaphat founds his prayer for help, in a twofold manner: in respect to the first, calling to mind the divine promise to hear the prayers offered up to God in the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-9.htm">2 Chronicles 20:9</a>); and in reference to the second, laying emphasis upon the inability of Israel to fight against so numerous an enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>). In his manner of addressing Jahve, "God of our fathers," there is contained a reason why God should protect His people in their present distress. Upon Him, who had given the land to the fathers for a possession, it was incumbent to maintain the children in the enjoyment of it, if they had not forfeited it by their sins. Now Jahve as a covenant God was bound to do this, and also as God and ruler of heaven and earth He had the requisite power and might; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>. &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, there is none with Thee who could set himself, i.e., could withstand Thee: cf. the similar phrase, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-10.htm">2 Chronicles 14:10</a>; and for the thought, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>. - On <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-9.htm">Joshua 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-12.htm">Joshua 24:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>., etc.; on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-18.htm">2 Chronicles 15:18</a>, etc.; on &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>. </body></html>
