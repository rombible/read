Hence the advantage of days for national fasting and prayer. From the first to the last of our seeking the Lord, we must approach him with humiliation for our sins, trusting only in his mercy and power. Jehoshaphat acknowledges the sovereign dominion of the Divine Providence. Lord, exert it on our behalf. Whom should we seek to, whom should we trust to for relief, but the God we have chosen and served. Those that use what they have for God, may comfortably hope he will secure it to them. Every true believer is a son of Abraham, a friend of God; with such the everlasting covenant is established, to such every promise belongs. We are assured of God's love, by his dwelling in human nature in the person of the Saviour. Jehoshaphat mentions the temple, as a token of God's favourable presence. He pleads the injustice of his enemies. We may well appeal to God against those that render us evil for good. Though he had a great army, he said, We have no might without thee; we rely upon thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_chronicles/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The new court - In Solomon's Temple there were two courts.

The Heb. word for “court” here is <span class="ital">ḥâçer</span>, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-9.htm" title="Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.">2 Chronicles 4:9</a> (see note there) the “court (<span class="ital">ḥâççr</span>) of the priests” is distinguished from a court called the “great court” (Heb. “great <span class="ital">Azârâh</span>”). Perhaps the Chronicler means here “the <span class="ital">ḥâççr</span> of the priests” for Jehoshaphat stands not <span class="ital">in</span> but <span class="ital">before</span> it. Solomon’s great prayer was offered according to the Chronicler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm" title="For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court: and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>) in “the court” (Heb. <span class="ital">Azârâh</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5–13 (no parallel in Kings).

The w before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; is explicative, namely, and is omitted by the lxx and Vulg. as superfluous. "Every cause which comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities" (and bring causes before the superior court in the following cases): between blood and blood (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; with &#1500; following, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a>, etc.), i.e., in criminal cases of murder and manslaughter, and between law and between command, statutes, and judgments, i.e., in cases where the matter concerns the interpretation and application of the law, and its individual commands, statutes, and judgments, to particular crimes; wherever, in short, there is any doubt by what particular provision of the law the case in hand should be decided. With &#1493;&#1492;&#1494;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; the apodosis commences, but it is an anacolouthon. Instead of "ye shall give them instruction therein," we have, "ye shall teach them (those who bring the cause before you), that they incur not guilt, and an anger (i.e., God's anger and punishment) come upon you and your brethren" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). &#1492;&#1494;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512;, properly to illuminate, metaphorically to teach, with the additional idea of exhortation or warning. The word is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-20.htm">Exodus 18:20</a>, and there is construed c. accus. pers. et rei. This construction is here also the underlying one, since the object which precedes in the absolute is to be taken as accus.: thus, and as regards every cause, ye shall teach them concerning it. After the enumeration of the matters falling within the jurisdiction of this court, &#1514;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is repeated, and this precept is then pressed home upon the judges by the words, "that ye incur not guilt." Thereafter (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm">2 Chronicles 19:11</a>) Jehoshaphat nominates the spiritual and civil presidents of this tribunal: for spiritual causes the high priest Amariah, who is not the same as the Amariah mentioned after Zadok as the fifth high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-11.htm">1 Chronicles 6:11</a>); in civil causes Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the prince of the house of Judah, i.e., tribal prince of Judah. These shall be &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; over you, i.e., presidents of the judges; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, writers, shall the Levites be &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, before you, i.e., as your assistants and servants. Jehoshaphat concludes the nomination of the judicial staff with the encouraging words, "Be strong (courageous) and do," i.e., go to work with good heart, "and the Lord be with the good," i.e., with him who discharges the duties of his office well.<p>The establishment of this superior court was in form, indeed, the commencement of a new institution; but in reality it was only the expansion or firmer organization of a court of final appeal already provided by Moses, the duties of which had been until then performed partly by the high priest, partly by the existing civil heads of the people (the judges and kings). When Moses, at Horeb, set judges over the people, he commanded them to bring to him the matters which were too difficult for them to decide, that he might settle them according to decisions obtained of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-26.htm">Exodus 18:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19</a>). At a later time he ordained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>.) that for the future the judges in the various districts and cities should bring the more difficult cases to the Levitic priests and the judge at the place where the central sanctuary was, and let them be decided by them. In thus arranging, he presupposes that Israel would have at all times not only a high priest who might ascertain the will of God by means of the Urim and Thummim, but also a supreme director of its civil affairs at the place of the central sanctuary, who, in common with the priests, i.e., the high priest, would give decisions in cases of final appeal (see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>). On the basis of these Mosaic arrangements, Jehoshaphat set up a supreme court in Jerusalem, with the high priest and a lay president at its head, for the decision of causes which up till that time the king, either alone with the cooperation of the high priest, had decided. For further information as to this supreme court, see in my bibl. Archol. ii. S. 250f. </body></html>
