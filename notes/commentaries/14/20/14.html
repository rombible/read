In this verse, the cases enumerated in Solomon's dedicatory prayer, in which supplication is made that God would hear in the temple, are briefly summed up. By referring to that prayer, Jehoshaphat presupposes that Jahve had promised that He would answer prayer offered there, since He had filled the temple with His glory; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1-3</a>.
