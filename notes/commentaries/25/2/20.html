We learn from this, 1st, That the Chaldeans spared no character, no, not the most distinguished; even <span class="ital">the priest </span>and <span class="ital">the prophet, </span>who, of all men, one would think, might have expected protection from heaven, and veneration on earth, yet they were slain; not abroad in the field of battle, where they would have been out of their place, as Hophni and Phinehas were, but in the sanctuary of the Lord, the place of their business, and which they hoped would have been a refuge to them. 2d, They spared no age, no, not those who, by reason of their tender or decrepit age, were exempted from taking up the sword; for <span class="ital">the young and the old lay on the ground slain in the streets. </span>3d, They spared no sex, <span class="ital">the virgins and the young men fell by the sword. </span>In the most barbarous military executions that we read of, the virgins were spared and made part of the spoil, but here they were put to the sword as well as the young men. We learn, 4th, That this was the Lord’s doing; he suffered the sword of the Chaldeans to devour thus without distinction; <span class="ital">he slew them in the day of his anger — </span>Namely, his anger for their many and aggravated sins. <span class="ital">Thou hast called, as in a solemn day — </span>A day of awful retribution; <span class="ital">my terrors round about — </span>As my people were wont to be called together from all parts on solemn days, when they were to meet at Jerusalem for thy service; so now, by thy providence, my terrible enemies are by thee called together to slay thy people in that holy city in which they were wont to worship thee. <span class="ital">So that none escaped nor remained — </span>That is, few or none. <span class="ital">Those that I have swaddled, and brought up, hath mine enemy consumed — </span>As if they had been brought forth for the murderer, like lambs for the butcher, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-13.htm" title="Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.">Hosea 9:13</a>.

Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done.

On whom thou hast brought these calamities of famine and sword; not upon thine enemies, but upon thine own people, that are called by thy name, and upon theirs, their young ones, who had not sinned as their fathers had: here the church does not charge God with any injustice, or complain of hard usage; only humbly entreats he would look upon her, in her misery, with an eye of pity and compassion; and consider her sorrowful condition; and remember the relation she stood in to him; and so submits her case, and leaves it with him. These words seem to be suggested to the church by the prophet, as what might be proper for her to use, when praying for the life of her young children; and might be introduced by supplying the word "saying" before "behold, O Lord", &amp;c. <p>shall the women eat their fruit; their children, the fruit of their womb, as the Targum; their newborn babes, that hung at their breasts, and were carried in their arms; it seems they did, as was threatened they should, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a>; and so they did at the siege of Samaria, and at the siege of Jerusalem, both by the Chaldeans and the Romans: <p>and children of a span long? or of a hand's breadth; the breadth of the palms of the hand, denoting very little ones: or "children handled", or "swaddled with the hands" (c); of their parents, who are used to stroke the limbs of their babes, to bring them to; and keep them in right form and shape, and swaddle them with swaddling bands in a proper manner; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-22.htm">Lamentations 2:22</a>; and so the Targum, <p>"desirable children, who are wrapped in fine linen.'' <p>Jarchi (d) interprets it of Doeg Ben Joseph, whom his mother slew, and ate: <p>shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? as very probably some were, who fled thither for safety when the city was broken up; but were not spared by the merciless Chaldeans, who had no regard to their office and character; nor is it any wonder they should not, when the Jews themselves slew Zechariah, a priest and prophet, between the porch and the altar; of whom the Targum here makes mention; and to whom Jarchi applies these words. <p>(c)  "parvulos qui educantur", Pagninus; "parvulos educationum", Montanus; "educationis", Calvin; "infantes palmationum, sive tractationis palmarum", Michaelis; "pueros palmis tractatos", Cocceius.

For they have brought this calamity upon her through their careless and foolish prophesyings. Those meant are the false prophets, whose conduct Jeremiah frequently denounced; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-12.htm">Jeremiah 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-32.htm">Jeremiah 23:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-10.htm">Jeremiah 27:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-15.htm">Jeremiah 27:15</a>. They prophesied vanity, - peace when there was no peace, - and &#1514;&#1508;&#1500;, "absurdity,"  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-13.htm">Jeremiah 23:13</a>. They did not expose the sin and guilt of the people with the view of their amendment and improvement, and thereby removing the misery into which they had fallen by their sin; nor did they endeavour to restore the people to their right relation towards the Lord, upon which their welfare depended, or to avert their being driven into exile. On &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>. The meaning of this expression, as there unfolded, applies also to the passage now before us; and the translation, captivitatem avertere (Michaelis, Ngelsbach), or to "ward off thy captivity" (Luther, Thenius), is neither capable of vindication nor required by the context. Instead of healing the injuries of the people by discovering their sins, they have seen (prophesied) for them &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, "burdens," i.e., utterances of threatening import (not effata; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-33.htm">Jeremiah 23:33</a>), which contained &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;, "emptiness," and &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, "rejection." The combination of "emptiness" with "burdens" does not prevent the latter word from being applied to threatening oracles; for the threats of the false prophets did not refer to Judah, but were directed against the enemies of Israel. For instance, that they might promise the people speedy deliverance from exile, they placed the downfall of the Chaldean power in immediate prospect; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-2.htm">Jeremiah 28:2-4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-11.htm">Jeremiah 28:11</a>. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, is &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. as a noun, and is also dependent on "burdens" (cf. Ewald, 289, c): it signifies ejection from the land, not "persecution" (Rosenmller, Gesenius, Ewald, etc.), for Jeremiah uses &#1504;&#1491;&#1495; (in Niph. and Hiph.) always in the sense of rejection, expulsion from the country; and the word has here an unmistakeable reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-10.htm">Jeremiah 27:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-15.htm">Jeremiah 27:15</a> : "They prophesy lies to you, that they may eject you from your country."</body></html>
