And it was at least a pardonable partiality in them, which led them to pass these encomiums upon it, and to suppose that all strangers would be equally delighted with its beauty as they themselves were. It was the metropolis of their nation, and the city their God had chosen to put his name there. There was his magnificent temple, and there the symbols of his divine presence, and the administration of the ordinances of his worship. Thither the whole nation resorted, according to his appointment, to celebrate their solemn feasts: and there those feasts were observed with all the magnificence of religious joy.

Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done.

The expression &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; represents this as the execution of a divine decree, - a turn which forms an appropriate introduction to the close of the work of destruction. "Raschi makes the following remark concerning this: a longo inde tempore, in animum induxerat, hanc urbem vastare secundum illud quod <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-31.htm">Jeremiah 32:31</a> dixit. This intention He has now carried out. The words, "He stretched out the measuring-line," are more exactly determined by what follows, "He withdrew not His hand from destroying;" this shows the extent to which the destruction was carried out. The measuring-line was drawn out for the purpose of determining the situation and direction of buildings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-5.htm">Job 38:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>); but Jahveh applies it also for the purpose of pulling down buildings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>), in order to indicate that He carried out the destruction with the same precision as that of the builder in finishing his work. The rampart and the wall sorrow over this. &#1495;&#1500; (from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;) is the rampart, i.e., the low wall with the ditch, surrounding the fortress outside the city wall; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>. The gates of the daughter of Zion (i.e., of Jerusalem) are sunk into the earth, i.e., have been completely buried under rubbish by the demolition, as if they had sunk into the ground. The subject to &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is Jahveh. The bars of the daughter of Zion are those with which the city gates were closed, for the protection of the inhabitants. With the destruction of Jerusalem the kingdom of God is destroyed. King and princes are among the heathen, - carried away into exile. It must, indeed, be allowed that &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is connected by the accents with what precedes; and Gerlach defends the construction, "they are among the heathen without law,", - not only agreeing with Kalkschmidt in taking &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; as a designation of the &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; as ethnici, - -ad gentes, quibus divina nulla erat revelatio, - but also with Luther, who translates: "her king and her princes are among the heathen, because they cannot administer the law," or generally, have it not. But, on the other hand, the accents merely indicate the stichometrical arrangement, not the relation of the words according to their sense; and the remark, "that <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a> sets forth the fate of the persons who stood to the city in the relation of helpers and counsellors or comforters (her king, her prophets), of whose help (counsel, or comfort) the city was deprived, as well as of the external means of defending her" (first member), proves nothing at all, for the simple reason that the priests also belonged to the number of the helpers, counsellors, and comforters of the city; hence, if this were the meaning, and the two halves of the verse were meant to stand in this relation, then the priests would certainly have been mentioned also. The second half of the verse is not connected with the first in the manner supposed by Gerlach; but, from the whole preceding description of the way in which the divine wrath has been manifested against Jerusalem, it draws this conclusion: "Judah has lost its king and its princes, who have been carried away among the heathen: it has also lost the law and prophecy." "Law" and "vision" are mentioned as both media of divine revelation. the law is the summary of the rule of life given by God to His people: this exists no more for Judah, because, with the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple, the divinely appointed constitution of Israel was abolished and destroyed. Prophecy was the constant witness to the presence of God among His people; by this means the Lord sought to conduct Israel to the object of their election and calling, and to fit them for becoming a holy nation and a kingdom of priests. The perf. &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is not a preterite, but the expression of an accomplished fact. The prophets of the daughter of Zion no longer obtain any vision or revelation from Jahveh: the revelation of God by prophets has ceased for Zion. The words imply that there are still prophets, and merely affirm that they do not receive any revelation from God. This is not opposed to the fact that Jeremiah, some months after the destruction of Jerusalem, again received a revelation; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-4.htm">Jeremiah 42:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>. The meaning of the complaint is simply that Jahveh no longer owns His people, no longer gives them a token of His gracious presence, just as it is said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-9.htm">Psalm 74:9</a>, "There is no more any prophet." But it is not thereby declared that prophecy has altogether and for ever been silenced, but merely that, when Jerusalem was destroyed, Israel received no prophetic communication, - that God the Lord did not then send them a message to comfort and sustain them. The revelation which Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>) received regarding the determination of the people who sought to flee to Egypt, has no connection with this at all, for it does not contain a word as to the future destiny of Jerusalem. Hence it cannot be inferred, with Thenius, from the words now before us, that the present poem was composed before that revelation given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>.; nor yet, with Ngelsbach, that the writer had here before his mind the condition of the great mass of the people who had been carried away into exile. Neither, indeed, were the people in exile without prophetic communications; for, even so early as six years before the overthrow of Jerusalem, God had raised up to the exiles a prophet in the person of Ezekiel.</body></html>
