In that thought, terrible as it might at first seem, there was an element of hope. It was better to fall into the hands of God than into those of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-14.htm" title="And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.">2Samuel 24:14</a>). The suffering came as a chastisement for past transgressions, and might therefore be mitigated by repentance. The Destroyer was also the Healer, and would answer the prayers of those who called on Him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-22 Causes for lamentation are described. Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fear God, and walk humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That which he had devised - Or, what he purposed.

"Horn" has a twofold meaning - "strength" or "defence" (comp. ver. 3), and "honour" or "dignity" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). The figure is too natural to need explanation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The impotence of human comfort, and the mockery of enemies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>. The misery that has befallen the people is so fearful, that sorrow over it wears out one's life. "Mine eyes pine away because of tears," is the complaint of the prophet, not merely for himself personally, but in the name of all the godly ones. "Mine eyes pine" is the expression used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>. On &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a>. The expression, "my liver is poured out on the earth," occurs nowhere else, and is variously explained. That the liver is fons sanguinis, and thus the seat of the animal life (Rosenmller, Thenius), cannot be made out from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23</a>. This passage rather forms a proof that among the Hebrews, according to a view widely prevalent in ancient times, the liver was considered the seat of sensual desire and lust (cf. Delitzsch's Bib. Psychology, Clark's translation, p. 316). But this view is insufficient as an explanation of the passage now before us. Besides, there are no proofs to show that "liver" is used for "heart," or even for "gall," although <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a> is unwarrantably adduced in support of this position. A closely related expression, certainly, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-16.htm">Job 30:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>, where the soul is said to be poured out; but the liver is different from &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, the principle of the corporeal life. If the liver was called &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; because, according to Galen, de usu partium, vi. 17 (in Gesen. Thes. p. 655), omnium viscerum et densissimum et gravissimum est, then it may be regarded, instead of &#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, as the chief bodily organ through which not merely lust, but also pain, is felt; and the pouring out of the liver on the earth may thus mean that the inner man is dissolved in pain and sorrow, - perishes, as it were, through pain. For it is evident from the context, and universally admitted, that it is the effect of pain in consuming the bodily organs that is here meant to be expressed. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; is a genuine Jeremianic expression (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-11.htm">Jeremiah 8:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>, etc.), which again occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-47.htm">Lamentations 3:47-48</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>. In what follows, some harrowing details are given regarding the destruction of the daughter of Zion. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1506;&#1496;&#1507;, while (or because) children and sucklings were pining away on the streets of the city. This figure of heartrending misery is further carried out in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>, for the purpose of vividly setting forth the terrible distress. Gerlach is wrong in thinking that the writer brings forward such sad scenes as would be likely to present themselves in the period immediately after the destruction of the city. For, the fact that, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>, the eye of the mourner is directed to the present, is far from being a proof that <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a> also treat of the present; and the imperfect &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>, is not parallel in time with &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>, but designates the repetition of the action in past time. "The children say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine?" i.e., Give us bread and wine, or, Where can we eat and drink? Corn and must (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>, etc.) are mentioned as the usual means of nourishment of the Israelites. &#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1503;, "corn," is used poetically for bread (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>), - not pounded or roasted grain, which was used without further preparation (Thenius), and which is called &#1511;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-17.htm">1 Samuel 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>. The sucklings poured out their soul, i.e., breathed out their life, into the bosom of their mothers, i.e., hugging their mothers, although these could not give them nourishment; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4</a>.</body></html>
