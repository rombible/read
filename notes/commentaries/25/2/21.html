Multitudes perished by famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, and eaten, according to the threatening, De 28:53. Multitudes fell by the sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbours laughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, and adds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed over them. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for its ruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation are given; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought. Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for every malady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer our case to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fear God, and walk humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Omit "them" and "and," which weaken the intensity of the passage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Young men and old men, virgins and aged women; these promiscuously lay on the ground in the public streets, fainting and dying for want of food; or lay killed there by the sword of the enemy; the Chaldeans sparing neither age nor sex. The Targum interprets it of their sleeping on the ground, <p>"young men slept on the ground in the villages, and old men who used to lie on pillows of fine wool, and on beds of ivory;'' <p>but the former sense is confirmed by what follows: <p>my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; by the sword of the Chaldeans, when they entered the city: <p>thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger: thou hast killed,  <p>and not pitied; the Chaldeans were only instruments; it was the Lord's doing; it was according to his will; it was what he had purposed and decreed; what he had solemnly declared and threatened; and now in his providence brought about, for the sins of the Jews, by which he was provoked to anger; and so gave them up into the hands of their enemies, to slay them without mercy; and which is here owned; the church takes notice of the hand of God in all this. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Strangers and enemies have, for the misfortune of Jerusalem, only expressions of scorn and delight over her loss. "Those who pass by the way" are strangers who travel past Jerusalem. To clap the hands together is not here a gesture betokening anger and disinclination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a>), but of delight over the injury of others, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1511;, to hiss, is an expression of scorn; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>. The same is true as regards the shaking of the head; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">Psalm 22:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-25.htm">Psalm 109:25</a>, etc.: the expression for this, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>, is &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;. The exclamation, "Is this the city which they call 'perfect in beauty'?" is an expression of scornful astonishment. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1514; &#1497;&#1508;&#1497; is substantially the same as &#1502;&#1499;&#1500;&#1500; &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>, where the expression is applied to Zion; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a> the same is said of Tyre. That Jeremiah had <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a> in his mind is shown by the apposition, "a joy of the whole earth," which is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>.</body></html>
