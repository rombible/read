Yet God is not an enemy to his people, when he is angry with them and corrects them. And gates and bars stand in no stead when God withdraws his protection. It is just with God to cast down those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin; and to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths and ordinances, who have not duly valued nor observed them. What should they do with Bibles, who make no improvement of them? Those who misuse God's prophets, justly lose them. It becomes necessary, though painful, to turn the thoughts of the afflicted to the hand of God lifted up against them, and to their sins as the source of their miseries.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>sanctuary - The holy of holies; "the walls of her palaces" are those of the sacred buildings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. they &#8230; made a noise in &#8230; house of &#8230; Lord, as in &#8230; feast&#8212;The foe's shout of triumph in the captured temple bore a resemblance (but oh, how sad a contrast as to the occasion of it!) to the joyous thanksgivings we used to offer in the same place at our "solemn feasts" (compare La 2:22).<p>Cheth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/lamentations/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">altar</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">sanctuary</span> seemeth not to be meant strictly here the places or buildings so called, which are said to be the Lord’s, because he directed the making of them, and they were dedicated to his service, and used for no other use; but the stated worship and communion of the church of the Jews; as altar is taken, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1 Corinthians 10:18</a></span>.

The passages are parallel, though, whether the calamities referred to are the same in beth, cannot <span class="accented">a priori</span> be determined. The shouts of triumph of the foe are likened to the festal shouts of the temple worshippers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Description of the judgment. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>. The lamentation opens with signs for the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. The first member of the verse contains the general idea that the Lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, the Lord &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;, very suitably used instead of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;) has, in His wrath, enveloped Jerusalem with clouds. This thought is particularized in the two members that follow, and is referred to the overthrow of Jerusalem and the temple. &#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1489;, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; (which is &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. as a verb, and is probably a denominative from &#1506;&#1489;, a cloud), signifies to cover or surround with clouds. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493; does not mean "with His wrath" (Ewald, Thenius), but "in His wrath," as is shown by <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-21.htm">Lamentations 2:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-22.htm">Lamentations 2:22</a>. "The daughter of Zion" here means the city of Jerusalem, which in the second member is called "the glory (or ornament) of Israel," by which we are to understand neither res Judaeorum florentissimae in general (Rosenmller), nor the temple in special, as the "splendid house," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10</a> (Michaelis, Vaihinger). Jerusalem is called the glory or ornament of Israel, in the same way as Babylon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10</a> is called "the glory of the splendour of the Chaldeans" (Thenius, Gerlach). In the figurative expression, "He cast down from heaven to earth," we are not to think there is any reference to a thunderbolt which knocks down an object, such as a lofty tower that reaches to heaven (Thenius); "from heaven" implies that what is to be thrown down was in heaven, as has been already remarked by Raschi in his explanation, postquam sustulisset eos (Judaeos) usque ad coelum, eosdem dejecit in terram, where we have merely to substitute "Jerusalem," for eos, which is too vague. Gerlach has rightly remarked that the expression "cast down from heaven" is to be accounted for by the fact that, in the first member of the verse, Jerusalem is compared to a star, in the same way as Babylon is expressly called a tar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>; nay, what is more, Jerusalem is here compared to a star that has fallen from heaven; the reference to that passage thus becomes unmistakeable. Moreover, the casting down from heaven means something more than deprivation of the glory that had come on the city in consequence of God's dwelling in the midst of it (Gerlach); it signifies, besides, the destruction of the city, viz., that it would be laid in ashes. In all this, the Lord has not been thinking of, i.e., paid any regard to, His footstool, i.e., the ark of the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>), - not the temple (Ewald), although we cannot think of the ark without at the same thinking of the temple as the house in which it was kept. The ark, and not the temple, is named, because the temple became a habitation of the Lord, and a place where He revealed Himself, only through the ark of the covenant, with which the Lord had graciously connected His presence among His people. It is further implied, in the fact that God does not think of His footstool, that the ark itself was destroyed along with the temple and the city.</body></html>
