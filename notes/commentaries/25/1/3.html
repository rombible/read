The Hebrew admits, however, of the rendering “from affliction,” and so the words speak of the forcible deportation of the people from misery at home to a yet worse misery in Babylon as the land of their exile. Even there they found no “rest” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-65.htm" title="And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>) Their persecutors hunted them down to the “straits” from which no escape was possible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/lamentations/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-3.htm" title="Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwells among the heathen, she finds no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.">Lamentations 1:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, </span>&c. — Her miseries have received their finishing stroke in a total captivity among, and bondage to, heathen and infidels, because of the oppression exercised by her rulers and others, and the servitude to which they obliged their subjects and inferiors. This is the interpretation adopted by the Chaldee paraphrast, who represents the Jews as having been carried into captivity, in retaliation of their having oppressed the widows and the fatherless among them, and prolonged illegally the bondage of their brethren who had been sold for slaves. But, as the word <span class="greekheb">גלה</span>, here used, does not necessarily signify <span class="ital">to go into captivity, </span>but often to <span class="ital">remove, </span>or <span class="ital">go into exile, </span>whether voluntarily or by compulsion; Blaney thinks that “a voluntary migration of the Jews is here intended, many of whom, previous to the captivity, had left their country, and retired into Egypt and other parts, to avoid the oppressions and servitude that they had reason to apprehend from the Chaldeans, who had invaded, or were about to invade, their land. Either of these senses,” however, he observes, “is competent; and the interpretation according to them will be found to suit perfectly with the subsequent members of the period.” <span class="ital">She findeth no rest — </span>No satisfaction of mind, no settled place of abode, no remission of labour, terror, and suffering; but, deprived of all peace and comfort, is continually exposed to every insult and outrage, and to all manner of oppressions and vexations. <span class="ital">All her persecutors — </span>Or <span class="ital">pursuers, </span>rather; <span class="ital">overtook her between the straits — </span>That is, all her enemies have taken the opportunity of her being in a difficult and distressed condition, to oppress and injure her. The expression is metaphorical, taken from those who hunt their prey, which they are wont to drive into some strait and difficult passage, from whence it cannot escape.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The prophet sometimes speaks in his own person; at other times Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of the Jews. The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because of ... - i. e. the people, not of Jerusalem only, but of the whole land, "is gone into exile to escape from the affliction and laborious servitude," to which they are subject in their own land.<p>Persecutors ... between the straits - Rather, "pursuers ... in the midst of her straits."

Not only Jerusalem the metropolis of Judea was destroyed, but the whole country was ravaged, and the inhabitants of it carried captive into Babylon: <p>because of affliction, and because of great servitude; because of their sins in oppressing and afflicting their poor brethren, and retaining them in a state of bondage after their seven years' servitude, contrary to the law of God; for which they were threatened with captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-13.htm">Jeremiah 34:13</a>; so the Targum, <p>"the house of Judah went into captivity, because they afflicted the fatherless and the widows; and because of the multitude of service which they caused their brethren the children of Israel to serve, who were sold unto them; and they did not proclaim liberty to their servants and maidens, who were of the seed of Israel:'' <p>or, "through affliction, and through great servitude" (l); that is, through the affliction and servitude they suffered by the Chaldeans, into whose hands they fell; though some understand it of the Jews, who, to escape the affliction and servitude of the Chaldeans, went into a kind of voluntary captivity, fleeing to the countries of Moab, Ammon, and Edom, during the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11</a>; <p>she dwelleth among the Heathen; the uncircumcised and the unclean; and so was deprived of both her civil and religious liberties; having no opportunity of worshipping God, and enjoying him in his courts, as formerly; and which must be very uncomfortable living, especially to those who were truly gracious: <p>she findeth no rest. The Targum adds, <p>"because of the hard service to which they subjected her;'' <p>she found no natural rest, being carried from place to place; nor civil rest, being kept in hard bondage; nor spiritual rest, being deprived of the worship and ordinances of God; and being conscious of her sins, which had brought all this misery on her: <p>all her persecutors overtook her between the straits; having hunted her as men hunt wild beasts, and get them into some strait and difficult place, and then seize on them. The Targum interprets it, between the borders; or between the hedges, as Ben Melech; and so Jarchi, of the borders of a field and vineyard; and of a ditch on the one side and the other, that there is no room to escape; and who makes mention of a Midrash, that explains it not of place, but time, between the seventeenth day of Tammuz, and the ninth of Ab; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>. <p>(l) "per afflictionem"; "hic, non prae, sed per significat", Grotius; "vel prae afflictione, sub. a Chaldaeis perpessa"; so some in Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Judah is gone into captivity because <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her in the midst of distress.</span><p>(e) For her cruelty toward the poor and oppression of servants, Jer 34:11.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">is gone into captivity because of affliction</span>] The better rendering is, <span class="ital">is gone into</span> <span class="bld">exile</span> (so mg.) <span class="ital">because of affliction</span>, i.e. the long sufferings of the Jews at the hands of Egypt and Chaldaea had induced many of them to go voluntarily to dwell in other lands. That this frequently took place we gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm" title="Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;">Jeremiah 40:11</a>. This is better than the alternative rendering (<span class="ital">taken</span>) <span class="ital">out of</span> affliction (into Babylon), as this would be a lightening of the picture hardly in consonance with the purpose of the writer. If, however, this latter be the sense, the word “servitude” will be illustrated by the “hard service” inflicted on exiles in Babylon according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-3.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give you rest from your sorrow, and from your fear, and from the hard bondage wherein you were made to serve,">Isaiah 14:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">within the straits</span>] distresses, oppression.

An objection has been raised to this view that the number of fugitive Jews would not be large enough to warrant their being called "Judah." But we might almost as well object on a similar ground to the application of the term "Judah" to the Jews who were carried to Babylon. The truth may, perhaps, be that, after the fall of Jerusalem, the Jewish nation became split up into three parts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Jews who succeeded in escaping into Egypt or elsewhere; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those who were carried captive; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the mass of the common people, who remained on their native soil, Keil, however, retains the view of the Authorized Version, only substituting  "out of" for "because of." "Out of" the misery into which the Jews had been brought by the invasions of Necho and Nebuchadnezzar they passed into the new misery of captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Among the heathen;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among the nations. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Between the straits.</span> The phrase is peculiar, and reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>, "Out of the strait I called unto thee." "A strait," or narrow place, clearly means adversity, just as "a large place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>) means prosperity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/jeremiah/52.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The closing portion of this chapter, viz., the notice regarding the liberation of Jehoiachin from imprisonment, ad his elevation to royal honours by Evil-merodach after Nebuchadnezzar's death, substantially agrees with the account given of that even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27-30</a>. The difference of date, "on the twenty-fifth of the month" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm">Jeremiah 52:31</a>), and "on the twenty-seventh of the month" in 2 Kings, has arisen through the entrance of a clerical error into one text or the other. The few remaining variations of the two texts have no influence on the meaning.
