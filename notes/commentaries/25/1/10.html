The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness of her sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatest adversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also be suffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famine and distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, and entreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to make ourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lord for man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows, lamentations, sickness, and death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Her pleasant things - Chiefly, the sacred vessels of the temple <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>.<p>Sanctuary ... congregation - Even a Jew might not enter the innermost sanctuary, which was for the priests only; but now the tramp of pagan soldiery has been heard within its sacred precincts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. for&#8212;surely she hath seen, &c.<p>heathen &#8230; command &#8230; not enter &#8230; congregation&#8212;for instance, the Ammonites and Moabites (De 23:3; Ne 13:1, 2).

Jarchi (w) interprets the enemy of the Moabites and Ammonites, who seized upon the books of the law, in which are things more desirable than gold and silver, and burnt them; because there was a law in them that forbid them entering into the congregation of Israel; but the Targum better explains it of Nebuchadnezzar the wicked; for he and the Chaldean army are doubtless meant; who plundered and ransacked the temple of all its pleasant, precious, and valuable things: <p>for she hath seen that the Heathen entered into her sanctuary; not into the land of Israel only, the holy land; but into the temple, the sanctuary of the Lord; but called hers, because it was built for her use, that the congregation of Israel might worship the Lord in it; into this with her own eyes, though forced to it, and sore against her will, and to her great grief and trouble, she saw the Chaldeans enter, and ravage and spoil it: <p>whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation; these Jarchi interprets of the Moabites and Ammonites again; and so does the Targum here; paraphrasing them thus, <p>"whom thou didst command by the hand of Moses the prophet, concerning Ammon and Moab, that they were not worthy to enter into thy congregation;'' <p>and concerning whom there is an express law forbidding it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>; and it may be there were Moabites and Ammonites in the Chaldean army, assisting in the taking of Jerusalem; and who entered into the temple when it was taken. <p>(w) E Talmud.

"The ways of Zion" are neither the streets of Jerusalem (Rosenmller), which are called &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, nor the highways or main roads leading to Zion from different directions (Thenius, who erroneously assumes that the temple, which was situated on Moriah, together with its fore-courts, could only be reached through Zion), but the roads or highways leading to Jerusalem. These are "mourning," i.e., in plain language, desolate, deserted, because there are no longer any going up to Jerusalem to observe the feasts. For this same reason the gates of Zion (i.e., the city gates) are also in ruins, because there is no longer any one going out and in through them, and men no longer assemble there. The reason why the priests and the virgins are here conjoined as representatives of the inhabitants of Jerusalem is, that lamentation is made over the cessation of the religious feasts. The virgins are here considered as those who enlivened the national festivals by playing, singing, and dancing: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-13.htm">Jeremiah 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-21.htm">Judges 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>. &#1504;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514; (Niphal of &#1497;&#1490;&#1492;) is used here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-13.htm">Zephaniah 2:13</a>, of sorrow over the cessation of the festivals. Following the arbitrary rendering, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, of the lxx, Ewald would alter the word in the text into &#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514;, "carried captive." But there is no necessity for this: he does not observe that this rendering does not harmonize with the parallelism of the clauses, and that &#1504;&#1492;&#1490; means to drive away, but not to lead captive.<p>(Note: See, however, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-2.htm">1 Samuel 20:2</a>, with Keil's own rendering, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>, with Delitzsch's translation. - Tr.)<p>&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, "and she (Zion) herself" is in bitterness (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-13.htm">Ruth 1:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>), i.e., she feels bitter sorrow.
