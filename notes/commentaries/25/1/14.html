Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Let all our sorrows lead us to the cross of Christ, lead us to mark his example, and cheerfully to follow him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bound by his hand - As the plowman binds the yoke upon the neck of oxen, so God compels Judah to bear the punishment of her sins.<p>They are wreathed, and ... - Or, they are knotted together, "they come up" etc. Judah's sins are like the cords by which the pieces of the yoke are fastened together <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>; they are knotted and twined like a bunch upon the neck, and bind the yoke around it so securely that it is impossible for her to shake it off.<p>He hath made ... - Or, it hath made "my strength" to stumble.

Metaphor from husbandmen, who, after they have bound the yoke to the neck of oxen, hold the rein firmly twisted round the hand. Thus the translation will be, "in His hand." Or else, "the yoke of my transgressions" (that is, of punishment for my transgressions) is held so fast fixed on me "by" God, that there is no loosening of it; thus English Version, "by His hand."<p>wreathed&#8212;My sins are like the withes entwined about the neck to fasten the yoke to.<p>into their hands, from whom&#8212;into the hands of those, from whom, &c.

My punishments are twisted as cords, to make them more strong; I have a complication of judgments upon me, sword, famine, pestilence, captivity; they are not only prepared for my neck, but they are already put upon it.

That is, the punishment of her sins was laid upon her by the Lord himself; his hand was in it; it came from him; the Chaldeans were only instruments; and a heavy yoke this was. So the Targum renders it, <p>"the yoke of my rebellions is made heavy by his hand:'' <p>they are wreathed, and come upon my neck; or, "twisted together" (b); as lines to make a cord; or as several cords to make a rope; or as branches of trees or withes are implicated and entwined; and so the Targum, <p>"they are twisted together as the branches of a vine.'' <p>It denotes the complication of judgments upon the Jewish nation for their sins, with which they were holden as with cords; and which were like ropes about their necks, very heavy and distressing to them, and from which they could not deliver themselves. Mr. Broughton thinks the apostle has reference to this passage; and explains it by the sin that easily besets, or cunningly wraps about, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>; <p>he hath made my strength to fall; by the weight of punishment laid upon her, which she could not stand up under, but sunk and fell: this may be understood of her strong and mighty men; her men of valour and courage, who yet stumbled and fell: <p>the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up; meaning the Chaldeans; nor were the Jews at last delivered from them by their own strength, but by the means of Cyrus the Persian conquering Babylon. <p>(b) "involutae", Vatablus; "perplexae", Pagninus, Montanus, Calvin; "contortae", Piscator, Grotius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are knit together, <i>and</i> come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into <i>their</i> hands, <i>from whom</i> I am not able to rise.</span><p>(p) My heavy sins are continually before his eyes as he that ties a thing to his hand for a reminder.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">is bound</span>] The manifold sins of the people are likened to a complication of cords, attaching a yoke to the neck of a beast of burden, and keeping it secure in its place.

The Heb. verb, however, occurs here only, and the reading may be corrupt. The LXX (and so Vulg.), by the slightest possible change in reading the Heb. verb (involving only the transference of a diacritical mark), render “watch has been kept over mine iniquities,” obtaining the latter part of their rendering by taking the word pointed in MT. to mean <span class="ital">yoke</span> (‘<span class="ital">ol</span>) as though it were the preposition <span class="ital">upon</span> (‘<span class="ital">al</span>). We must then, for the sake of metrical division, take “by his hand” in connexion with “they are knit together,” and, as this leaves the next line (in the MT.) too short, Budde there inserts “a yoke” before “upon,” rendering, “They have come up as a yoke upon my neck; they have made my strength to fail.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is bound...are wreathed.</span> The transgressions of Jerusalem are likened to a heavy yoke.

Regarding these forms, cf. Ewald, 84, a. &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; (prop. what one should flee from) signifies in particular the uncleanness of the menstrual discharge in women, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-5.htm">Leviticus 12:5</a>, etc.; then the uncleanness of a woman in this condition, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>, etc.; here it is transferred to Jerusalem, personified as such an unclean woman, and therefore shunned. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, the Hiphil of &#1494;&#1500;&#1500; (as to the form, cf. Ewald, 114, c), occurs only in this passage, and signifies to esteem lightly, the opposite of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, to esteem, value highly; hence &#1494;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, "despised," <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-19.htm">Jeremiah 15:19</a>. Those who formerly esteemed her - her friends, and those who honoured her, i.e., her allies - now despise her, because they have seen her nakedness. The nakedness of Jerusalem means her sins and vices that have now come to the light. She herself also, through the judgment that has befallen her, has come to see the infamy of her deeds, sighs over them, and turns away for shame, i.e., withdraws from the people so that they may no longer look on her in her shame.</body></html>
