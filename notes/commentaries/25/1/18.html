Observe, reader, whatever the troubles are which God is pleased to inflict upon us, we must own that in them he is righteous: we neither know him nor ourselves, if we do not acknowledge this.

The Egyptians and her other allies are intended, who made court to her in her prosperity, and promised her assistance, but in the day of her adversity and necessity were alienated from her, and cast her off.

Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Let all our sorrows lead us to the cross of Christ, lead us to mark his example, and cheerfully to follow him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>People - peoples, pagan nations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

Or, "righteous is he the Lord" (g); in all these dispensations of his providence, how afflictive and severe soever they may seem to be; however the enemies of the church and people of God might transgress just bounds, and act the cruel and unrighteous part; yet good men will always own that God is righteous in all his ways, and that there is no unrighteousness in him; though they sometimes know not how to reconcile his providences to his promises, and especially to his declared love and affection to them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; the reason, clearing God of all injustice, follows: <p>for I have rebelled against his commandment; or, "his mouth" (h): the word of his mouth, which he delivered by word of mouth at Mount Sinai, or by his prophets since; and therefore was righteously dealt with, and justly chastised. The Targum makes these to be the words of Josiah before his death, owning he had done wrong in going out against Pharaohnecho, contrary to the word of the Lord; and the next clause to be the lamentation of Jeremiah upon his death: though they are manifestly the words of Jerusalem or Zion, whom the prophet personates, saying, <p>hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow; directing herself to all compassionate persons, to hearken and attend to her mournful complaint, and to consider her sorrow, the nature and cause of it, and look upon her with an eye of pity in her sorrowful circumstances: <p>my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity; in Babylon; being taken and carried thither by the Chaldeans; had it been only her ancient men and women, persons worn out with age, that could have been of little use, and at most but of a short continuance, the affliction had not been so great; but her virgins and young men, the flower of the nation, and by whom it might have been supported and increased; for these to be carried away into a strange land must be matter of grief and sorrow. <p>(g)   "justus ipse est Jehovah", Cocceius.

The first words, &#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, are difficult to explain. The lxx have &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;; but the reading ought certainly to be &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769; &#x3c0;. &#x3c5;&#788;.. The Vulgate is, o vos omnes; the Chaldee, adjuro vos omnes. They all seem to have taken &#1500;&#1493;&#1488; as an exclamation. Hence Le Clerc and others would read &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; but in this case one would require to supply a verb: thus, Le Clerc renders utinam adspiciatis, or, "O that my cry might reach you!" But these insertions are very suspicious. The same holds true of the explanation offered by J. D. Michaelis in his edition of Lowth on Hebrew Poetry, Lect. xxii.: non vobis, transeuntes in via, haec acclamo (viz., the closing words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a>): this is decidedly opposed by the mere fact that passers-by certainly could not regard a call addressed to Jahveh as applying to them. Without supplying something or other, the words, as they stand, remain incomprehensible. Ngelsbach would connect them with what follows: "[Look] not to yourselves...but look and see...." But the antithesis, "Look not upon yourselves, but look on me (or on my sorrow)," has no proper meaning. If we compare the kindred thought presented in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-18.htm">Lamentations 1:18</a>, "Hear, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow," then &#1500;&#1493;&#1488;  seems to express an idea corresponding to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1488;. But we obtain this result only if we take the words as a question, as if &#1500;&#1493;&#1488;  equals  &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, though not in the sense of an asseveration (which would be unsuitable here, for which reason also &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; is not used); the question is shown to be such merely by the tone, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-22.htm">Exodus 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a>. Thus, we might render the sense with Gerlach: Does not (my sighing - or, more generally, my misery - come) to you? The Syriac, Lowth, Ewald, Thenius, and Vaihinger have taken the words as a question; Ewald, following <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-4.htm">Proverbs 8:4</a>, would supply &#1488;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;. But such an insertion gives a rendering which is both harsh and unjustifiable, although it lies at the foundation of Luther's "I say unto you." Hence we prefer Gerlach's explanation, and accordingly give the free rendering, "Do ye not observe, sc. what has befallen me, - or, my misery?" The words are, in any case, intended to prepare the way for, and thereby render more impressive, the summons addressed to all those passing by to look on and consider her sorrow. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; is passive (Poal): "which is done to me." Since &#1492;&#1493;&#1490;&#1492; has no object, the second &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; does not permit of being taken as parallel with the first, though the Chaldee, Rosenmller, Kalkschmidt, and others have so regarded it, and translate: "with which Jahveh hath afflicted me." With Ewald, Thenius, Gerlach, etc., we must refer it to &#1500;&#1497;: "me whom Jahveh hath afflicted." The expression, "on the day of the burning of His anger," is pretty often found in Jeremiah; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-26.htm">Jeremiah 4:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-37.htm">Jeremiah 25:37</a>, etc.</body></html>
