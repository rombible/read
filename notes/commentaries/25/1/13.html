Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings were harder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must be great sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin, and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may be learned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned from the sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every one of us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?

Which the Targum interprets of her fortified cities, towns, or castles; as Jerusalem, more especially the temple, and the palaces of the king and nobles in it; which, though burnt by the fire of the Chaldeans, yet, this being according to the determination and by the direction of the Lord, is said to be sent from above, from heaven; so that they seemed to be as it were struck with lightning from heaven; unless it should be thought rather to be understood of the fire of divine wrath, of which the people of the Jews had a quick sense, and was like a burning fever in them: <p>and it prevails against them; or "it" (z); that is, the fire prevails against or rules over everyone of the bones, to the consumption of them: or rather, "he rules over it" (a); that is, God rules over the fire; directs it, and disposes of it, according to his sovereign will and pleasure, to the destruction of the strength of the Jewish nation: <p>he hath spread a net for my feet; in which she was entangled, so that she could not flee from the fire, and escape it, if she would. The allusion is to the taking of birds and wild beasts in nets; if God had not spread a net for the Jews, the Chaldeans could never have taken them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>; <p>he hath turned me back; her feet being taken in the net, she could not go forward, but was obliged to turn back, or continue in the net, not being able to extricate her feet: or, "turned me upon my back"; as the Arabic version; laid me prostrate, and so an easy prey to the enemy; or, as the Targum, <p>"he hath caused me to turn the back to mine enemies:'' <p>he hath made me desolate and faint all the day; the cities being without inhabitants; the land uncultivated; the state in a sickly and languishing condition; and which continued so to the end of the seventy years' captivity. <p>(z) "et desaeviit in ea", Munster, Tigurine version; "et contrivit ipsum"; so some in Vatablus.

"Jerusalem" is not the totality of those who are carried away (Thenius), but the city personified as the daughter of Zion (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-6.htm">Lamentations 1:6</a>). "The days of her affliction," etc., is not the direct object of "remembers," as Pareau and Kalkschmidt assume, with the lxx; the object is "all her pleasant things." If "the days of her affliction" were also intended to be the object, "all her pleasant things" would be preceded by the copula w, which Pareau indeed supplies, but arbitrarily. Moreover, the combination of the days of misery with the glory of bygone days is inappropriate, because Jerusalem feels her present misery directly, and does not need first to call them to remembrance. "The days of her affliction," etc., is the accusative of duration. Living through the times of her adversity, Jerusalem thinks of former happy times, and this remembrance increases her sorrow. &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; occurs only here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> : in meaning it is connected with &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, vagari, and signifies roaming, - not voluntary, but compulsory, - rejection, persecution; while the adjective &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, found in Isaiah, is, as regards its form, taken from &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;, which is cognate with &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;. &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a>, Kethib) is perhaps used in a more general sense than &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a> (Qeri), an signifies what is costly, splendid, viz., gracious gifts, both of a temporal and spiritual kind, which Israel formerly possessed, while &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; signifies costly treasures. "The days of old" are the times of Moses and Joshua, of David and Solomon. In the words, "when her people fell," etc., the days of misery are more exactly specified. The suffix in &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; refers to Jerusalem. &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are the foes into whose power Jerusalem fell helplessly, not specially the escorts of those who were carried away (Thenius). They made a mockery of her &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. This word is &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. It is not identical in meaning with  ,&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;sabbata (Vulgate, Luther, etc.), though connected with it; nor does it signify deletiones, destructions (Gesenius), but cessationes. This last rendering, however, is not to be taken according to the explanation of Rosenm&#1516;ller: quod cessasset omnis ille decor, qui nominatus este ante, principatus et prosper rerum status; but rather as L. Cappellus in his nott. crit. expresses it: quod nunc terra ejus deserta jacet nec colitur et quasi cessat et feriatur, though he does not quite exhaust the meaning. As Gerlach rightly remarks, the expression is "evidently used with reference to the threatenings given in the law, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34-35</a>, that the land would observe its Sabbaths, - that it will keep them during the whole period of the desolation, when Israel is in the land of his enemies." We must not, however, restrict the reference merely to the uncultivated state of the fields, but extend it so that it shall be applied to cessation from all kinds of employment, even those connected with the worship of God, which were necessary for the hallowing of the Sabbath. The mockery of enemies does not apply to the Jewish celebration of the Sabbath (to which Grotius refers the words), but to the cessation of the public worship of the Lord, inasmuch as the heathen, by destroying Jerusalem and the temple, fancied they had not only put an end to the worship of God of the Jews, but also conquered the God of Israel as a helpless national deity, and made a mock of Israel's faith in Jahveh as the only true God.</body></html>
