Let him pray; and let him in prayer pour out his complaint to God. The people of God do so here; they complain not of evils feared, but of evils felt. If penitent and patient under what we suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that He who punishes, will return in mercy to us. They acknowledge, Woe unto us that we have sinned! All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we may hope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kind providence. But the sins of a man's whole life will be punished with vengeance at last, unless he obtains an interest in Him who bare our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our necks ... - i. e. we were pursued so actively that our enemies seemed to be leaning over our necks ready to seize us.<p>We labor - We were wearied, "there was no rest for us:" being chased incessantly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Literally, "On our necks we are persecuted"; that is, Men tread on our necks (Ps 66:12; Isa 51:23; compare Jos 10:24). The extremest oppression. The foe not merely galled the Jews face, back, and sides, but their neck. A just retribution, as they had been stiff in neck against the yoke of God (2Ch 30:8, Margin; Ne 9:29; Isa 48:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/lamentations/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As the generality of prisoners of war are made slaves, and put to hard and incessant labour, so in probability the most of the Jews were at first at least. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/lamentations/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Our necks are under persecution,.... A yoke of hard servitude and bondage was put upon their necks, as Jarchi interprets it; which they were forced to submit unto: or, "upon our necks we are pursued" (s); or, "suffer persecution": which Aben Ezra explains thus, in connection with the <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-4.htm">Lamentations 5:4</a>; if we carry water or wood upon our necks, the enemy pursues us; that is, to take it away from us. The Targum relates a fable here, that when Nebuchadnezzar saw the ungodly rulers of the children of Israel, who went empty, he ordered to sow up the books of the law, and make bags or wallets of them, and fill them with the stones on the banks of the Euphrates, and loaded them on their necks: <p>we labour, and have no rest; night nor day, nor even on sabbath days; obliged to work continually till they were weary; and, when they were, were not allowed time to rest themselves, like their forefathers in Egypt. <p>(s)   "super colla nostra persecutionem passi sumus", Pagninus, Montanus, Calvin; "vel patimur", Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">Our pursuers are upon our necks</span>] The expression is a strange one, as applied to those remaining in the land. Since in the original the consonants of “upon” are identical with those for “yoke,” we may either substitute the latter for the former (so Ball), rendering <span class="ital">the yoke of our neck</span>, and altering “our pursuers” to <span class="ital">they made heavy</span>, or, with this latter change consider that both words (“yoke” and “upon”) were originally in the Heb. text, <span class="ital">The yoke on our neck they have made heavy</span>.

Persecution is here compared to a yoke. But this rendering and explanation hardly  suit the phrase, which rather means, "<span class="accented">We</span> are pursued close upon our necks." The harassing conduct of the Babylonian conquerors is compared to the pursuit of a foe fast gaining upon a fugitive. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>However, it is not yet all over with Israel. Let the enemy triumph; the guilt of the daughter of Zion will come to an end, and then the guilt of the daughter of Edom will be punished. With this "Messianic hope," as Ewald rightly characterizes the contents of these verses, the lamentation resolves itself into joyous faith and hope regarding the future of Israel. There is no external sign to mark the transition from the depths of lamentation over the hopeless condition of Judah, to new and hopeful confidence, just as in the Psalms there is frequently a sudden change from the deepest lamentation to joyful confidence of final victory. But these transitions have their origin in the firm conviction that Israel has most assuredly been chosen as the nation with whom the Lord has made His covenant, which He cannot break. This truth has already been clearly and distinctly expressed in the threatenings and promises of the law, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, and is reiterated by all the prophets. The Lord will assuredly visit His ever-rebellious people with the heaviest punishments, until they come to acknowledge their sin and repent of their apostasy; but He will afterwards again take pity on the penitent remnant, gather them from among the heathen, and fulfil all His promises to them. The words "exult and rejoice" are ironical, and signify: "Rejoice as much as you please; you will not, for all that, escape the punishment for your sins." "The daughter of Edom," i.e., the people of Edom, is named as the representative of the enemies of God's people, on account of their implacable hatred against Israel; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>. From the designation, "dwelling in the land of Uz," it does not follow that the Edomite had at that time spread themselves widely over their original territory; for the land of Uz, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>, lay on the confines of Idumea. As to the form &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-17.htm">Jeremiah 10:17</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, "towards thee also (sc., as now to Judah) shall the cup pass." On this figure, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>. &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, to make oneself naked, or to become naked in consequence of drunkenness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22</a>), is a figurative expression indicative of the disgrace that will befall Edom; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498;, "Thy guilt is ended." The perfect is prophetic. The guilt is ended when it is atoned for; the punishment for it has reached its end, or grace begins. That this will take place in the Messianic times (as was pointed out long ago in the Chaldee paraphrase, et liberaberis per manum Messiae), is not indeed implied in the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, but it is a necessary product of the Messianic hope of Israel; cf, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-20.htm">Jeremiah 50:20</a>. To this it cannot be objected (with Gerlach), that it is inadmissible to transfer into the Messianic time also the punishment of Edom threatened in the second member: for, according to the prophetic mode of viewing things, the judgment on the heathen world falls, as a matter of course, in the Messianic age; and to refer the words to the chastisement of the Edomites by Nebuchadnezzar is against the context of both verses. "To reveal (discover) sins" means to punish them; for God uncovers the sins in order to punish them, quemadmodum Deus peccata tegere dicitur, cum eorum paenam remittit (Rosenmller); cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/85-3.htm">Psalm 85:3</a>, etc. </body></html>
