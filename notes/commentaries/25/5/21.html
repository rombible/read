O Lord . . .</span>—The answer to the problem was found in man’s submission and in prayer. He could not turn himself, and so re-establish the old filial relation. He could ask God to turn him, and he felt that the prayer would not be asked in vain.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:17-22 The people of God express deep concern for the ruins of the temple, more than for any other of their calamities. But whatever changes there are on earth, God is still the same, and remains for ever wise and holy, just and good; with Him there is no variableness nor shadow of turning. They earnestly pray to God for mercy and grace; Turn us to thee, O Lord. God never leaves any till they first leave him; if he turns them to him in a way of duty, no doubt he will quickly return to them in a way of mercy. If God by his grace renew our hearts, he will by his favour renew our days. Troubles may cause our hearts to be faint, and our eyes to be dim, but the way to the mercy-seat of our reconciled God is open. Let us, in all our trials, put our whole trust and confidence in his mercy; let us confess our sins, and pour out our hearts before him. Let us watch against repinings and despondency; for we surely know, that it shall be well in the end with all that trust in, fear, love, and serve the Lord. Are not the Lord's judgments in the earth the same as in Jeremiah's days? Let Zion then be remembered by us in our prayers, and her welfare be sought above every earthly joy. Spare, Lord, spare thy people, and give not thine heritage to reproach, for the heathen to rule over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remainest - Or, reignest.

(Ps 80:3; Jer 31:18). "Restore us to favor with Thee, and so we shall be restored to our old position" [Grotius]. Jeremiah is not speaking of spiritual conversion, but of that outward turning whereby God receives men into His fatherly favor, manifested in bestowing prosperity [Calvin]. Still, as Israel is a type of the Church, temporal goods typify spiritual blessings; and so the sinner may use this prayer for God to convert him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/lamentations/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See the like expression <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-18.htm" title="I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the LORD my God.">Jeremiah 31:18</a></span>.

This prayer expresses the sense they had of their backslidings from God, and distance from him; of their inability to turn themselves to the Lord, or convert themselves; and of their need of divine grace, and of the efficacy of that to effect it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>; for this is to be understood not only of returning them to their own land, and to the external worship of God in it; but of turning them to the Lord by true and perfect repentance, as the Targum; of the conversion of their hearts and the reformation of their lives: <p>renew our days as of old; for good, as the Targum adds. The request is, that their good days might be renewed; that they might enjoy the same peace and prosperity, and all good things in their own land, as they had done in days and years past: first they pray for repentance; then restoration. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{l}</span> Turn thou us to thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</span><p>(l) By which is declared that it is not in man's power to turn to God, but is only his work to convert us, and thus God works in us before we can turn to him, Jer 31:18.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">Turn thou us</span> …] suggestive of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-18.htm" title="I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the LORD my God.">Jeremiah 31:18</a>, but see note there.

"Turn thou us" means "Bring us into a state of reconciliation with thee" The next petition, <span class="cmt_word">Renew our days as of old,</span> means, "Restore the old happy mode of life, each man with his own vine and his own fig tree, undisturbed by the fear of invasion, and rejoicing in the sense of the favour of Jehovah." The first petition has the priority because only on repentance and recovered purity of heart and life can Jerusalem rise from her ashes. Isaiah had said this long ago (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26, 27</a>), and the elegiac poet repeats it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-18.htm">Jeremiah 31:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Under the pressure of such circumstances, all public meetings and amusements have ceased. "The elders cease from the fate." The gate was the place of assembly for the people, not merely for deliberating upon public affairs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>), but also "for social entertainment (since there were no refreshment-rooms, coffeehouses, and public baths, such as are now to be found in the East), or even for quiet enjoyment in looking at the motley multitude of passers-by; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-18.htm">1 Samuel 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-18.htm">1 Samuel 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>" (Winer's Bibl. R.W.B. s.v. Thor). That the gate is here to be regarded as a place of entertainment and amusement, is shown by the parallel member, "young men cease from their instrumental music;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>. On <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-15.htm">Lamentations 5:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-13.htm">Jeremiah 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-12.htm">Psalm 30:12</a>. Lastly, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-16.htm">Lamentations 5:16</a>, the writer sums up the whole of the misery in the complaint, "The crown of our head is fallen! woe unto us, for we have sinned," i.e., we suffer the punishment for our sins. "The fallen crown can only be a figurative expression for the honourable position of the people in its entirety, but which is now lost." Such is the view which Ewald rightly takes; on the other hand, the interpretation of Thenius, that "the 'crown of our head' is nothing else than Zion, together with its palaces, placed on Jerusalem, as it were on the head [of the country], and adorning it," deserves mention simply as a curious specimen of exegetical fancy. Ngelsbach has gone too far in restricting the figurative expression to the crown of Jerusalem, which consists in her being mistress among the nations, a princess among the regions of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>), the perfection of beauty, and the joy of the whole earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>); for "our crown" is not equivalent to Jerusalem, or a crown on the head of Jerusalem.</body></html>
