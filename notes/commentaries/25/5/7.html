If penitent and patient under what we suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that He who punishes, will return in mercy to us. They acknowledge, Woe unto us that we have sinned! All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we may hope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kind providence. But the sins of a man's whole life will be punished with vengeance at last, unless he obtains an interest in Him who bare our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And are not; and we ... - Or, they are not; "we have borne their iniquities."

It is the prophet who here speaketh, and in the name of the godly Jews, who would not excuse themselves as if they suffered merely for their forefathers’ sins. But the prophet confesseth and bewaileth that God had punished their iniquities and the iniquities of their forefathers together; and it was better with their forefathers who had sinned, and were dead and gone, than with them, upon whom the punishment of their iniquity did abide, and was like so to do a long time. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/lamentations/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Our fathers have sinned, and are not,....

This view of national troubles is very clearly endorsed by one important class of passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). The objection to it is forcibly expressed by Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>), "God [it is said] layeth up his iniquity for his children: [but] let him requite it to himself, that he may feel it!" Hence Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-1.htm">Ezekiel 18:1</a>, etc.) insist on the truth that every man is punished for his own sins. Of course the two views of punishment are reconcilable. The Jews were not only punished, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11, 12</a>, for their fathers' sins, but for their own still more flagrant offences. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Supplication and statement regarding the distress. The quest made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1</a> refers to the oppression depicted in what follows. The words, "Remember, O Lord, what hath happened (i.e., befallen) us," are more fully explained in the second member, "Look and behold our disgrace." It is quite arbitrary in Thenius to refer the first member to the past, the second to the present, described in what follows, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-12.htm">Lamentations 5:12-16</a>. The Qeri &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; is an unnecessary alteration, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-11.htm">Lamentations 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-63.htm">Lamentations 3:63</a>. - With <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-2.htm">Lamentations 5:2</a> begins the description of the disgrace that has befallen them. This consists, first of all, in the fact that their inheritance has become the possession of strangers. Rosenm&#1516;ller rightly explains &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; to mean, terra quae tuo nobis dono quandam est concessa. &#1504;&#1495;&#1508;&#1498; is used of the transference of the property to others, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>. Many expositors would refer &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; to the houses in Jerusalem which the Chaldeans had not destroyed, on the ground that it is stated, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-13.htm">Jeremiah 52:13</a>, that the Chaldeans destroyed none but large houses. There is no foundation, however, for this restriction; moreover, it is opposed by the parallel &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. Just as by &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; we are to understand, not merely the possession of Jerusalem, but of the whole country, so also &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; are the dwelling-houses of the country in towns and villages; in this case, the question whether any houses still remained standing in Jerusalem does not demand consideration at all. Ngelsbach is wrong in his remark that &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; respectively mean immovable and portable property, for houses are certainly not moveable property.</body></html>
