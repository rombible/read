(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-2.htm" title="Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover your locks, make bore the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.">Isaiah 47:2</a>.)

Let him pray; and let him in prayer pour out his complaint to God. The people of God do so here; they complain not of evils feared, but of evils felt. If penitent and patient under what we suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that He who punishes, will return in mercy to us. They acknowledge, Woe unto us that we have sinned! All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly. Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we may hope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kind providence. But the sins of a man's whole life will be punished with vengeance at last, unless he obtains an interest in Him who bare our sins in his own body on the tree.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They took the young men to grind - Or, "The young men" have borne the mill, a menial and laborious task usually performed by slaves (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a>).<p>The children fell under the wood - Or, lads have stumbled under burdens of wood.

In the mill, which was laborious service; and which persons were sometimes put to, by way of punishment; and was the punishment of servants; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>. Some render it, "the young men bore the grist" (x); carried the corn, the meal ground, from place to place. The Targum is, <p>"the young men carried the millstones;'' <p>and so Jarchi, they put millstones upon their shoulders, and burdens so as to weary them. Ben Melech, from their Rabbins, relates, that there were no millstones in Babylon; wherefore the Chaldeans put them upon the young men of Israel, to carry them thither. The Vulgate Latin version is, <p>"they abused the young men in an unchaste manner;'' <p>suggesting something obscene intended by grinding; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a>; but the context will not admit of such a sense: <p>and the children fell under the wood; such loads of wood were laid upon them, that they could not bear them, but fell under them. Aben Ezra understands it of moving the wood of the mill, of turning the wooden handle of it; or the wooden post, the rider or runner, by which the upper millstone was turned: this their strength was not equal to, and so failed. The Targum interprets it of a wooden gibbet, or gallows; some wooden engine seems to be had in view, used as a punishment, which was put upon their necks, something like a pillory; which they were not able to stand up under, but fell. <p>(x)   "juvenes farinam portaverunt"; so some in Gataker; "juvenes molam tulerunt", Cocceius; "juvenes ad molendum portant", Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> the wood.</span><p>(g) Their slavery was so great, that they were not able to abide it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>.

Dr. Thomson "cannot recall an instance in which men were grinding at the mill" ('The Land and the Book,' edit. 1881, p. 108), and both <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a> presuppose that it was women's work.

There is a great truth contained in the words, "Our fathers have sinned; they are no more; we bear their iniquities (or guilt)." For the fall of the kingdom had not been brought about by the guilt of that generation merely, and of none before; it was due also to the sins of their fathers before them, in previous generations. The same truth is likewise expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a> it is stated that God did not cease from His great wrath because of the sins of Manasseh. But this truth would be perverted into error, if we were to understand the words as intimating that the speakers had considered themselves innocent. This false view, however, they themselves opposed with the confession in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-16.htm">Lamentations 5:16</a>, "for we have sinned;" thereby they point out their own sins as the cause of their misfortune. If we compare this confession with the verse now before us, this can only mean the following: "The misfortune we suffer has not been incurred by ourselves alone, but we are compelled to atone for the sins of our fathers also." In the same way, too, Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11</a>) threatens the infliction of a penal judgment, not merely "because your fathers have forsaken me (the Lord)," but he also adds, "and ye do still worse than your fathers." God does not punish the sins of the fathers in innocent children, but in children who continue the sins of the fathers; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a>, and the explanation given of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>. The design with which the suffering for the sins of the fathers is brought forward so prominently, and with such feeling, is merely to excite the divine compassion for those who are thus chastised.</body></html>
