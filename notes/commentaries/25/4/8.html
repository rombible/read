Sin tarnishes the beauty of the most exalted powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried in the fire, which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; its outward appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never be changed. The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee in rebellion, yet turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy name.

The description given of this misery is divided into two strophes: for, first (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1-6</a>), the sad lot of the several classes of the population is set forth; then (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7-11</a>) a conclusion is drawn therefrom regarding the greatness of their sin.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1-6</a><p>The first strophe. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a>. The lamentation begins with a figurative account of the destruction of all that is precious and glorious in Israel: this is next established by the bringing forth of instances.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1-2</a><p><a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a> contain, not a complaint regarding the desolation of the sanctuary and of Zion, as Maurer, Kalkschmidt, and Thenius, with the lxx, assume, but, as is unmistakeably declared in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a>, a lamentation over the fearful change that has taken place in the fate of the citizens of Zion. What is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a> regarding the gold and the precious stones must be understood figuratively; and in the case of the "gold that has become dim," we can as little think of the blackening of the gilding in the temple fabric when it was burnt, as think of bricks (Thenius) when "the holy stones" are spoken of. The &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (inhabitants of Zion), <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a>, are likened to gold and sacred stones; here Thenius would arbitrarily change &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (houses, palaces). This change not merely has no critical support, but is objectionable on the simple ground that there is not a single word to be found elsewhere, through all the chapter, concerning the destruction of the temple and the palaces; it is merely the fate of the men, not of the buildings, that is bewailed. "How is gold bedimmed!" &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; is the Hophal of &#1506;&#1502;&#1501;, to be dark, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a>, and to darken, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a>. The second clause, "how is fine gold changed!" expresses the same thing. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, according to the Chaldaizing usage, means to change (oneself), <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>. The growing dim and the changing refer to the colour, the loss of brilliancy; for gold does not alter in substance. B. C. Michaelis and Rosenmller are too specific when they explain that the gold represents populus Judaicus (or the potior populi Hebraei pars), qui (quae) quondam auri instar in sanctuario Dei fulgebat, and when they see in &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; an allusion to the stones in the breast-plate of the high priest. Gold is generally an emblem of very worthy persons, and "holy stones" are precious stones, intended for a sacred purpose. Both expressions collectively form a figurative description of the people of Israel, as called to be a holy nation and a kingdom of priests. Analogous is the designation of the children of Israel as &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a> (Gerlach). &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;, to be poured out (at all the corners of the streets), is a figurative expression, signifying disgraceful treatment, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a> follows the application of the figure to the sons (i.e., the citizens) of Zion, not merely the chief nobles of Judah (Ewald), or the princes, nor children in the narrowest sense of the word (Gerlach); for in what follows mention is made not only of children (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4</a>), but also of those who are grown up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>), and princes are not mentioned till <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>. As being members of the chosen people, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem have been held "dear," and "weighed out with gold," i.e., esteemed as of equal value with gold (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a>); but now, when Jerusalem is destroyed, they have become regarded as earthenware pots, i.e., treated as if they were utterly worthless, as "a work of the hands of the potter," whereas Israel was a work of the hands of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>. &#1505;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1505;&#1500;&#1492;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a> to weigh; Pual, be weighed out, as an equivalent.</body></html>
