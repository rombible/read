The Chaldeans, from their forts and batteries, as they could see, they watched the people as they came out of their houses, and walked about the streets, and shot their arrows at them; so that they were obliged to keep within doors, and not stir out, which they could not do without great danger: <p>our end is near, for our days are fulfilled; for our end is come; either the end of their lives, the days, months, and years appointed for them being fulfilled; or the end of their commonwealth, the end of their civil and church state, at least as they thought; the time appointed for their destruction was not only near at hand, but was actually come; it was all over with them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">They hunt our steps</span>] This expresses the danger which existed in the “streets” (lit. broad places, and therefore exposed) from the towers which were gradually advanced nearer to the walls by the besiegers. Eastern <span class="ital">streets</span> are too narrow to expose their occupants to the weapons of a besieging force.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They hunt our steps,</span> etc. Realistic attempts to explain this line have not been wanting, but seem unsuccessful. The Chaldeans were either within the city or without. If within, they would not need literally to "hunt the steps" of the Jews; if without, they had not war engines adequate to shooting the inhabitants at some distance. Probably the expressions are metaphorical; they are similar to those used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>, immediately after which we meet with such a purely poetical phrase as, "They have cut off my life in the pit [Authorized Version, 'dungeon'], and cast a stone upon me" (see note on Lamentations 3:52-56). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This judgment of wrath is a consequence of the sins of the prophets and priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12-16</a>), as well as of their vain trust on the help of man (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-17.htm">Lamentations 4:17-20</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12</a>. The capture of Jerusalem by enemies (an event which none in all the world thought possible) has been brought on through the sins of the prophets and priests. The words, "the kings of the earth...did not believe that an enemy would come in at the gates of Jerusalem," are well explained by C. B. Michaelis, thus: reputando fortitudinem urbis, quae munitissima erat, tum defensorem ejus Jehovam, qui ab hostibus, ad internecionem caesis, urbem aliquoties, mirifice liberaverat, e.g., 2 Reg. 19:34. The words certainly form a somewhat overdrawn expression of deep subjective conviction; but they cannot properly be called a hyperbole, because the remark of Ngelsbach, that Jerusalem had been taken more than once before Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>.), seems incorrect. For the occasions upon which Jerusalem was taken by Shishak and by Joash king of Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14.htm">1 Kings 14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a>) belong to those earlier times when Jerusalem was far from being so strongly fortified as it afterwards became, in the times of Uzziah, Jotham, and Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>, on the other hand, there is nothing said of Jerusalem being taken; and the capture by Pharaoh-Necho does not call for consideration, in so far as it forms the beginning of the catastrophe, whose commencement was thought impossible. Ewald wrongly connects <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12</a> into one sentence, thus: "that an enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem because of the sins of her prophets," etc. The meaning of these verses is thereby not merely weakened, but also misrepresented; and there is ascribed to the kings and inhabitants of the world an opinion regarding the internal evils of Jerusalem, which they neither pronounced nor could have pronounced.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12-14</a><p><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-12.htm">Lamentations 4:12</a> contains an exclamation over the incredible event that has happened, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a> assigns the cause of it: the mediating and combining thought, "this incredible thing has happened," suggests itself. It has taken place on account of the sins of her prophets and priests, who have shed the blood of righteous men in Jerusalem. A historic proof of this is furnished in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a>., where priests and prophets indicted Jeremiah on a capital charge, because he had announced that Jerusalem and the temple would suffer the fate of Shiloh; from this, Ngelsbach rightly concludes that, in any case, the burden of the guilt of the martyr-blood that was shed falls on the priests and prophets. Besides this, cf. the denunciations of the conduct of the priests and prophets in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-10.htm">Jeremiah 27:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-15.htm">Lamentations 4:15</a>, there is described the fate of these priests and prophets, but in such a way that Jeremiah has, throughout, mainly the priests before his mind. We may then, without further hesitation, think of the priests as the subject of &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, inasmuch as they are mentioned last. Kalkschmidt wrongly combines <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>, thus: "because of the sins of the prophets...they wander about," etc.; in this way, the Israelites would be the subject to &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a> the calamitas ex sacerdotum prophetarumque sceleribus profecta would be described. This, however, is contradicted, not merely by the undeniable retrospection of the expression, "they have polluted themselves with blood" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>), to the shedding of blood mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a>, but also by the whole contents of <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>, especially the impossibility of touching their clothes, which does not well apply to the people of Israel (Judah), but only to the priests defiled with blood. Utterly erroneous is the opinion of Pareau, Ewald, and Thenius, that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14-16</a> there is "presented a fragment from the history of the last siege of Jerusalem," - a rupture among the besieged, headed by the most eminent of the priests and prophets, who, filled with frenzy and passion against their fellow-citizens, because they would not believe in the speedy return of the exiles, became furious, and caused their opponents to be murdered. Regarding this, there is neither anything historical known, nor is there any trace of it to be discovered in these verses. The words, "prophets and priests hesitated (or wavered) like blind men on the streets, soiled with blood, so that none could touch their clothes," merely state that these men, smitten of God in consequence of their blood-guiltiness, wandered up and down in the streets of the city, going about like blind men. This description has been imitated from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:28</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>, where the people, and especially their leaders, are threatened, as a punishment, with blind and helpless staggering; but it is not to be referred to the time of the last siege of Jerusalem. &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean caedium perpetrandarum insatiabili cupiditate occaecati (Rosenmller), nor "as if intoxicated with blood that has been shed" (Ngelsbach), but as if struck with blindness by God, so that they could no longer walk with firm and steady step. "They are defiled with blood" is a reminiscence from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>. As to the form &#1504;&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;, compounded of the Niphal and Pual, cf. Ewald, 132, b, and Delitzsch on Isaiah, l.c. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, without one being able, i.e., so that one could not. As to the construction of &#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500; with a finite verb following, instead of the infinitive with &#1500;, cf. Ewald, 285, c, c, and Gesenius, 142, 3, b.</body></html>
