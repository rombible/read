Sin tarnishes the beauty of the most exalted powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried in the fire, which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; its outward appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never be changed. The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee in rebellion, yet turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy name.

Such as were naturally, and agreeably to their sex, pitiful and compassionate; merciful to the poor, as the Targum; and especially tenderhearted to their own offspring; yet, by reason of the soreness of the famine, became so cruel and hardhearted, as to take their own children, and slay them with their own hands, cut them to pieces, put them into a pot of water, and make a fire and boil them, and then eat them, as follows: <p>they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people: at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem. This strange and unnatural action was foretold by Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56</a>; and though we have no particular instance of it on record, as done at the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, yet no doubt there was, as may be concluded from the words: and at the siege of it by the Romans, when many things here spoken of had a fuller accomplishment, we have a remarkable instance of it, which Josephus (a) relates; an illustrious woman, named Mary, pressed with the famine, slew her own son, a sucking child, boiled him, and ate part of him, and laid up the rest; which was found by the seditious party that broke into her house, which struck them with the utmost horror; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>. <p>(a) De Bello Jud. l. 6. c. 3. sect. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a> it is not children, but adults, that are spoken of. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is variously rendered, since &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; occurs nowhere else in construction with &#1500;. Against the assumption that &#1500; is the Aramaic sign of the object, there stands the fact that &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; is not found thus construed with &#1500;, either in the Lamentations or elsewhere, though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2</a> &#1500; is so used. Gerlach, accordingly, would take &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; adverbially, as meaning "after their heart's desire," prop. for pleasures (as to this meaning, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-17.htm">Proverbs 29:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-32.htm">1 Samuel 15:32</a>), in contrast with &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;, to eat for satisfaction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-19.htm">Leviticus 25:19</a>, etc. But "for pleasure" is not an appropriate antithesis to satisfaction. Hence we prefer, with Thenius, to take &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1500; in the sense of nibbling round something, in which there is contained the notion of selection in the eating; we also take &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, to mean dainties. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, to be made desolate, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>, of the destruction of happiness in life; with &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, to sit in a troubled or gloomy state of mind on the streets. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, those who (as children) were carried on purple (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; rof &#1514;&#1468;&#1493; towla`at &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, cochineal, crimson), embrace (i.e., cling to) dung-heaps, seek them as places or rest.</body></html>
