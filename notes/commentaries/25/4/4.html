Sin tarnishes the beauty of the most exalted powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried in the fire, which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; its outward appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never be changed. The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee in rebellion, yet turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy name. Come to us, bless us with awakening, converting, renewing, confirming grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sea monsters - Rather, jackals.<p>Their young ones - "Their" whelps.

B. Michaelis, Rosenmller, etc.), - since the asyndetic &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; does not accord with such an interpretation, - but a relieving of oneself by means of deeply-drawn sighs, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-20.htm">Job 32:20</a>; hence "sighing," as Luther has already rendered it, following the Vulgate: ne avertas aurem tuum a singultu meo (Thenius, Gerlach, etc.). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-57.htm">Lamentations 3:57</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-58.htm">Lamentations 3:58</a>, the writer still more fully expresses his confidence that the Lord will accept him. "Thou art near on the day when I call on Thee" is a sentence found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>, and uttered as the experience of all believers. "Thou sayest, Fear not," i.e., Thou assurest me of Thine assistance; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>, etc. "Thou dost conduct the causes (Ger. Streitsachen) of my soul" (&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;), i.e., not merely "my lawsuits," but causas quae vitam et salutem meam concernunt (C. B. Michaelis). This is shown by the parallel member, "Thou redeemest my life," sc. from the destruction which threatens it; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-53.htm">Lamentations 3:53</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-4.htm">Psalm 103:4</a>. With this is connected the request in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-59.htm">Lamentations 3:59</a>, "Thou dost certainly see my oppression" (&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, to bend, oppress), the oppression which I suffer; "judge my cause," i.e., help me in my cause, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>. The suppliant bases this request, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-60.htm">Lamentations 3:60-62</a>, on the recollection that God, as the Omniscient One, knows the plans and intentions of his opponents. "Thou seest all their plans for revenge." &#1504;&#1511;&#1502;&#1492; is not here the outcome of revenge, but the thought of revenge cherished in the heart; it does not, however, mean desire of revenge, or revengeful disposition, but simply the thinking and meditating on revenge, which certainly has the spirit of revenge for its basis, but is not identical with this. Their thoughts are the plans of vengeance.  ,&#1500;&#1497;dat. incomm., "to my hurt;" the reading &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; of some codices is simply a correction after <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-61.htm">Lamentations 3:61</a>. This revenge they express in reproaches and invectives. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;, "lips," for utterances of the lips; and &#1511;&#1502;&#1497; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-40.htm">Psalm 18:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>  equals  &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>, etc. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497; &#1511;&#1502;&#1497; corresponds to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, and &#1495;&#1490;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; to &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-61.htm">Lamentations 3:61</a>; and the whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-62.htm">Lamentations 3:62</a> still depends on "Thou hearest," without any need for supplying &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, as Rosenmller does. Thenius and Ngelsbach would combine <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-62.htm">Lamentations 3:62</a> with 63, and make the former dependent on &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;; but this is unsuitable, nor do they consider that utterances or words are not seen (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;), but heard (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;). With this proposed combination there falls to the ground the further remark of Thenius, that "by lips, devising, sitting, rising up, are meant the conversation and consultation of the enemies one with another." Sitting and rising up have nothing in common with speaking about any subject, but merely form a circumlocution for action generally: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-19.htm">Deuteronomy 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-28.htm">Isaiah 37:28</a>. The form &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; occurs nowhere else: Ewald considers it a form that has been lengthened for the purpose of designating a mocking song - "Sing-song." This supposition has at least more to recommend it than the ingenious but worthless idea of Bttcher, that &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is contracted from &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, "what a stringed instrument am I to them;" but it also is improbable. &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is the subject of the &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, as words formed with &#1502; often express merely the subject of the idea contained in a noun or verb; cf. Ewald, 160, b, 3. After this statement of the hostile treatment which the speaker has to suffer, there follows the renewed and further extended request that God may reward the foes according to their deeds. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, "Thou shalt return," is a confident expression of the request that God would do this; hence the optative &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-65.htm">Lamentations 3:65</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-64.htm">Lamentations 3:64</a> is condensed the substance of what is contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-4.htm">Psalm 28:4</a>. &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;, covering (veil) of the heart, - an expression analogous to the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>, - is not obduration, or hardening, but blinding of the heart, which casts into destruction; but it can scarcely signify "madness" (Delitzsch, Bibl. Psychology, Clark's translation), since the Arabic majannat, insania, furor, has probably received this meaning from jinn, genius, daemon; cf. Gesenius, Thes. s. v., and Rosenmller, ad h. l. "Thy curse to them!" is not to be viewed as dependent on "give," but to be explained in accordance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/3-9.htm">Psalm 3:9</a>, "Thy blessing [be] upon Thy people!" - thus, "May Thy curse be their portion!" The curse of God is followed by destruction. "Destroy them from under Jahveh's heaven!" i.e., not merely ut non sint amplius sub caelis (C. B. Michaelis), because &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is not considered in this latter rendering. The heaven of Jahveh is the whole world, over which Jahveh's authority extends; the meaning therefore is, "Exterminate them wholly from the sphere of Thy dominion in the world," or, Thy kingdom. </body></html>
