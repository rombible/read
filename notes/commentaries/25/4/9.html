Sin tarnishes the beauty of the most exalted powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried in the fire, which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; its outward appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never be changed. The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee in rebellion, yet turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy name.

Not that they are better with respect to their state after death, but with respect to their manner of dying. They that were slain by the sword of the Chaldeans, as many were, either upon the walls, or in sallies out against the enemy, these felt less pain, and had less terror of mind in dying, than those did who perished by famine; they died a lingering death, as it were by inches, and were in continual pain of body and uneasiness of mind: <p>for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field: that is, those that died by famine gradually wasted or "flowed" away, their fluid parts by degrees went off; and though they were not run through with the sword, they were stabbed by famine, and were so distressed in body and mind as if a sword had pierced them; not having the fruits of the field, the corn and the wine, to support nature, and keep them alive. Jarchi's note is, <p>"they that were slain with hunger were inflated at the smell of the fruits of the field, when the enemies were roasting their flesh upon the grass without the wall; the smell entered into those that swelled by famine, and their bellies burst, and their excrements flowed out; and this is the death worse than that of being slain with the sword.'' <p>And to this agrees the Targum, <p>"more happy are they that are slain with the sword than they that are slain with famine; for they that are slain with the sword flowed when their bellies were burst, by that which they ate of the fruits of the field; and those that were inflated with famine, their bellies burst through "want" of food.'' <p>Most interpreters refer this clause to those that died of famine: but Gussetius (z) interprets it of those that were killed with the sword; and renders and paraphrases the words thus, "for they being stabbed, sent out"; by the open wounds, "a flux, which arose from the fruits of the field"; their food and nourishment being yet in their belly and veins, and so did not pine away through penury and famine; and their misery was short and light, in comparison of others: and so Abendana. <p>(z) Comment.

The starvation to death of the children (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4</a>) is mentioned first; and the frightful misery that has befallen Jerusalem is vividly set forth, by a comparison of the way in which wild animals act towards their young with the behaviour of the mothers of Jerusalem towards their children. Even jackals (&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>) give their breasts to their young ones to suck. &#1495;&#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; , extrahunt mammam  equals  they present their breast. As Junius has remarked, the expression is taken a mulieribus lactantibus, quae laxata veste mammam lactanti praebent; hence also we are not, for the sake of this expression, to understand &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; as meaning cetus (Bochart and Ngelsbach), regarding which animal Bochart remarks (Hieroz. iii. p. 777, ed. Rosenmller), ceti papillas non esse&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, quippe in mammis receptae tanquam in vaginis conduntur. Rosenm@fcller has already rejected this meaning as minus apta for the present passage. From the combination of jackals and ostriches as inhabiting desert places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>), we have no hesitation in fixing on "jackals" as the meaning here. "The daughter of my people" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>) here means the inhabitants of Zion or Jerusalem. &#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;, "has become cruel." The Kethib &#1499;&#1497; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (Qeri) may possibly have arisen from a purely accidental separation of the letters of the word in a MS, a reading which was afterwards painfully retained by the scribes. But in many codices noted by Kennicott and De Rossi, as well as in several old editions, the word is found correctly joined, without any marginal note. &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; means ostriches, usually &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; ("daughter of crying," or according to Gesenius, in his Thesaurus, and Ewald, following the Syriac, "the daughter of gluttony"), the female ostrich. The comparison with these animals is to be understood in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-16.htm">Job 39:16</a> : "she (the female ostrich) treats her young ones harshly, as if they were not her own." This popular belief is founded on the fact that the animal lays her eggs in the ground, - after having done no more than slightly scratching up the soil, - and partly also, when the nest is full, on the surface of the ground; she then leaves them to be hatched, in course of time, by the heat of the sun: the eggs may thus be easily broken, see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14-16</a>.</body></html>
