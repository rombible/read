There is no reason, however, for abandoning the rendering of the Authorised version. The reference to the Nazarites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/2-11.htm" title="And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O you children of Israel? said the LORD.">Amos 2:11-12</a> shows that they were prominent as a body during the history of the monarchy, and the drift of Jeremiah’s mind, as seen in his admiration of the Rechabites (Jeremiah 35), shows that he was likely to think of them with reverence. The temperance, purity, cleanliness of such a body seem to have made them conspicuous among their fellows for an almost angelic beauty. (Comp. the interesting parallel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-15.htm" title="And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.">Daniel 1:15</a>.)

Such who separated themselves by a vow to the Lord, and abstained from drinking wine and strong drink, and by a moderate diet, and often washing themselves, as well as taking great care of their hair, appeared very neat and comely, like snow, without any spot or blemish. Some think such as were separated from others in dignity, very honourable persons, the sons of nobles, are meant, since the word has the signification of a "crown", and interpret it, her princes; Jarchi makes mention of this sense, and rejects it; but it is received by many: and the meaning is, that her young noblemen, who were well fed, and neatly dressed, looked as pure and as beautiful as the driven snow: <p>they were whiter than milk; this intends the same thing, expressed by another metaphor: <p>they were more ruddy in body than rubies; or rather "than precious stones"; and particularly "than pearls", which Bochart (q) proves at large are designed by the word used, which are white, and not red; and the word should be rendered, "clearer" or "whiter than pearls", as it is by Lyra and others (r); and the word in the Arabic language signifies white and clear (s), as pearls are; and so the phrase is expressive of the beauty and comeliness of these persons: and Ludolphus (t) says, that in the Ethiopic language it signifies "beautiful"; and he translates the whole, "they were more beautiful than pearls"; denoting the clearness of their skins, and the goodness of their complexion: <p>their polishing was of sapphire; or "their cutting, sapphire" (u); they were as beautiful as if they had been cut out of sapphire, and polished; which is a very precious stone, and looks very beautiful; so smooth were their skins. The Targum is, <p>"their face or countenance is as sapphire.'' <p>Braunius (w) thinks the word used signifies the veins full of blood, which variously intersect the flesh like sapphirine rivers; and that the sense of the words is, <p>"their bodies were white like snow and milk, yea, shining like pearls (or red in the cheeks, lips, &amp;c. like coral (x)); veins full of blood running between like sapphire, of a most agreeable sky colour; which is, a true description of a most fair and beautiful body.'' <p>See Sol 5:14.

The description given of this misery is divided into two strophes: for, first (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1-6</a>), the sad lot of the several classes of the population is set forth; then (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7-11</a>) a conclusion is drawn therefrom regarding the greatness of their sin.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1-6</a><p>The first strophe. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a>. The lamentation begins with a figurative account of the destruction of all that is precious and glorious in Israel: this is next established by the bringing forth of instances.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1-2</a><p><a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a> contain, not a complaint regarding the desolation of the sanctuary and of Zion, as Maurer, Kalkschmidt, and Thenius, with the lxx, assume, but, as is unmistakeably declared in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a>, a lamentation over the fearful change that has taken place in the fate of the citizens of Zion. What is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a> regarding the gold and the precious stones must be understood figuratively; and in the case of the "gold that has become dim," we can as little think of the blackening of the gilding in the temple fabric when it was burnt, as think of bricks (Thenius) when "the holy stones" are spoken of. The &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (inhabitants of Zion), <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a>, are likened to gold and sacred stones; here Thenius would arbitrarily change &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (houses, palaces). This change not merely has no critical support, but is objectionable on the simple ground that there is not a single word to be found elsewhere, through all the chapter, concerning the destruction of the temple and the palaces; it is merely the fate of the men, not of the buildings, that is bewailed. "How is gold bedimmed!" &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; is the Hophal of &#1506;&#1502;&#1501;, to be dark, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a>, and to darken, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8</a>. The second clause, "how is fine gold changed!" expresses the same thing. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, according to the Chaldaizing usage, means to change (oneself), <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>. The growing dim and the changing refer to the colour, the loss of brilliancy; for gold does not alter in substance. B. C. Michaelis and Rosenmller are too specific when they explain that the gold represents populus Judaicus (or the potior populi Hebraei pars), qui (quae) quondam auri instar in sanctuario Dei fulgebat, and when they see in &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; an allusion to the stones in the breast-plate of the high priest. Gold is generally an emblem of very worthy persons, and "holy stones" are precious stones, intended for a sacred purpose. Both expressions collectively form a figurative description of the people of Israel, as called to be a holy nation and a kingdom of priests. Analogous is the designation of the children of Israel as &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a> (Gerlach). &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;, to be poured out (at all the corners of the streets), is a figurative expression, signifying disgraceful treatment, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm">Lamentations 4:2</a> follows the application of the figure to the sons (i.e., the citizens) of Zion, not merely the chief nobles of Judah (Ewald), or the princes, nor children in the narrowest sense of the word (Gerlach); for in what follows mention is made not only of children (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4</a>), but also of those who are grown up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>), and princes are not mentioned till <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>. As being members of the chosen people, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem have been held "dear," and "weighed out with gold," i.e., esteemed as of equal value with gold (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a>); but now, when Jerusalem is destroyed, they have become regarded as earthenware pots, i.e., treated as if they were utterly worthless, as "a work of the hands of the potter," whereas Israel was a work of the hands of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>. &#1505;&#1500;&#1488;  equals  &#1505;&#1500;&#1492;, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm">Job 28:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a> to weigh; Pual, be weighed out, as an equivalent.</body></html>
