For five centuries, however, the prophet’s words held good, and there was no thorough “dispersion” of the Jews till after the Roman conquest.<p><span class= "bld">He will discover thy sins.</span>—To cover sins is to forgive them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm" title="Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.">Psalm 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm" title="I acknowledge my sin to you, and my iniquity have I not hid.

Not the fulness of punishment deserved, but of what God has determined to inflict. An end shall be put to Edom's triumphs. All the troubles of the church and of the believer will soon be accomplished. And the doom of their enemies approaches. The Lord will bring their sins to light, and they shall lie down in eternal sorrow. Edom here represents all the enemies of the church. And the corruption, and sin of Israel, which the prophet has proved to be universal, justifies the judgments of the Lord. It shows the need of that grace in Christ Jesus, which the sin and corruption of all mankind make so necessary.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished - literally, Thy iniquity is ended. This is the result of Judah having borne her punishment. And as it is not just to punish twice for the same thing, therefore Jeremiah adds, "He will not send thee again into captivity;" not meaning that under all circumstances Judah would have immunity from exile; - for that would depend upon her future conduct: but that her present guilt being expiated, she would have nothing to fear on its account.<p>He will discover thy sins - See the margin. As Edom rejoices when the Church is chastised, so is the day of the Church's triumph that also on which the wicked meet with retribution. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

The full accomplishment of this prophecy must therefore refer to the Jews' final restoration.<p>discover&#8212;By the severity of His punishments on thee, God shall let men see how great was thy sin (Jer 49:10). God "covers" sin when He forgives it (Ps 32:1, 5). He "discovers," or "reveals," it, when He punishes it (Job 20:27). Jer 49:10 shows that Margin is wrong, "carry captive" (this rendering is as in Na 2:7; compare "discovered," Margin).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/lamentations/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> O Judea, thy punishment is past, but the punishment of Edom is yet to come. The Jews were to abide many years in captivity, but they were now suffering their last punishment from the Chaldeans, they were only for some years to continue in that state of captives. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He will no more carry thee into captivity; </span> after thy term of captivity shall be expired, thou shalt not for thy old sins suffer any more punishment. Not that their present captivity should be all their punishment in case they went on in sinful courses, as they did in rejecting Christ, and causing him to be crucified; for those new wickednesses after many years they were destroyed by the Romans; but the prophet hints that there should at present, or for their past sins, no more wrath be poured out upon them, nor would God ever detain them in this captivity. But for the Edomites, their punishment was yet wholly to come, God was yet beginning to punish them, and would do it, discovering their sins.

In part in the seventy years' captivity in Babylon, and more fully in their present captivity; for, as has been observed, there are some things in the preceding account, which had a further accomplishment in the destruction of Jerusalem, and the distress of the Jews by the Romans. The Targum is, <p>"and after thine iniquity is fulfilled, O congregation of Zion, and thou shalt be delivered by the hands of the Messiah, and of Elias the high priest;'' <p>he will no more carry thee away into captivity; he, the enemy; or the Lord, as the Targum: that is, thou shall no more be carried captive: this seems to confirm the above observation, that this chapter is a prophecy of what would be, as well as a narrative of what had been; and includes the destruction both of the first and second temple, and of the Jews both by the Chaldeans and Romans; for it is certain, that, after their deliverance from the captivity of Babylon, they have been carried captive, and are now in captivity; <p>he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; punish the Edomites for their sins, as is elsewhere threatened, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; which was fulfilled by Nebuchadnezzar as an instrument; and may have some respect to the destruction of the Romans, when the Jews shall be converted, and return to their own land. The Targum, in the king of Spain's Bible, is, <p>"and at that time I will visit thine iniquity, O wicked Rome, which art built in Italy, and full of multitudes of the children of Edom; and the Persians shall come and oppress thee, and make thee desolate;'' <p>and so the copy used by Munster: <p>he will discover thy sins; by the punishment of them; as, when God pardons sins, he is said to cover them; so, when he punishes for them, he discovers them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-10.htm">Jeremiah 49:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The punishment of thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will disclose thy sins.</span><p>(o) He comforts the Church because after seventy years their sorrows will have an end while the wicked would be tormented for ever.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished</span>] (better than mg. <span class="ital">Thine iniquity hath an end</span>) the prophetic perfect.
