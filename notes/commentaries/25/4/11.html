Sin tarnishes the beauty of the most exalted powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried in the fire, which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; its outward appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never be changed. The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee in rebellion, yet turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we may fear thy name.

Against the assumption that &#1500; is the Aramaic sign of the object, there stands the fact that &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; is not found thus construed with &#1500;, either in the Lamentations or elsewhere, though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2</a> &#1500; is so used. Gerlach, accordingly, would take &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; adverbially, as meaning "after their heart's desire," prop. for pleasures (as to this meaning, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-17.htm">Proverbs 29:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-32.htm">1 Samuel 15:32</a>), in contrast with &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;, to eat for satisfaction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-19.htm">Leviticus 25:19</a>, etc. But "for pleasure" is not an appropriate antithesis to satisfaction. Hence we prefer, with Thenius, to take &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1500; in the sense of nibbling round something, in which there is contained the notion of selection in the eating; we also take &#1502;&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, to mean dainties. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, to be made desolate, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>, of the destruction of happiness in life; with &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, to sit in a troubled or gloomy state of mind on the streets. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, those who (as children) were carried on purple (&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; rof &#1514;&#1468;&#1493; towla`at &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, cochineal, crimson), embrace (i.e., cling to) dung-heaps, seek them as places or rest.</body></html>
