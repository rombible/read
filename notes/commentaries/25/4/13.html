The priests and false prophets were then the ringleaders in persecution, as in Christ’s time the chief priests and scribes were the men that incensed the people against him, who otherwise would have persisted in their hosannas. This was the sin which the Lord would not pardon, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-4.htm" title="And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.">2 Kings 24:4</a>,) and which, above all others, brought utter destruction upon that city. Not that the people were innocent; no, while <span class="ital">the prophets prophesied falsely, </span>and the priests abused the power which their own office and the doctrine of these prophets gave them, the people <span class="ital">loved to have it so, </span>and it was, partly at least, to please many of them that the prophets and priests acted as they did. But the blame is chiefly laid upon them who should have taught the people better, should have reproved and admonished them, and told them what would be the end of such conduct: of the hands, therefore, of those watchmen who did not give them warning was their blood required. Indeed, the ecclesiastical men were the chief cause of both the first and last destruction of Jerusalem. And so they are of the destruction of most other places that come to ruin through their neglect of their duty, or their encouraging others in their wicked courses; which shows us both how great a blessing to a people a godly, conscientious ministry is, and how great an evil a ministry is which is otherwise.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-20 Nothing ripens a people more for ruin, nor fills the measure faster, than the sins of priests and prophets.

So though they were the corrupt magistrates that had shed the innocent blood, yet the priests and prophets became guilty of it, either encouraging the magistrates to it, or soothing them up in their bloody courses, or by burning the children that were burnt in the valley of Hinnom. The ecclesiastical men were a great cause of the first and last destruction of Jerusalem, and so they are of most other places that come to ruin, through their neglect of their duty, or encouraging others in their wicked courses; which both showeth us how great a blessing to a people a godly, conscientious ministry is, and how great a plague and curse a ministry is which is otherwise.

Aben Ezra interprets this of the prophets of Baal, and the priests of the high places; but though false prophets and wicked priests are meant, yet such as were among the Jews, made choice of and approved of by them: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>; not that the people were faultless, but these were the principals, who by their examples led on and encouraged the common people in sin: <p>that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her; not the blood of innocent children, sacrificed to them by Moloch; but of good men in general, whom they persecuted and slew; and of the true prophets of the Lord in particular, whose blood they shed; and was the sin that brought on the destruction of their city by the Romans, as well as of that by the Chaldeans; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the sins of her prophets, <i>and</i> the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> her,</span><p>(g) He means that these things are come to pass therefore, contrary to all men's expectations.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">the sins of her prophets</span>, and <span class="ital">the iniquities of her priests</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-31.htm" title="The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end thereof?">Jeremiah 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm" title="For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm" title="Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.">Jeremiah 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-11.htm" title="For both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 23:11</a> f.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the sins of her prophets,</span> etc. Instead of connecting this verse by a comma with the following, we should rather view it as a unit in itself, and understand at the beginning, "All this hath happened" The sins of the prophets and priests are mentioned together by Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11</a>), as well as by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>). But we are nowhere else told that the spiritual leaders of the people, in these closing years of the Jewish state, were guilty of shedding innocent blood, unless this is to be inferred from the incident related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a>, etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second strophe. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>.

Thenius would refer "pure (or bright) as snow and milk" to the white clothing, "because the Orientals have not milk-white faces." But the second member irrefragably shows that the reference is to bodily form; and for the very reason adduced by Thenius, a comparatively whiter skin than is commonly met with is esteemed more beautiful. So also does Sol 5:10, "My friend is white and red," show the high esteem in which beauty was held (Gerlach). &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, to be reddish. &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, "bone," for the body (pars pro toto). &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, not (white) pearls, but (red) corals. "The white and the red are to be understood as mixed, and shading into one another, as our popular poetry speaks of cheeks which 'like milk and purple shine' " (Delitzsch on <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>, Clark's translation). "Sapphire their form" (&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, prop. cut, taille, of the shape of the body). The point of the comparison is not the colour, but the luminosity, of this precious stone. Once on a time the princes glittered so; but (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>) now their form is dark as blackness, i.e., every trace of beauty and splendour has vanished. Through hunger and want their appearance is so disfigured, that they are no longer recognised in the streets (&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, in contrast with "at home," in their own neighbourhood). "The skin sticks to the bones," so emaciated are they; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-4.htm">Psalm 102:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a>. &#1510;&#1508;&#1491;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., to adhere firmly.
