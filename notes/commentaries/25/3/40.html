Let us search what our ways have been, and try whether they have been right and good or not. Let us examine our tempers, words, and works, and consider what they have been, whether agreeable or contrary to the holy will of God. Let us <span class="ital">try our ways, </span>that by them we may try ourselves: for we are to judge of our state and character, not by our faint wishes, good intentions, transient resolutions, or even warm affections, but by our steps; and not by one particular step, but by our ways, our whole conduct; the ends we aim at, the rules we go by, and the agreeableness or contrariety of the temper of our minds, and the tenor of our lives to those ends and those rules. When we are in affliction it is peculiarly seasonable to consider our ways, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-5.htm" title="Now therefore thus said the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.">Haggai 1:5</a>,) that what is amiss may be repented of, and amended for the future, and so we may answer the intention of the affliction. We are apt, in times of public calamity, to reflect upon other people’s ways, and lay blame upon them, whereas our business is to <span class="ital">search and try our </span>own <span class="ital">ways: </span>we have work enough to do at home; we must each of us say, What have I done? what have I contributed to the public distress? That we may each of us mend one, then we shall all be mended. <span class="ital">And let us turn again to the Lord — </span>Namely, by a sincere conversion, even to him who is turned against us, and from whom we have turned; to him let us turn by repentance, reformation, and faith, as to our owner and ruler. This particular must accompany the former, and be the fruit of it; therefore we must search and try our ways, that we may turn from the evil of them to God; this was the method David took, who says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm" title="I thought on my ways, and turned my feet to your testimonies.">Psalm 119:59</a>, <span class="ital">I thought on my ways, and turned my feet into thy testimonies. Let us lift up our heart, </span>&c. — Let us apply ourselves unto God by prayer, without which we shall attempt in vain to take the preceding advice. Without supernatural light from him we shall search and try our ways to little purpose: we shall still remain unacquainted with ourselves, and shall pass a false judgment on our character and conduct; and without his renewing grace we shall not be turned to him effectually. Now for these blessings we must make application to him in fervent prayer, lifting up <span class="ital">our hearts with our hands, </span>and pouring out our souls with our words, in confident expectation of receiving what we ask.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:37-41 While there is life there is hope; and instead of complaining that things are bad, we should encourage ourselves with the hope they will be better. We are sinful men, and what we complain of, is far less than our sins deserve. We should complain to God, and not of him. We are apt, in times of calamity, to reflect on other people's ways, and blame them; but our duty is to search and try our own ways, that we may turn from evil to God. Our hearts must go with our prayers.

let us search into the love of God, which, though it cannot be fully searched out, it will be found to be from everlasting to everlasting; and that all afflictions spring from it; and that it continues notwithstanding them: let us search into the covenant of grace, in which provision is made for afflictions in case of disobedience, and for supports under them: let us search the Scriptures, which are written for our comfort; and it is much if we do not find some in the instances, examples, and experiences of other saints therein recorded: let us search after a greater degree of the knowledge of Christ, and of his grace; so shall we be more conformable to his sufferings and death, and patient under our troubles: let us search into our own hearts, and examine ourselves, whether we have true repentance for sin, true faith in Christ; and whether he is in us, or not; and we have a part in him, which will make us easy in every state: let us search into the present dispensation, in order to find out the cause of it, which is sin; and the end of it, which God has in it for our good: let us search "our ways", and "try them", by the word of God, the standard of faith and practice; and see what agreement there is between them: let us try our thoughts, words, and actions, by the law of God, which is holy, spiritual, just, and good; and we shall see how abundantly short they come of it: and let us try "our ways", and compare them with the ways of God, which he has prescribed in his word; and we shall find that the one are holy, the other unholy; the one plain, the other crooked; the one dark, the other light; the one pleasant, and peace is in them, the other not; the one lead to life, the other to death;

&#1500;&#1488; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, the infinitives with their objects depend on &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;. If there were any foundation for the assertion of Bttcher in his Aehrenlese, that &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; never occurs in construction with &#1500;, we could take the infinitives with &#1500; as the objects of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, in the sense, "As to the crushing of all the prisoners," etc. But the assertion is devoid of truth, and disproved by <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;. In the three infinitival clauses three modes of unjust dealing are set forth. The treading down to the earth of all prisoners under his (the treader's) feet, refers to cruel treatment of the Jews by the Chaldeans at the taking of Jerusalem and Judah, and generally to deeds of violence perpetrated by victors in war. This explains &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, which Kalkschmidt and Thenius incorrectly render "all captives of the land (country)." Those intended are prisoners generally, who in time of war are trodden down to the earth, i.e., cruelly treated. The other two crimes mentioned, vv. 35 and 36, are among the sins of which Judah and Israel have been guilty, - the former being an offence against the proper administration of justice, and the latter falling under the category of unjust practices in the intercourse of ordinary life. "To pervert the right of a man before the face of the Most High" does not mean, in general, proterve, et sine ull numinis inspectantis reverenti (C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller); but just as &#1492;&#1496;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is taken from the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>, etc.), so also is &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; to be explained in accordance with the directions given in the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-9.htm">Exodus 22:9</a>), that certain clauses were to be brought before &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, where this word means the judge or judges pronouncing sentence in the name of God; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>, where the judges, as God's representatives, are called &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;. "Before the face of the Most High" thus means, before the tribunal which is held in the name of the Most High. "To turn aside a man in his cause" means to pervert his right in a dispute (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm">Job 8:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/34-12.htm">Job 34:12</a>, etc.), which may also be done in contested matters that do not come before the public tribunal. The meaning of the three verses depends on the explanation given of &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, which is a disputed point. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with &#1500;, "to look on something," may mean to care for it, be concerned about it, but not to select, choose, or to resolve upon, approve (Michaelis, Ewald, Thenius). Nor can the prophet mean to say, "The Lord does not look upon the treading down of the prisoners, the perversion of justice." If any one be still inclined, with Rosenmller and others, to view the words as the expression of a fact, then he must consider them as an exception taken by those who murmur against God, but repelled in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37</a>. Moreover, he must, in some such way as the following, show the connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34</a>, by carrying out the idea presented in the exhortation to hope for compassion: "But will any one say that the Lord knows nothing of this - does not trouble Himself about such sufferings?" Whereupon, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37</a>, the answer follows: "On the contrary, nothing happens without the will of God" (Gerlach). But there is no point of attachment that can possibly be found in the words of the text for showing such a connection; we must therefore reject this view as being artificial, and forced upon the text. The difficulty is solved in a simple manner, by taking the words &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488;  as a question, just as has been already done in the Chaldee paraphrase: fierine potest ut in conspectu Jovae non reveletur? The absence of the interrogative particle forms no objection to this, inasmuch as a question is pretty often indicated merely by the tone. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-38.htm">Lamentations 3:38</a> must also be taken interrogatively. B&#1510;ttcher and Thenius, indeed, think that the perfect &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is incompatible with this; but the objection merely tells against the rendering, "Should not the Lord see it?" (De Wette, Maurer, Kalkschmidt), which of course would require &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;. But the idea rather is, "Hath not the Lord looked upon this?" The various acts of injustice mentioned in the three verses are not set forth merely as possible events, but as facts that have actually occurred.</body></html>
