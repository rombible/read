Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord is my portion - "My portion is Yahweh," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a> ff.<p>Therefore will I hope in him - A more full expression of the confidence present in the prophet's mind in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21</a>, but based now upon God's faithfulness in showing mercy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

The prophet, or the church, whom he represents, rises and increases in the exercise of faith; from considering the mercies, compassions, and faithfulness of God, concludes a sure and firm interest in him, as a portion and inheritance. The Lord is the portion of his people in life and in death, in time and to eternity; all he is, and has, is theirs; they are heirs of him, and shall enjoy him for ever, and therefore shall not be consumed; he is a portion large and full, inexpressibly rich and great, a soul satisfying one, and will last for ever. And happy are those, who from their hearts, and with their souls, under a testimony of the Spirit of God to their spirits, and through a gracious experience of him, can say he is their portion and exceeding great reward, as the church here did; and these may say with her, as follows: <p>therefore will I hope in him: for deliverance from all evils and enemies; for present supplies of grace; and for the enjoyment of future glory and happiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD <i>is</i> my <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</span><p>(l) The godly put their whole confidence in God, and therefore look for no other inheritance, as Ps 16:5.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">The Lord is my portion</span>] a frequent expression in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-26.htm" title="My flesh and my heart fails: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.">Psalm 73:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-57.htm" title="You are my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep your words.">Psalm 119:57</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm" title="I cried to you, O LORD: I said, You are my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.">Psalm 142:5</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is my Portion.</span> A reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-57.htm">Psalm 119:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-17.htm">Lamentations 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-18.htm">Lamentations 3:18</a> the speaker, in his lamentation, gives expression to that disposition of his heart which has been produced by the misery that has befallen him to so fearful an extent. He has quite given up hopes of attaining safety and prosperity, and his hope in the Lord is gone. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-17.htm">Lamentations 3:17</a> it is a question whether &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1495; is second or third pers. of the imperf. Following the lxx, who give the rendering &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, Rosenmller, Gesenius, De Wette, and Ngelsbach consider &#1494;&#1504;&#1495; transitive, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>, and take &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1495; as of the second pers.: "Thou didst reject my soul (me) from peace." But to this view of the words there is the decided objection, that neither before nor after is there any direct address to Jahveh, and that the verbs which immediately follow stand in the first person, and succeed the first clause appropriately enough, provided we take &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; as the subject to &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1495; (third pers.). &#1494;&#1504;&#1495; has both a transitive and an intransitive meaning in Kal; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-3.htm">Hosea 8:3</a> (trans.) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5</a> (intrans.). Ngelsbach has no ground for casting doubt on the intrans. meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5</a>. Moreover, the objection that the passage now before us is a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-15.htm">Psalm 88:15</a> (Ngelsbach) does not prove that &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1495; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is to be taken in the same sense here as in that passage: "O Jahveh, Thou despisest my soul." By adding &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, Jeremiah has made an independent reproduction of that passage in the Psalms, if he had it before his mind. This addition does not permit of our attaching a transitive sense to &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1504;&#1495;, for the verb means to despise, not to reject; hence we cannot render the words, "Thou didst reject my soul from peace." The meaning of the clause is not "my soul loathes prosperity," as it is rendered by Thenius, who further gives the sense as follows: "I had such a thorough disgust for life, that I had no longer the least desire for prosperity." As Gerlach has already remarked, this explanation neither harmonizes with the meaning of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, not with the expression of doubt in the following verse, which implies a very lively "sense of the prosperous;" moreover, it has no good lexical basis. The fundamental meaning of &#1494;&#1504;&#1495; is to stink, be rancid, from which comes the metaphorical one of instilling disgust, - not, feeling disgust (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5</a>), - and further, that of despising. The meaning "to instil disgust" does not suit this passage, but only that of being despised. "My soul is despised of prosperity," i.e., so that it shares not in prosperity; with this accords the intransitive use of the Hiphil &#1492;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; with &#1502;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-14.htm">2 Chronicles 11:14</a>. The Vulgate, which does not catch the idea of &#1494;&#1504;&#1495; so exactly, renders the passage by expulsa est a pace anima mea. To this there are appropriately joined the words, "I have forgotten good" (good fortune), because I constantly experience nothing but misfortune; and not less appropriate is the expression of doubt, "I say (i.e., I think) my strength and my hope from Jahveh is gone (vanished)," i.e., my strength is worn out through suffering, and I have nothing more to hope for from Jahveh. Starting from the fundamental idea of stability, permanence, &#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, according to the traditional explanation, means vigor, strength; then, by a metaphor, vis vitalis, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-6.htm">Isaiah 63:6</a>, - not trust (Rosenmller, Thenius, Ngelsbach, etc.), in support of which we are pointed to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>, but without sufficient reason; see Delitzsch on Isaiah, l.c. The complaint here attains its deepest and worst. The complainant in his thoughts has gone far from God, and is on the very verge of despair. But here also begins the turning-point. When for the first time he utters the name of God in the expression "my hope from Jahveh," he shows that Jahveh is to him also still the ground of hope and trust. Hence also he not merely complains, "my strength is gone," etc., but introduces this thought with the words &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, "I said," sc. in my heart, i.e., I thought, "my strength is gone, and my hope from Jahveh lost," i.e., vanished. The mention of the name Jahveh, i.e., the Covenant-God, keeps him from sinking into despair, and urges him not to let go his trust on the Lord, so that he can now (in what follows) complain to the Lord of his state of distress, and beseech His help.</body></html>
