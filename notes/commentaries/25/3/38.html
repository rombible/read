We are sinful men, and what we complain of, is far less than our sins deserve. We should complain to God, and not of him. We are apt, in times of calamity, to reflect on other people's ways, and blame them; but our duty is to search and try our own ways, that we may turn from evil to God. Our hearts must go with our prayers. If inward impressions do not answer to outward expressions, we mock God, and deceive ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why then does a loving God, who disapproves of suffering when inflicted by man upon man, Himself send sorrow and misery? "Because of sins."<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37</a><p>Literally, "Who is this that spake and it was done, though &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'a&#774;dona&#772;y commanded it not?"<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. evil &#8230; good&#8212;Calamity and prosperity alike proceed from God (Job 2:10; Isa 45:7; Am 3:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In the Hebrew the form of these words is interrogatory, as much as if he should say, Doth not evil come out of Godâ€™s mouth from his direction and command, and from his providence, as well as good? He speaks of evils of punishment, judicial afflictive dispensations; so it agreeth with <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm" title="But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks.

It is no reproach unto God to make him the author of his own punishments, though we call them evil. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Out of the mouth of the most High proceed not evil and good? Certainly they do; they come to pass, both one and the other, as God has pronounced, and his will determined; even "evils", as it is in the plural number; not the evil of sin, or of fault; this comes not out of the mouth of God, but is forbidden and condemned by him; much less is he the author of it, or tempter to it; indeed it is not without his knowledge, nor in some sense without his will; not with his will of approbation, but by his permissive will, which he suffers to be, and overrules for good; but evils here design the judgments of God, or punishment inflicted on sinners, and chastisement on his own people; the evil of affliction, or adverse dispensations of providence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>; they are all by his appointment; he has said or determined what shall be the kind and nature of them; the measure, how far they shall go; and the duration, how long they shall last; and the end and use of them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>; and so all good comes from God, who is goodness itself; all created good, as every creature of God is good; every good thing in providence; all temporal good things; as to have a being; to be preserved in it; to have a habitation to dwell in; to have food and raiment, health and long life; these are all by the appointment of God, and according to the determination of his will: all spiritual good things are purposed, promised, and prepared by him in council and covenant; the great good of all, salvation by Christ; this is what God has appointed his son far, and his people to, and fixed the time of it, and all things relating to it; the effectual calling of the redeemed ones is according to his purpose and grace; the persons, thing itself, time, place, and means; also eternal glory and happiness, which is the kingdom prepared, the crown laid up, and inheritance reserved in heaven, according to the purpose of God; all good things, in time and eternity, are as God has pronounced them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> evil and good?</span><p>(s) That is, adversity and prosperity, Am 3:6.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm" title="I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.">Isaiah 45:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm" title="Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD has not done it?">Amos 3:6</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Let him also learn patiently to bear abuse and reviling from men. Let him present his cheek to him who smites him, as was done by Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>) and the servant of Jahveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>. On <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/123-3.htm">Psalm 123:3</a>, etc. There is a certain gradation in the three verses that it quite unmistakeable. The sitting alone and in silence is comparatively the easiest; it is harder to place the mouth in the dust, and yet cling to hope; it is most difficult of all to give the cheek to the smiter, and to satiate oneself with dishonour (Ngelsbach). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a> follow the grounds of comfort. The first is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31</a> : the sorrow will come to an end; the Lord does not cast off for ever; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>. The second is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-32.htm">Lamentations 3:32</a> : when He has caused sorrow, He shows pity once more, according to the fulness of His grace. Compassion outweighs sorrow. On this subject, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>. The third ground of comfort is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a> : God does not send affliction willingly, as if it brought Him joy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a>), but merely because chastisement is necessary to sinful man for the increase of his spiritual prosperity; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; is for &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;: cf. Ewald, 232, f; Gesenius, 69, 3, Rem. 6.<p>That he may bring home to the hearts of God's people the exhortation to bear suffering with patience and resignation, and that he may lead them to see that the weight of sorrow under which they are sighing has been sent from the Lord as a chastisement for their sins, the prophet carries out the thought, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34-39</a>, that every wrong committed upon earth is under the divine control (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34-36</a>), and generally that nothing happens without God's permission; hence man ought not to mourn over the suffering that befalls him, but rather over his sins (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37-39</a>).</body></html>
