Prayer is the breath of the new man, drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises; it proves and maintains the spiritual life. He silenced their fears, and quieted their spirits. Thou saidst, Fear not. This was the language of God's grace, by the witness of his Spirit with their spirits. And what are all our sorrows, compared with those of the Redeemer? He will deliver his people from every trouble, and revive his church from every persecution.

This is to be connected with the preceding words; and expresses the same thing in different language. The sense is, that the Lord heard the words which dropped from the lips of his enemies; their sarcasms, flouts, and jeers; their bitter reflections, severe invectives, and scornful language: <p>and their device against me all the day; or, "their meditation of ill against me"; or, "their speech", or discourse (x); which all turned upon the same topic. Schultens (y) derives the word from the Arabic word which signifies to mock and scoff, or pursue anyone with ironical and satirical expressions; and so may intend here contumelious and reproachful language. <p>(x) "meditationem istorum", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "loquelam eorum", Michaelis.

B. Michaelis, Rosenmller, etc.), - since the asyndetic &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497; does not accord with such an interpretation, - but a relieving of oneself by means of deeply-drawn sighs, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-20.htm">Job 32:20</a>; hence "sighing," as Luther has already rendered it, following the Vulgate: ne avertas aurem tuum a singultu meo (Thenius, Gerlach, etc.). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-57.htm">Lamentations 3:57</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-58.htm">Lamentations 3:58</a>, the writer still more fully expresses his confidence that the Lord will accept him. "Thou art near on the day when I call on Thee" is a sentence found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>, and uttered as the experience of all believers. "Thou sayest, Fear not," i.e., Thou assurest me of Thine assistance; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>, etc. "Thou dost conduct the causes (Ger. Streitsachen) of my soul" (&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;), i.e., not merely "my lawsuits," but causas quae vitam et salutem meam concernunt (C. B. Michaelis). This is shown by the parallel member, "Thou redeemest my life," sc. from the destruction which threatens it; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-53.htm">Lamentations 3:53</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-4.htm">Psalm 103:4</a>. With this is connected the request in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-59.htm">Lamentations 3:59</a>, "Thou dost certainly see my oppression" (&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, to bend, oppress), the oppression which I suffer; "judge my cause," i.e., help me in my cause, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>. The suppliant bases this request, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-60.htm">Lamentations 3:60-62</a>, on the recollection that God, as the Omniscient One, knows the plans and intentions of his opponents. "Thou seest all their plans for revenge." &#1504;&#1511;&#1502;&#1492; is not here the outcome of revenge, but the thought of revenge cherished in the heart; it does not, however, mean desire of revenge, or revengeful disposition, but simply the thinking and meditating on revenge, which certainly has the spirit of revenge for its basis, but is not identical with this. Their thoughts are the plans of vengeance.  ,&#1500;&#1497;dat. incomm., "to my hurt;" the reading &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; of some codices is simply a correction after <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-61.htm">Lamentations 3:61</a>. This revenge they express in reproaches and invectives. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;, "lips," for utterances of the lips; and &#1511;&#1502;&#1497; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-40.htm">Psalm 18:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>  equals  &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>, etc. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497; &#1511;&#1502;&#1497; corresponds to &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, and &#1495;&#1490;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; to &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-61.htm">Lamentations 3:61</a>; and the whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-62.htm">Lamentations 3:62</a> still depends on "Thou hearest," without any need for supplying &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, as Rosenmller does. Thenius and Ngelsbach would combine <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-62.htm">Lamentations 3:62</a> with 63, and make the former dependent on &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;; but this is unsuitable, nor do they consider that utterances or words are not seen (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;), but heard (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;). With this proposed combination there falls to the ground the further remark of Thenius, that "by lips, devising, sitting, rising up, are meant the conversation and consultation of the enemies one with another." Sitting and rising up have nothing in common with speaking about any subject, but merely form a circumlocution for action generally: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-19.htm">Deuteronomy 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-28.htm">Isaiah 37:28</a>. The form &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; occurs nowhere else: Ewald considers it a form that has been lengthened for the purpose of designating a mocking song - "Sing-song." This supposition has at least more to recommend it than the ingenious but worthless idea of Bttcher, that &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is contracted from &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, "what a stringed instrument am I to them;" but it also is improbable. &#1502;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is the subject of the &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, as words formed with &#1502; often express merely the subject of the idea contained in a noun or verb; cf. Ewald, 160, b, 3. After this statement of the hostile treatment which the speaker has to suffer, there follows the renewed and further extended request that God may reward the foes according to their deeds. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, "Thou shalt return," is a confident expression of the request that God would do this; hence the optative &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-65.htm">Lamentations 3:65</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-64.htm">Lamentations 3:64</a> is condensed the substance of what is contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/28-4.htm">Psalm 28:4</a>. &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;, covering (veil) of the heart, - an expression analogous to the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>, - is not obduration, or hardening, but blinding of the heart, which casts into destruction; but it can scarcely signify "madness" (Delitzsch, Bibl. Psychology, Clark's translation), since the Arabic majannat, insania, furor, has probably received this meaning from jinn, genius, daemon; cf. Gesenius, Thes. s. v., and Rosenmller, ad h. l. "Thy curse to them!" is not to be viewed as dependent on "give," but to be explained in accordance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/3-9.htm">Psalm 3:9</a>, "Thy blessing [be] upon Thy people!" - thus, "May Thy curse be their portion!" The curse of God is followed by destruction. "Destroy them from under Jahveh's heaven!" i.e., not merely ut non sint amplius sub caelis (C. B. Michaelis), because &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is not considered in this latter rendering. The heaven of Jahveh is the whole world, over which Jahveh's authority extends; the meaning therefore is, "Exterminate them wholly from the sphere of Thy dominion in the world," or, Thy kingdom. </body></html>
