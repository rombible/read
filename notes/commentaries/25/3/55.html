Prayer is the breath of the new man, drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises; it proves and maintains the spiritual life. He silenced their fears, and quieted their spirits. Thou saidst, Fear not. This was the language of God's grace, by the witness of his Spirit with their spirits. And what are all our sorrows, compared with those of the Redeemer? He will deliver his people from every trouble, and revive his church from every persecution. He will save believers with everlasting salvation, while his enemies perish with everlasting destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A prayer for deliverance and for vengeance upon his enemies.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55</a><p>Out of the low dungeon - "The lowest pit" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-6.htm">Psalm 88:6</a>.
