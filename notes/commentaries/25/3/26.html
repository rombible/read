Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And quietly wait - literally, "and be in silence," i. e. abstain from all complaining.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. quietly wait&#8212;literally, "be in silence." Compare La 3:28 and Ps 39:2, 9, that is, to be patiently quiet under afflictions, resting in the will of God (Ps 37:7). So Aaron (Le 10:2, 3); and Job (Job 40:4, 5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Good</span> here either signifies <span class="ital">honestum</span>, what becomes men, and is their duty; or utile, what is profitable, and will turn to good account to them. <span class="ital">Hoping</span> and <span class="ital">waiting</span> differ but as the mother and daughter, hope being the mother of patience and waiting; or as the <span class="ital">habit</span> and <span class="ital">act</span>, hoping and waiting being ranch the same, flowing from a gracious power and habit given the soul to wait. <span class="ital">Quietness</span> is necessary to waiting, for all turbulency and impatience of spirit under sad providences is opposed to waiting. <span class="ital">The salvation of the Lord</span> refers to the outward man, in preserving or delivering us from dangers; or to the soul and inward man, in preserving us from, and delivering our souls out of, dangers they fear, or evils they are pressed with. Now for a man in the midst of all evils to hope in God, and, without turbulence or disorder in himself, to wait for a preservation from, or a delivery out of, any evils, is what becometh a man, (a child of God especially,) and will turn to a good account to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait,.... This follows from the former; for if God is good to such, it must be good for them to hope and wait for him; it is both their duty and their interest: and it may be observed, that hope is the ground of patient waiting, and is here promised to it; where there is no hope of a thing, there will be no waiting for it, much less quietly: hope is of things unseen, future, difficult, and yet possible, or there would be no hope; and where there is that, there will be waiting; for "if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it", <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-25.htm">Romans 8:25</a>; here in the original text it is, "hope, and be silent" (z); or, "a good man will both hope" or "wait, and be silent" (a); that is, under the present dispensation, though an afflictive one; men should be still, as David exhorts, and be dumb, as he was; and hold their peace, as Aaron did, at such seasons: not that they should indulge a stoical apathy, or be insensible of their condition, and disregard the rod, and him that has appointed it, or be altogether silent and speechless; but should own the hand of God, and their deserts, cry to him for deliverance, be thankful it is no worse, and speak of the gracious dealings of God with them; yet should not murmur and complain, or charge God foolishly; but be resigned to his will, and wait the issue of Providence quietly, even wait <p>for the salvation of the Lord; for temporal deliverance from outward evils and present afflictions, and for spiritual and eternal salvation. The saints, under the Old Testament, waited for Christ, the author of salvation, appointed and promised by the Lord. He is come, and has obtained salvation, which is published in the Gospel. Sensible sinners are made acquainted with their need of it, and see the fulness and suitableness of it, and are earnestly desirous of knowing their interest in it; this is not immediately had; it is good to wait quietly for it, in an attendance on the word and ordinances; and this being come at, still the complete enjoyment is yet behind: saints are now heirs of it, are kept unto it; it is nearer them than when they believed; Christ will appear unto it, and it becomes them to wait patiently for it; which will be a salvation from the very being of sin; from the temptations of Satan; from all troubles inward and outward; from all troublesome persons and things; from all doubts, fears, darkness, and unbelief; and will consist in perfect happiness and glory, and is worth waiting for. <p>(z)  "et expectet et silens", Pagninus, Montanus; "qui et expectat et silet", Piscator.

The thought of the verse is that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The view taken of this verse will depend on the answer to the question whether &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512; is second or third pers. fem. Following in the wake of Luther ("Thou wilt assuredly think thereon"), C. B. Michaelis, Pareau, Rosenmller, and Kalkschmidt take it as second pers.: "Think, yea, think wilt Thou, that my soul is bowed down in me," or "that my soul is at rest within me" (Ngelsbach). But it is impossible to maintain either of these views in the face of the language employed. To take the &#1493; before &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495; in the meaning of quod is characterized by Ngelsbach as an arbitrary procedure, unwarranted either by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>; but neither can the meaning of resting, being at east, which is attributed to &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495; by that writer, be established. The verb means to sink down, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>, and metaphorically, to be bowed down, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-26.htm">Psalm 44:26</a>. The latter meaning is required in the present passage, from the simple fact that the sentence undeniably refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a>.<p>(Note: Luther's translation, "for my soul tells me," is founded on the circumstance that the lxx have mistaken &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495; for &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1495;: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;.)<p>&#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495; expresses the consequence of &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, which therefore can only be the third pers., and "my soul" the subject of both clauses; for there is no logical consecution of the meaning given by such a rendering as, "If Thou wilt remember, my soul shall be bowed within me." The expression, "If my soul duly meditates thereon (on the deep suffering), it becomes depressed within me," forms the foundation of the request that God would think of his distress, his misery; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21</a>, "I will lay this to heart," connects itself with the leading thought set forth in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a>, the reason for which is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-20.htm">Lamentations 3:20</a>, viz., that my soul is only bowed down within me over the thought of my distress, and must complain of it to God, that He may think of it and alleviate it: This will I lay to heart and set my hope upon. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is a strong inferential expression: "therefore," because God alone can help, will I hope. This self-encouragement begins with <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>, inasmuch as the prophet strengthens his hope by a consideration of the infinite compassion of the Lord. (It is) &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;, "the mercies of God," i.e., proofs of His mercy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-43.htm">Psalm 107:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a>), "that we are not utterly consumed," as Luther and similarly our English translators have excellently rendered &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. This form stands for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-18.htm">Jeremiah 44:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-13</a> :28, not for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, third pers., as Pareau, Thenius, Vaihinger, and Ewald, referring to his Grammar, 84, b, would take it. The proofs of the grace of God have their foundation in His compassion, from which they flow. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a> we take &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;&#1497;  as the subject of &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;; it is the proofs of the grace of God that are new every morning, not "His compassions," although the idea remains the same. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, every morning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-14.htm">Psalm 73:14</a>. Ubi sol et dies oritur, simul et radii hujus inexhaustae bonitatis erumpunt (Tarnovius in Rosenmller). The consciousness of this constant renewal of the divine favour impels to the prayerful exclamation, "great is Thy faithfulness;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>.</body></html>
