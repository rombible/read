Prayer is the breath of the new man, drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises; it proves and maintains the spiritual life. He silenced their fears, and quieted their spirits. Thou saidst, Fear not. This was the language of God's grace, by the witness of his Spirit with their spirits. And what are all our sorrows, compared with those of the Redeemer? He will deliver his people from every trouble, and revive his church from every persecution.

The verb &#1497;&#1491;&#1492; construed with &#1489;&#1468; does not take this meaning, for &#1497;&#1491;&#1492; merely signifies to cast, e.g., lots (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3</a>, etc.), arrows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-14.htm">Jeremiah 50:14</a>), or to throw down  equals  destroy, annihilate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm">Zechariah 2:4</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean "in the pit in which I was," but "upon (or against) me." The sing. &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; is to be understood in accordance with the expression &#1512;&#1490;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1503;, to cast stones  equals  stone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-18.htm">1 Kings 12:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>). As to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, see on &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a>. "Waters flowed over my head" is a figurative expression, denoting such misery and distress as endanger life; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/59-2.htm">Psalm 59:2-3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-15.htm">Psalm 59:15</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>. 'I said (thought), I am cut off (from God's eyes or hand)," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">Psalm 31:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/88-6.htm">Psalm 88:6</a>, is a reminiscence from these Psalms, and does not essentially differ from "cut off out of the land of the living," <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>. For, that we must thereby think of death, or sinking down into Sheol, is shown by &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55</a>. The complaint in these verses (52-54) is regarded by some expositors as a description of the personal sufferings of Jeremiah; and the casting into the pit is referred to the incident mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>. Such is the view, for instance, taken by Vaihinger and Ngelsbach, who point for proof to these considerations especially: (1) That the Chaldeans certainly could not, without good cause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-53.htm">Lamentations 3:53</a>), be understood as the "enemies;" (2) that Jeremiah could not represent the people, speaking as if they were righteous and innocent; and (3) that the writer already speaks of his deliverance from their power, and contents himself with merely calling down on them the vengeance of God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55-66</a>). But not one of these reasons is decisive. For, in the first place, the contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a> do not harmonize with the known hostility which Jeremiah had to endure from his personal enemies. That is to say, there is nothing mentioned or known of his enemies having stoned him, or having covered him over with a stone, after they had cast him into the miry pit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>.), The figurative character of the whole account thus shows itself in the very fact that the separate portions of it are taken from reminiscences of passages in the Psalms, whose figurative character is universally acknowledged. Moreover, in the expression &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497; &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, even when we understand thereby the Chaldeans, it is not at all implied that he who complains of these enemies considers himself righteous and innocent, but simply that he has not given them any good ground for their hostile conduct towards him. And the assertion, that the writer is already speaking of his deliverance from their power, rests on the erroneous notion that, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55-66</a>, he is treating of past events; whereas, the interchange of the perfects with imperatives of itself shows that the deliverance of which he there speaks is not an accomplished or bygone fact, but rather the object of that assured faith which contemplates the non-existent as existent. Lastly, the contrast between personal suffering ad the suffering of the people, on which the whole reasoning rests, is quite beside the mark. Moreover, if we take the lamentations to be merely symbolical, then the sufferings and persecutions of which the prophet here complains are not those of the people generally, but of the godly Israelites, on whom they were inflicted when the kingdom was destroyed, not merely by the Chaldeans, but also by their godless fellow-countrymen. Hence we cannot, of course, say that Jeremiah here speaks from personal experience; however, he complains not merely of the persecutions that befall him personally, but also of the sufferings that had come on him and all godly ones. The same remark applies to the conclusion of this lamentation, - the prayer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55-66</a>, in which he entreats the Lord for deliverance, and in the spirit of faith views this deliverance as already accomplished.</body></html>
