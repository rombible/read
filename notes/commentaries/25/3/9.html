In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup. The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe. But the weakest believer is wrong, if he thinks that his strength and hope are perished from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Inclosed - Or, hedged <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7</a>.<p>Hath, made crooked - Or, "hath" turned aside.

Nay, God had not only defeated their counsels, but had made them prove more fatal and pernicious to themselves, which seemeth to be intended, by making their ways crooked, which should have led right on to the end intended. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone,.... Not with a hedge of thorns, or mud walls, but with a fence of stones; and these not rough, and laid loosely together, but hewn and put in order, and well cemented. The Targum is, with marble hewn stones, which are harder than common stones, and not so easily demolished; this may respect the case of the prophet in prison, and in the dungeon, and in Jerusalem, when besieged; or in general his afflictive state, from whence he had no prospect of deliverance; or the state of the Jews in captivity, from which there was no likelihood of a release; <p>he hath made my paths crooked; or, "perverted my ways" (h); so that he could not find his way out, when he attempted it; he got into a way which led him wrong; everything went cross and against him, and all his measures were disconcerted, and his designs defeated; no one step he took prospered. <p>(h)  "semitas meas pervertit", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus, Calvin; "contorsit", Michealis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He hath <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</span><p>(d) And keeps me in hold as a prisoner.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">hath made my paths crooked</span>] The writer, seeing that the direct way was as it were blocked, tried side paths, but found that they also failed to lead him in the desired direction. The figure expresses perplexity and dismay.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> -  <span class="cmt_word">Inclosed</span>; or, <span class="accented">walled up</span>; the participle of this verb is rendered "masons" in the Authorized Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-12.htm">2 Kings 12:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Made my paths crooked;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> hath compelled me to walk in byways (comp. margin of the Authorized Version, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>). But this hardly seems appropriate to the context. The <span class="accented">semitas meas subvertit</span> of the Vulgate is preferable. Render, therefore, <span class="accented">turned my path upside down</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>). An analogous expression m <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-13.htm">Job 30:13</a> is rendered in the Authorized Version, "they mar my path." Thenius thinks that the destruction of a raised causeway is the figure intended; but the word is quite correctly rendered "paths;" see the note of Delitzsch on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschIsaiah 59:8. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Only upon (against) me does He repeatedly turn His hand." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is subordinated to the idea of &#1497;&#1492;&#1508;&#1498; in an adverbial sense; cf. Gesenius, 142, 3, b. "His hand" is the smiting hand of God. &#1488;&#1498;, "only upon me," expresses the feeling which makes him on whom grievous sufferings have fallen to regard himself as one smitten in a special manner by God. "The whole day," i.e., continually; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>. - From <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-4.htm">Lamentations 3:4</a> onwards this divine chastisement is more minutely set forth under various figures, and first of all as a wasting away of the vital force. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; means to wear out by rubbing, cause to fall away, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, to be worn out, which is applied to clothes, and then transferred to bodies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a>. "Flesh and skin" are the exterior and soft constituents of the body, while the bones are the firmer parts. Skin, flesh, and bones together, make up the substance of the human body. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a> forms the foundation of the first clause. "He hath broken my bones" is a reminiscence from the lamentation of Hezekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>. The meaning is thus excellently given by Pareau: indicantur animi, fortius irae divinae malorumque sensu conquassati, angores. - The figure in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-5.htm">Lamentations 3:5</a>, "He builds round about and encircles me," is derived from the enclosing of a city by besieging it. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is to be repeated after wayaqeep. The besieging forces, which encompass him so that he cannot go out and in, are &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;. That the former of these two words cannot mean &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (lxx), is abundantly evident. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; or &#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is a plant with a very bitter taste, hence a poisonous plant; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>. As in that passage &#1502;&#1497; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, so here the simple &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is an emblem of bitter suffering. The combination with &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, "toil," is remarkable, as a case in which a figurative is joined with a literal expression; this, however, does not justify the change of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; into &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (Castell, Schleussner, etc.). The combination is to be explained on the ground that &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; had become so common a symbol of bitter suffering, that the figure was quite lost sight of behind the thing signified.</body></html>
