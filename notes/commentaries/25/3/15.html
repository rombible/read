The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe.

"He hath walled in my paths with hewn stones." &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#1490;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514;  &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-31.htm">1 Kings 5:31</a>, are hewn stones of considerable size, employed for making a very strong wall. The meaning is: He has raised up insurmountable obstacles in the pathway of my life. "My paths hath He turned," i.e., rendered such that I cannot walk in them. &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is to turn, in the sense of destroying, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>, not contortas fecit (Michaelis, Rosenmller, Kalkschmidt), nor per viam tortuosam ire cogor (Raschi); for the prophet does not mean to say (as Ngelsbach imagines), "that he has been compelled to walk in wrong and tortuous ways," but he means that God has rendered it impossible for him to proceed further in his path; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-13.htm">Job 30:13</a>. But we are not in this to think of the levelling of a raised road, as Thenius does; for &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; does not mean a road formed by the deposition of rubbish, like a mound, but a footpath, formed by constant treading (Gerlach).</body></html>
