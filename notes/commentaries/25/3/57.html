Prayer is the breath of the new man, drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises; it proves and maintains the spiritual life. He silenced their fears, and quieted their spirits. Thou saidst, Fear not. This was the language of God's grace, by the witness of his Spirit with their spirits. And what are all our sorrows, compared with those of the Redeemer? He will deliver his people from every trouble, and revive his church from every persecution. He will save believers with everlasting salvation, while his enemies perish with everlasting destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast heard - In sending Ebedmelech to deliver me.

God is never far off from any of us, as to his essential presence; nor is it possible that he should, for he filleth all places. But he is said to be near us or far off from us, as he manifests, or doth not manifest, his goodness to us by acts of gracious providence: of that drawing near the text speaketh. God being infinite in goodness and mercy, is spoken of as absent from those persons and places where he is not showing mercy, and present only there where he showeth forth his goodness, and to be drawing nigh to them to whom he beginneth to show mercy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou saidst, Fear not; </span> thou didst encourage me formerly upon my prayer. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee,....

The expression does not merely signify "causes me grief" (Thenius, Gerlach); but the eye, weakened through incessant weeping, causes pain to the soul, inasmuch as the pain in the eye increases the pain in the soul, i.e., heightens the pain of the soul through the superaddition of physical pain (Ngelsbach). Ewald has quite missed the meaning of the verse in his translation, "Tears assail my soul," and in his explanatory remark that &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; is used in a bad sense, like the Latin afficit; for, if &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; had this meaning, &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; could not stand for tears, because it is not the tears, but only the eyes weakened by weeping, that affect the soul with pain. Ewald is also wrong in seeking, with Grotius, to understand "the daughters of my city" as signifying the country towns, and to explain the phrase by referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-22.htm">Lamentations 2:22</a>. For, apart from the consideration that the appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-22.htm">Lamentations 2:22</a> rests on a false conception of that passage, the meaning attributed to the present verse is shown to be untenable by the very fact that the expression "daughters of my city" is never used for the daughter-towns of Jerusalem; and such a designation, however possible it might be in itself, would yet be quite incomprehensible in this present connection, where there is no other subject of lamentation, either before or after, than Jerusalem in its ruined condition, and the remnant of its inhabitants (Gerlach). "The daughters of my city" are the daughters of Jerusalem, the female portion of the inhabitants of the city before and after its destruction. Nor will what is added, "because of the daughters of my city," seem strange, if we consider that, even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-18.htm">Lamentations 1:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20-21</a>, the fate and the wretched condition of the virgins of the city are mentioned as peculiarly deplorable, and that, in fact, the defenceless virgins were most to be pitied when the city fell; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-11.htm">Lamentations 5:11</a>. But the objection of Bttcher and Thenius, that &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; forms a harsh construction, whether we view it grammatically or in the light of the circumstances, inasmuch as &#1502;&#1503;, after "mine eye pains me," is unsuitable, whether taken in a causal or a comparative meaning: - this objection, certainly, has some truth in its favour, and tells against any attempt to take the words as indicating a comparison. but there is nothing against the causal meaning, if "mine eyes causes pain to my soul" merely signifies "my eye pains me," because the pain of the eye is the result of the profuse weeping. If those words, however, possess the meaning we have given above (the pain in the eyes increases the smart in the soul), then there is nothing strange at all in the thought, "The evil condition of the daughters of my city is so deplorable, that mine eyes fail through weeping, and the sorrow of my soul is thereby intensified." Gerlach has already refuted, though more fully than was necessary, the conjecture of Bttcher, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; should be changed into &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (from all the weeping of my city).</body></html>
