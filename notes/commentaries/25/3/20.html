The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe.

That is, according to our version, affliction and misery, compared to wormwood and gall: but the words, "my soul", are fetched from the next clause, where they ought to stand, and this to be rendered, "in remembering thou wilt remember" (t); or, "thou wilt surely remember", and so expresses the confidence of the prophet, and his firm belief, his faith and hope increasing in prayer, that God would in much mercy remember his people, and their afflictions, and save them out of them: <p>and is humbled in me; both under the afflicting hand of God, and in view and hope of his mercy: though rather it should be rendered, "and" or "for my soul meditateth within me" (u); says or suggests such things to me, that God will in wrath remember mercy; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-7.htm">Psalm 77:7</a>. So Jarchi makes mention of a Midrash, that interprets it of his soul's waiting till the time that God remembers. <p>(t)  "recordando recordaberis", Luther, Michaelis.

In the next verse we read, "This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope," which seems inconsistent with ver. 20 as given in the Authorized Version. An equally grammatical and still more obvious translation is, <span class="accented">Thou</span> (<span class="accented">O God!</span>) <span class="accented">wilt surely remember, for my soul is bowed down within me.</span> The latter part of the line is a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>, at least, if the text be correct, for the closing words do not cohere well with the opening ones. The Peshito (Syriac) has, "Remember, and revive [literally, 'cause to return'] my soul within me," which involves a slightly different reading of one word. But more tempting than any other view of the meaning is that of Bickell, though it involves a correction and an insertion, "My soul remembereth well and meditateth on thy faithfulness." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Abused in this way, he is the object of scoffing and mockery" (Gerlach). In the first clause, the complaint of Jeremiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a> is reproduced. Rosenmller, Ewald, and Thenius are inclined to take &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; as an abbreviated form of the plur. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, presuming that the subject of the complaint is the people of Israel. But in none of the three passages in which Ewald (Gram. 177, a), following the Masoretes, is ready to recognise such a plural-ending, does there seem any need or real foundation for the assumption. Besides this passage, the others are <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm">Psalm 144:2</a>. In these last two cases &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; gives a suitable enough meaning as a singular (see the expositions of these passages); and in this verse, as Gerlach has already remarked, against Rosenmller, neither the conjoined &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; nor the plural suffix of &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501; requires us to take &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; as a plural, the former objection being removed on a comparison of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-10.htm">Genesis 41:10</a>, and the latter when we consider the possibility of a constructio ad sensum in the case of the collective &#1506;&#1501;. But the assumption that here the people are speaking, or that the poet (prophet) is complaining of the sufferings of the people in their name, is opposed by the fact that &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; stands at the beginning of this lamentation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-1.htm">Lamentations 3:1</a>. If, however, the prophet complained in the name of each individual among God's people, he could not set up &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; in opposition to them, because by that very expression the scoffing is limited to the great body of the people. The Chaldee, accordingly, is substantially correct in its paraphrase, omnibus protervis populi mei (following <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-14.htm">Daniel 11:14</a>). But that the mass of the people were not subdued by suffering, and that there was a great number of those who would not recognise the chastening hand of God in the fall of the kingdom, and who scoffed at the warnings of the prophets, is evinced, not merely by the history of the period immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41.htm">Jeremiah 41</a>ff.), and by the conduct of Ishmael and his followers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2</a>.), and of the insolent men who marched to Egypt in spite of Jeremiah's warning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-2.htm">Jeremiah 43:2</a>), but also by the spirit that prevailed among the exiles, and against which Ezekiel had to contend; cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>. &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501; is a reminiscence from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm">Psalm 69:13</a>.</body></html>
