In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup.

They were like men that lived upon gritty bread, more fit to break their teeth than to nourish them; they were in the state of mourners, and no ordinary mourners, who were wont to throw ashes on their heads, they were all over covered with ashes. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones,.... With gritty bread, such as is made of corn ground with new millstones, the grit of which mixes with the flour; or with stony bread, as Seneca (n) calls a benefit troublesome to others; with bread that has little stones mixed with it, by eating of which the teeth are broken, as Jarchi observes: the phrase signifies afflictions and troubles, which are very grievous and disagreeable, like gravel in the mouth, as sin in its effects often proves, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-17.htm">Proverbs 20:17</a>; <p>he hath covered me with ashes; as mourners used to be; the word rendered "covered" is only used in this place.

The prophet is like one whose teeth are worn away by the continued action of grit mixed with his bread. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-17.htm" title="Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.">Proverbs 20:17</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he hath (unnatural as it may seem in Israel's Father) given me stones instead of bread (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-9.htm">Matthew 7:9</a>). The Jewish rabbi commonly called Rashi thinks that a historical fact is preserved in these words, and that the Jewish exiles were really obliged to eat bread mixed with grit, because they had to bake in pits dug in the ground. So too many later commentators, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Grotius, who compares a passage of Seneca ('De Benefie.,' 2:7), "Beneficium superbe datum simile est pani lapidoso." <span class="cmt_word">He hath covered me with ashes;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he hath pressed me down into ashes.</span> A figurative expression for great humiliation. So in the Talmud the Jewish nation is described as "pressed down into ashes" ('Bereshith Rabba,' 75). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Not merely, however, has God cut off every way of escape for him who here utters the complaint, but He pursues him in every possible way, that He may utterly destroy him. On the figure of a bear lying in wait, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>. It is more usual to find enemies compared to lions in ambush; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-19.htm">Psalm 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-12.htm">Psalm 17:12</a>. The last-named passage seems to have been present to the writer's mind. The prophets frequently compare enemies to lions, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-11.htm">Lamentations 3:11</a> the figure of the lion is discontinued; for cowreer &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; cannot be said of a beast. The verb here is not to be derived from &#1505;&#1512;&#1512;, to be refractory, but is the Pilel of &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to go aside, deviate, make to draw back. To "make ways turn aside" may signify to make a person lose the right road, but not to drag back from the road (Thenius); it rather means to mislead, or even facere ut deficiant viae, to take away the road, so that one cannot escape. &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. in Hebrew; in Aramean it means to cut or tear in pieces: cf. [the Targum on] <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>, "Samuel  &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1495; Agag," hewed him in pieces; and on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>, where the word is used for the Heb. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;, to tear in pieces (of a lion); here it signifies to tear away (limbs from the body, boughs from trees). This meaning is required by the context; for the following expression, &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, does not lead us to think of tearing in pieces, lacerating, but discerpere, plucking or pulling to pieces.
