The sum is: Nothing comes to pass in the world but by the disposal of the divine providence, which is directed by infinite wisdom, justice, and goodness. The inspired writer seems to be arguing himself and the people of God into a quiet submission to the divine will in their afflictions, from the consideration of the hand of God in them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:37-41 While there is life there is hope; and instead of complaining that things are bad, we should encourage ourselves with the hope they will be better. We are sinful men, and what we complain of, is far less than our sins deserve. We should complain to God, and not of him. We are apt, in times of calamity, to reflect on other people's ways, and blame them; but our duty is to search and try our own ways, that we may turn from evil to God. Our hearts must go with our prayers. If inward impressions do not answer to outward expressions, we mock God, and deceive ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why then does a loving God, who disapproves of suffering when inflicted by man upon man, Himself send sorrow and misery?

Some think they are brought in to check the blasphemy of some that spake of what had befallen the Jews as a thing which God had no hand in. Others think they are brought in as expounding that term that went before, <span class="ital">The Lord seeth not</span>. Though God doth not approve of sinful actions, nor incline any man’s heart or will to them, yet God hath a hand in the permission of the most cruel and unjust actions, which he could easily hinder. I should rather incline to interpret them as an argument brought by the prophet in the name of the people of God, arguing themselves into a quiet submission to the afflictive providences under which they laboured from the consideration of the superior hand of God in them; as Christ told Pilate, Thou couldst not have had any power against me, if it had not been given thee from above. <span class="ital">Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it</span>? <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm" title="Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD has not done it?">Amos 3:6</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/lamentations/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass?....

(i) this, or that, or the other thing, he wills and desires, and his heart is set upon: <p>when the Lord commandeth it not? has not willed and decreed it, but determined the contrary; for nothing escapes his knowledge and foreknowledge; or can resist his will; or control his power; or frustrate his councils, and counterwork his designs; whatever schemes men form to get riches, obtain honour, do mischief to others, prolong life to themselves, and perpetuate their names to posterity, being contrary to the purpose of God, never succeed; whenever they do succeed in any of the above instances, it is because God has commanded, or he has determined, it should be so; as in the instances of Joseph's brethren, in their usage of him; and of the Jews, in the crucifixion of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>.

The order of thought in this group is, All events are absolutely in the hands of God. Thus calamity and prosperity come in response to His command.

Let him present his cheek to him who smites him, as was done by Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>) and the servant of Jahveh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>. On <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/123-3.htm">Psalm 123:3</a>, etc. There is a certain gradation in the three verses that it quite unmistakeable. The sitting alone and in silence is comparatively the easiest; it is harder to place the mouth in the dust, and yet cling to hope; it is most difficult of all to give the cheek to the smiter, and to satiate oneself with dishonour (Ngelsbach). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a> follow the grounds of comfort. The first is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31</a> : the sorrow will come to an end; the Lord does not cast off for ever; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>. The second is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-32.htm">Lamentations 3:32</a> : when He has caused sorrow, He shows pity once more, according to the fulness of His grace. Compassion outweighs sorrow. On this subject, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>. The third ground of comfort is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-33.htm">Lamentations 3:33</a> : God does not send affliction willingly, as if it brought Him joy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a>), but merely because chastisement is necessary to sinful man for the increase of his spiritual prosperity; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; is for &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;: cf. Ewald, 232, f; Gesenius, 69, 3, Rem. 6.<p>That he may bring home to the hearts of God's people the exhortation to bear suffering with patience and resignation, and that he may lead them to see that the weight of sorrow under which they are sighing has been sent from the Lord as a chastisement for their sins, the prophet carries out the thought, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34-39</a>, that every wrong committed upon earth is under the divine control (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-34.htm">Lamentations 3:34-36</a>), and generally that nothing happens without God's permission; hence man ought not to mourn over the suffering that befalls him, but rather over his sins (<a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37-39</a>).</body></html>
