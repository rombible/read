In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup. The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe. But the weakest believer is wrong, if he thinks that his strength and hope are perished from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having dwelt upon the difficulties which hemmed in his path, he now shows that there are dangers attending upon escape.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13.

The same thing is signified here as before; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{e}</span> He <i>was</i> to me <i>as</i> a bear lying in wait, <i>and as</i> a lion in secret places.</span><p>(e) He has no pity on me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. Not only misery, but active forms of danger present themselves. We find the bear and lion in conjunction also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-8.htm" title="I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the lobe of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.">Hosea 13:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Was; rather, <span class="accented">is.<span class="cmt_word"></span> As a bear</span>...as <span class="cmt_word">a lion</span>.

The bear is only once mentioned in such a context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>). The two latter passages may possibly have been in the mind of the writer, as Jehovah is in both the subject of the comparison. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/lamentations/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Only upon (against) me does He repeatedly turn His hand." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is subordinated to the idea of &#1497;&#1492;&#1508;&#1498; in an adverbial sense; cf. Gesenius, 142, 3, b. "His hand" is the smiting hand of God. &#1488;&#1498;, "only upon me," expresses the feeling which makes him on whom grievous sufferings have fallen to regard himself as one smitten in a special manner by God. "The whole day," i.e., continually; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>. - From <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-4.htm">Lamentations 3:4</a> onwards this divine chastisement is more minutely set forth under various figures, and first of all as a wasting away of the vital force. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; means to wear out by rubbing, cause to fall away, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, to be worn out, which is applied to clothes, and then transferred to bodies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a>. "Flesh and skin" are the exterior and soft constituents of the body, while the bones are the firmer parts. Skin, flesh, and bones together, make up the substance of the human body. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a> forms the foundation of the first clause. "He hath broken my bones" is a reminiscence from the lamentation of Hezekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>. The meaning is thus excellently given by Pareau: indicantur animi, fortius irae divinae malorumque sensu conquassati, angores. - The figure in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-5.htm">Lamentations 3:5</a>, "He builds round about and encircles me," is derived from the enclosing of a city by besieging it. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is to be repeated after wayaqeep. The besieging forces, which encompass him so that he cannot go out and in, are &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;. That the former of these two words cannot mean &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (lxx), is abundantly evident. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; or &#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; is a plant with a very bitter taste, hence a poisonous plant; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>. As in that passage &#1502;&#1497; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, so here the simple &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is an emblem of bitter suffering. The combination with &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, "toil," is remarkable, as a case in which a figurative is joined with a literal expression; this, however, does not justify the change of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; into &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (Castell, Schleussner, etc.). The combination is to be explained on the ground that &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; had become so common a symbol of bitter suffering, that the figure was quite lost sight of behind the thing signified.</body></html>
