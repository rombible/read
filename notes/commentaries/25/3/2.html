In the time of his trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an affliction that was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bitter cup. The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe. But the weakest believer is wrong, if he thinks that his strength and hope are perished from the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That hath seen affliction - i. e. hath experienced, suffered it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. darkness&#8212;calamity.<p>light&#8212;prosperity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/lamentations/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Darkness</span> in Scripture (metaphorically taken) signifies <span class="ital">ignorance, sin, and misery</span>; and <span class="ital">light</span> signifies <span class="ital">knowledge</span>, a state of grace, or a state of mirth and jollity; they are both here taken in the latter sense, as light is taken, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-16.htm" title="The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor.">Esther 8:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-8.htm" title="Rejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light to me.">Micah 7:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-5.htm" title="Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.">Job 18:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-11.htm" title="Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.">Psalm 97:11</a></span>; and also darkness is used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm" title="Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.">Jeremiah 13:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-29.htm" title="For you are my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.">2 Samuel 22:29</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm" title="Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.">Proverbs 20:20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm" title="A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread on the mountains: a great people and a strong; there has not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.">Joel 2:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-8.htm" title="All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and set darkness on your land, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 32:8</a></span>.

Hence <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a> follows, yet not at once with the summons to prayer, but with the assertion of the fact that this actually takes place: "their heart cries out unto the Lord;" and it is not till after this that there follows the summons to entreat Him incessantly with tears. The perfect &#1510;&#1506;&#1511; represents the crying as already begun, and reaching on to the present (cf. Ewald, 135, b), for which we use the present in German [and in English]. That the suffix in "their heart" does not point to the enemies mentioned at the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>, but to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, is indubitably evident from what is substantially stated in the clause, viz., that crying to the Lord merely indicates the crying to God for help in distress. There is no sufficient reason for Ewald's change of &#1510;&#1506;&#1511; &#1500; into &#1510;&#1506;&#1511;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498;, "outcries of thine heart," i.e., let the cry of thine heart sound forth; still less ground is there for the conjecture of Thenius, that &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; should be changed into &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501;, because this is opposed to the following summons to implore help: other more unnatural changes in the text it were needless to mention. The following clauses, "O wall of the daughter of Zion," etc., do not state how her heart has cried and still cries to the Lord, but bid her constantly go on imploring. Several expositors have taken objection to the direct address, "O wall of the daughter of Zion," and have sought to remove the difficulty by making conjectures. Hence, e.g., Thenius still holds that there is good ground for the objection, saying that there is a wide difference between the poetic expression, "the wall mourns" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-8.htm">Lamentations 2:8</a>), and the summons, "O wall, let tears run down." This difference cannot be denied, yet such personification is not without analogy. A similar summons is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a> : "Howl, O gate" (porta). It is self-evident that it is not the wall simply as such that is considered, but everything besides connected with it, so that the wall is named instead of the city with its inhabitants, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a> gate and city are synonymous. Hence, also, all the faculties of those residing within the wall (eyes, heart, hands) may be ascribed to it, inasmuch as the idea of the wall easily and naturally glides over into that of the daughter of Zion. The expression, "Let tears run down like a stream," is a hyperbole used to indicate the exceeding greatness of the grief. "By day and night" is intensified by the clauses which follow: "give not," i.e., grant not. &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1514; &#1500;&#1498; , "torpidity (stagnation) to thyself." The noun &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., like &#1492;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-49.htm">Lamentations 3:49</a>; the verb &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;, however, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-3.htm">Psalm 77:3</a>, where it is used of the torpidity of the vital spirits, stagnation of the heart. The expression in the text is a poetic one for &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1514;&#1498;: "do not permit thy numbness," i.e., let not thy flood of tears dry up; cf. Ewald, 289, b. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; is the eyeball, not the tears (Pareau); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; comes from &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, to be still, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>. On the thought here presented, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>.</body></html>
