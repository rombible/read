The first, a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-7.htm" title="Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more?">Psalm 77:7</a>, had been of old a favourite thought of the writer’s (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm" title="Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done evil things as you could.">Jeremiah 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm" title="Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.">Jeremiah 3:12</a>). The second (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-32.htm" title="But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.">Lamentations 3:32</a>) rests on the fact that compassion underlies chastisement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm" title="For his anger endures but a moment; in his favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.">Psalm 30:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm" title="For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole.">Job 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm" title="In a little wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, said the LORD your Redeemer.">Isaiah 54:8</a>); the third (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-33.htm" title="For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.">Lamentations 3:33</a>) on the truth that the primary eternal will of God is on the side of love, and that punishment is, as it were, against that will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/lamentations/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/lamentations/3-31.htm" title="For the LORD will not cast off for ever:...">Lamentations 3:31-33</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord will not cast off for ever </span>— The truly penitent that put their trust in him, and sincerely desire and seek reconciliation with him: though he may for a time appear to estrange himself from them, yet he will certainly return to them. <span class="ital">Though he cause grief — </span>Though, as a prudent parent, he may see reason to chastise his people by affliction, yet as a kind and tender Father, who pitieth his children in misery, <span class="ital">according to the multitude, </span>the unspeakable greatness and abundance of <span class="ital">his mercies, </span>he will have compassion upon them. <span class="ital">For he doth not afflict willingly — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מלבו</span>, <span class="ital">from his heart, </span>that is, of his own mere motion, without cause given him by the persons afflicted; or freely and with pleasure; <span class="ital">nor grieve the children of men — </span>Much less his own children.

Bad as things are, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes for us, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of this we have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishing things, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be our comfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many have found it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humble and serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise would have been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patience will work experience, and that experience a hope that makes not ashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness, will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed. If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may we not say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in his word do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction as laid upon us by the hand of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/lamentations/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Reasons for the resignation urged in the previous triplet. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/lamentations/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31-33.

Which is not to be understood of all his creatures; for there are some he does cast off for ever, as the angels that sinned; reprobate men, profligate and abandoned sinners, that live and die impenitent; and unbelievers, carnal professors, and apostates; but not his own special and peculiar people, the people whom he has foreknown and loved with an everlasting love, his spiritual Israel; or, as the Targum supplies it, "his servants"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a>; he may seem for a while to reject them, but not in reality and for ever; as when he hides his face from them, lays his afflicting hand on them, or suffers then, to be afflicted by others, and defers his help, and does not immediately appear to their deliverance and salvation; but in reality he never rejects them from being his people, his servants, and his sons; they have always a place in his heart, and are ever under his eye and care; they continue in his covenant, and abide in his family; and though they may be cast down in their souls, and cast out by men, yet are not cast off by God, neither in youth nor old age, in time or eternity; his love is unchangeable; his purposes firm and unalterable; his counsel, covenant, oath, and promise, immutable; and they are his jewels, his portion, and inheritance; and this is a ground and reason of bearing patiently all afflictions, injuries, and reproaches; for though men cast off, God will not. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/lamentations/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the LORD will not cast off for ever:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/lamentations/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>.

The expression is based on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>, where the Lord says to Aaron, "I am thy portion and thine inheritance;" i.e., Jahveh will be to the tribe of Levi what the other tribes receive in their territorial possessions in Canaan; Levi shall have his possession and enjoyment in Jahveh. The last clause, "therefore will I hope," etc., is a repetition of what is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21</a>, as if by way of refrain.<p>This hope cannot be frustrated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25</a>. The fundamental idea of the section contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25-33</a> is thus stated by Ngelsbach: "The Lord is well disposed towards the children of men under all circumstances; for even when He smites them, He seeks their highest interest: they ought so to conduct themselves in adversity, that it is possible for Him to carry out His designs." On <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-9.htm">Psalm 34:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>; and on the general meaning, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-7.htm">Psalm 69:7</a>. If the Lord is kind to those who hope in Him, then it is good for man to wait patiently for His help in suffering. Such is the mode in which <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a> is attached to <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-25.htm">Lamentations 3:25</a>. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a>, followed by &#1500; dat., means to be good for one, i.e., beneficial. Some expositors (Gesenius, Rosenmller, Maurer, Ngelsbach) take &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; as a noun-form, substantive or adjective; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; is then also taken in the same way, and &#1493; - &#1493; as correlative: "it is good both to wait and be silent." But although there are analogous cases to support the view that &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; is a noun-form, the constant employment of &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; as an adverb quite prevents us from taking it as an adjective. Moreover, "to be silent for the help of the Lord," would be a strange expression, and we would rather expect "to be silent and wait for;" and finally, waiting and silence are so closely allied, that the disjunctive &#1493; - &#1493; et - et appears remarkable. We prefer, then, with Ewald (Gram. &#1431;235, a) and others, to take &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; as a verbal form, and that, too, in spite of the i in the jussive form of the Hiphil for &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, in the meaning of &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, to wait, tarry. "It is good that he (man) should wait, and in silence too (i.e., without complaining), for the help of the Lord." On the thought presented here, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>. Hence it is also good for man to bear a yoke in youth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a>), that he may exercise himself in calm waiting on the help of the Lord. In the present context the yoke is that of sufferings, and the time of youth is mentioned as the time of freshness and vigour, which render the bearing of burdens more easy. He who has learned in youth to bear sufferings, will not sink into despair should they come on him in old age. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, Theodotion has &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, which is also the reading of the Aldine edition of the lxx; and some codices have &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;. But this reading is evidently a correction, prompted by the thought that Jeremiah, who composed the Lamentations in his old age, had much suffering to endure from the time of his call to the prophetic office, in the earlier portion of his old age; nor is it much better than the inference of J. D. Michaelis, that Jeremiah composed this poem when a youth, on the occasion of King Josiah's death. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-28.htm">Lamentations 3:28-30</a>, the effect of experience by suffering is set forth, yet not in such a way that the verses are to be taken as still dependent on &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a> (Luther, Pareau, De Wette, Maurer, and Thenius): "that he should sit alone and be silent," etc. Such a combination is opposed to the independent character of each separate alphabetic strophe. Rather, the result of early experience in suffering and patience is developed in a cohortative form. The connection of thought is simply as follows: Since it is good for man that he should learn to endure suffering, let him sit still and bear it patiently, when God puts such a burden on him. Let him sit solitary, as becomes those in sorrow (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>), and be silent, without murmuring (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a>), when He lays a burden on him. There is no object to &#1504;&#1496;&#1500; expressly mentioned, but it is easily understood from the notion of the verb (if He lays anything on him), or from &#1506;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27</a> (if He lays a yoke on him). We are forbidden to consider the verbs as indicatives ("he sits alone and is silent;" Gerlach, Ngelsbach) by the apocopated form &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-29.htm">Lamentations 3:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30</a>, which shows that &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; and &#1497;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; are also cohortatives.</body></html>
