Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and niggardliness, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And ye have profaned - o (are habitually profaning it), in that ye say It was the daily result of their daily lives and acts.  "It is probable that the priests did not use such words, but that by their very deeds, they proclaimed this aloud: as in the, 'The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.' For in that he is seen to be a despiser, though he say it not in words, yet, by their very deeds and by the crookedness of their lives, they all but cry out, There is no God. For they who live as though God beheld not, and do all things recklessly and unholily, by their own deeds and works deny God. So they who are not earnest to preserve to the holy altar the reverence becoming to it, by the very things which they do, say,<p>The table of the Lord is despised - Not the "table of showbread," since it is so called in reference to the sacrifice offered thereon. Ezekiel had probably so called the altar, which he saw in his vision of the new temple. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-16.htm">Ezekiel 44:16</a>. It is what was before called "the altar;" an altar, in regard to the sacrifices offered to God; a "table," in regard to the food of the sacrifice therefrom received. Both names, "altar" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>. and "table" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>. being received in the New Testament, both were received in the early Church. For each represented one side of the great eucharistic action, as it is a Sacrifice and a sacrament. But the title "altar" was the earliest. <p>It may be here a different profaneness of the priests. They connived at the sin of the people in sacrificing the maimed animals which they brought, and yet, since they had their food from the sacrifices, and such animals are likely to have been neglected and ill-conditioned, they may very probably have complained of the poverty of their lot, and despised the whole service. For the words used, "its produce, the eating thereof is contemptible" belong to their portion, not to what was consumed by fire. With this agrees their cry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/malachi/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

They did not literally say, The Lord's table is contemptible; but their acts virtually said so. They did not act so as to lead the people to reverence, and to offer their best to the Lord on it. The people were poor, and put off God with the worst offerings. The priests let them do so, for fear of offending the people, and so losing all gains from them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But ye, </span> O priests, principally and first; the people next, by their examples; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">have profaned it; </span> used it as a common thing, and valued it at a strange undervalue, as if neither excellent nor useful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye say; </span> by your deportment you say so; perhaps you do not say so in words, this were two impudent indeed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The table of the Lord is polluted</span>; not a sacred thing, or to be revered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His meat; </span> either the meat which fell to the priests’ share, and was for them to live upon, this they despised; or else the portion which did belong to God himself, and was laid upon the altar; they were neither pleased with that the Lord did reserve to himself, nor with that he gave to them, but they found fault with both. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is contemptible; </span> a poor, sordid allowance, scarce fit for meaner persons and less service. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/malachi/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But ye have profaned it,....

"Fruit" and "meat" seem to signify one and the same thing, and design the fruit and meat of the altar; either that which belonged to the Lord, the fat and the blood, which were offered to him, and were reckoned contemptible; or that which fell to the share of the priests, which they thought mean and worthless. Cocceius interprets this of Christ the Branch of the Lord, and fruit of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a> whose meat it was to do the will of him that sent him, and was despised and rejected by the Jews; and which was the reason of God's casting them off, and taking in the Gentiles. <p>(o) "et verbum ejus", Pagninus, Munster; "sermo ejus, vel eorum", Vatablus; so Ben Melech. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/malachi/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> The table of the LORD <i>is</i> polluted; and the fruit thereof, <i>even</i> his meat, <i>is</i> contemptible.</span><p>(n) Both the priests and the people were infected with this error, that they did not regard what was offered: for they thought that God was as well content with the lean, as with the fat.

The expression, “the fruit thereof,” is very doubtful. The word occurs again (K’ri) <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-19.htm" title="I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the LORD; and I will heal him.">Isaiah 57:19</a>, but there the K’thibh is <span class="greekheb">נוב</span>.

But as this was owing to their own neglect, they were not likely to make it a subject of complaint <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zechariah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To this there is appended in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-5.htm">Zechariah 5:5-11</a> a new view, which exhibits the further fate of the sinners who have been separated from the congregation of the saints. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-5.htm">Zechariah 5:5</a>. "And the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, what is this that goeth out there? <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-6.htm">Zechariah 5:6</a>. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah going out. And He said, This is their aspect in all the land. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-7.htm">Zechariah 5:7</a>. And behold a disk of lead was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-8.htm">Zechariah 5:8</a>. And he said, This is wickedness; and he cast it into the midst of the ephah, and cast the leaden weight upon its mouth." With the disappearing of the previous vision, the angelus interpres had also vanished from the eyes of the prophet. After a short pause he comes out again, calls the prophet's attention to a new figure which emerges out of the cloud, and so comes within the range of vision (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;), and informs him with regard to it: "This is the ephah which goeth out." &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, to go out, in other words, to come to view. The ephah was the greatest measure of capacity which really existed among the Hebrews for dry goods, and was about the size of a cubic foot; for the cho&#772;mer, which contained ten ephahs, appears to have had only an ideal existence, viz., for the purpose of calculation. The meaning of this figure is indicated generally in the words &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501; &#1499;&#1489;, the meaning of which depends upon the interpretation to be given to &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1501;. The suffix of this word can only refer to the sinners mentioned before, viz., the thieves and perjurers; for it is contrary to the Hebrew usage to suppose that the words refer to the expression appended, &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, in the sense of "all those who are in the whole land" (Koehler). Consequently &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; does not mean the eye, but adspectus, appearance, or shape, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>.; and the words have this meaning: The ephah (bushel) is the shape, i.e., represents the figure displayed by the sinners in all the land, after the roll of the curse has gone forth over the land, i.e., it shows into what condition they have come through that anathema (Kliefoth). The point of comparison between the ephah and the state into which sinners have come in consequence of the curse, does not consist in the fact that the ephah is carried away, and the sinners likewise (Maurer), nor in the fact that the sin now reaches its full measure (Hofm., Hengstenberg); for "the carrying away of the sinners does not come into consideration yet, and there is nothing at all here about the sin becoming full." It is true that, according to what follows, sin sits in the ephah as a woman, but there is nothing to indicate that the ephah is completely filled by it, so that there is no further room in it; and this thought would be generally out of keeping here. The point of comparison is rather to be found in the explanation given by Kliefoth: "Just as in a bushel the separate grains are all collected together, so will the individual sinners over the whole earth be brought into a heap, when the curse of the end goes forth over the whole earth." We have no hesitation in appropriating this explanation, although we have not rendered &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; "the earth," inasmuch as at the final fulfilment of the vision the holy land will extend over all the earth. Immediately afterwards the prophet is shown still more clearly what is in the ephah. A covering of lead (kikka&#770;r, a circle, a rounding or a circular plate) rises up, or is lifted up, and then he sees a woman sitting in the ephah ('achath does not stand for the indefinite article, but is a numeral, the sinners brought into a heap appearing as a unity, i.e., as one living personality, instead of forming an atomistic heap of individuals). This woman, who had not come into the ephah now for the first time, but was already sitting there, and was only seen now that the lid was raised, is described by the angel as mirsha&#8219;ath, ungodliness, as being wickedness embodied, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a> this name is given to godless Jezebel. Thereupon he throws her into the ephah, out of which she had risen up, and shuts it with the leaden lid, to carry her away, as the following vision shows, out of the holy land. </body></html>
