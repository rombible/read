The rebuke contained in this verse is, according to this interpretation, very similar to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>. But the word “even,” which can only refer to “you” (Keil thinks differently), seems to us almost fatal to this interpretation. For we could only explain its use in the forced sense of: “Would that some one, among even you (who ought to be the promoters of God’s service), would (since His service has now become a mockery) shut, &c.” We are therefore inclined to retain the simple rendering of our venerable English Version. In that case, “even among you” (perhaps better, <span class= "ital">among even you</span>) would mean: “even among you whose duty it is, and chief pleasure it ought to be, to minister unto Me,” which, in that context, so far from being forced, would be most natural.<p><span class= "bld">For nought.</span>—Comp. the attitude of the priests in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;">1Samuel 2:13-16</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon the priests. Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, strongly obliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that they derided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle their convictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, who attend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, in effect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God's name in what they did. It is evident that these understood not the meaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb of God; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did not turn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and without understanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do it carelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; if we rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, we bring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions to lodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not a great affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? In order to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to do that which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from a right principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constant mercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and niggardliness, in our returns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established. Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer and praise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in which the true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, then this incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God's mercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin in future. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, though defective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and to his lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way, profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt for his worship.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is there even among you? - This stinginess in God's service was not confined to those offices which cost something, as the sacrifices. Not even services absolutely costless, which required only a little trouble, as that of closing the folding-doors of the temple or the outer court, or bringing the fire to consume the sacrifices, would they do without some special hire. All was mercenary and hireling service. Others have rendered it as a wish, "who is there among you!" i. e., would that there were one among you, who would close the doors altogether; so shall ye not kindle fire on Mine altar for nought, i. e., fruitlessly! But apart from the difficulty of the construction, it is not God's way to "quench the smouldering flax." He who bids, "Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost," accepts any imperfect service rather than none. He does not break off the last link, which binds man to Himself. Then, if or when God willed His service to surcease, He would do it Himself, as He did by the destruction of the temple before the captivity, or finally by the Romans. It would have been an ungodly act (such as was only done by Ahaz, perhaps the most ungodly king of Israel) <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24</a>, and one which especially called down His wrath <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-8.htm">2 Chronicles 29:8</a>, to close the doors, and therewith to break off all sacrifice. Manasseh carried the worship of false gods into the temple itself; Ahaz, as far as in him lay, abolished the service of God. A prophet of God could not express a wish, that pious Israelites (for it is presupposed that they would do this out of zeal for God's honor) should bring the service of God to an end.<p>He sums up with an entire rejection of them, present and future. "I have no pleasure in you;" it is a term of repudiation , sometimes of disgust  "neither will I accept an offering at your hands." He says not simply <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>, "your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto Me, but, I will not accept it." Such as they were, such they would be hereafter. God would not accept their sacrifices, but would replace them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/malachi/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Who &#8230; for naught&#8212;Not one even of the least priestly functions (as shutting the doors, or kindling a fire on the altar) would ye exercise without pay, therefore ye ought to fulfil them faithfully (1Co 9:13). Drusius and Maurer translate, "Would that there were absolutely some one of you who would shut the doors of the temple (that is, of the inner court, in which was the altar of burnt offerings), and that ye would not kindle fire on My altar in vain!" Better no sacrifices than vain ones (Isa 1:11-15). It was the duty of some of the priests to stand at the doors of the court of the altar of burnt offerings, and to have excluded blemished victims [Calvin].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/malachi/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some make this verse to be a kind of wish that there were some among them that would shut up the doors of the temple, and keep out such sacrifices and sacrificers; it would be less displeasing to God, it were better not done at all that so ill done, and so long as it is so ill done God can have no pleasure in it or them. Others make it a reproof of the priests upbraided for their profane contempt of God, and for their inexcusable negligence, while they are so well paid for all their service, be it ever so little and inconsiderable, as the lighting a fire on the altar, or shutting the doors of the temple: Inexcusable dishonesty, to receive large wages, and neglect your work! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I have no pleasure in you; </span> I cannot be pleased with such servants and services: or it is a meiosis, I am very greatly displeased with you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither will I accept an offering at your hand; </span> whilst you are thus profane and contemptuous, I will never accept your gifts, but reject you and them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/malachi/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?.... Either of the temple, as the Targum and Jarchi; for at each of the gates of the temple there were porters appointed in David's time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1</a> and who were paid for their service: or of the court, as Kimchi; the court of the priests where the offerings were brought. The words "for nought" are not, in the original text, at the end of this clause, but at the end of the next; and are by some referred to both; and by others restrained to the latter; and who give this as the sense of the words, "who is there", or "would there were any among you?" (f) any good man that would shut the doors of the temple, that so a man might not bring an abominable offering; intimating, that the priests or Levites however, who were porters, ought to shut the doors against such persons; and this way go Jarchi, Kimchi, and Abarbinel; to which the Chaldee paraphrase inclines; which is, <p>"who is there among you that will shut the door of the house of my sanctuary, that ye may not offer on mine altar an abominable sacrifice?'' <p>but the same writers, out of an ancient book called Torath Cohanim, observe a sense that agrees with ours, <p>"a man says to his friend, shut this door for me, he desires nothing for it; light me this candle, he asks no reward for it; but as for you, who is there among you that will shut my doors for nought? or kindle a fire on mine altar for nought? and how much less will ye do freely those things which used to be done for reward? therefore I have no pleasure in you.'' <p>There were four and twenty porters to open and shut the doors of the mountain of the house, or the temple, and the court of women in the daytime; six on the east side; four on the north; four on the south; at Asuppim two and two, four in all; four on the west, and two at Parbar (g): here they attended in the daytime, to keep the place pure and peaceable; and there seems to have been one over all the rest, whose business was to see that the doors at evening were shut by them: in the Misnah (h) we are told that Ben Geber was appointed over the shutting of the gates, i.e. of the temple; and at night there were four and twenty guards also that kept watch; the priests kept guard in three places; in the room "abtines", in the room "nitsots", and in the fire room; and one and twenty Levites; five at the five gates of the mountain of the house, or the compass of the temple; four at the four corners within; five at the five gates of the court; and four at its four corners without; one at the chamber "Corban"; one at the chamber over against the vail; and another behind the most holy place; and there was one that was called the man of the mountain of the house, who every night went through every ward with torches burning before him; and he had power to beat those he found asleep in their watch, and to burn their garments (i), to which the allusion is, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>, and these guards, as Bartenora (k) observes, were not on account of thieves and robbers, but for the honour of the house; and these, neither the one by day, nor the other by night, did their work for nought, but had a maintenance allowed them for it: <p>neither do ye kindle fire upon mine altar for nought: and this was done every morning, for though, as one of the Jewish writers says (l), fire came down, from heaven, it was ordered that they should bring of common fire; and there were three piles or rows of fire made every day upon the altar; the first was a large one, on which they offered the daily sacrifice, with the rest of the offerings; the second was on the side of it, a little one, from whence they took fire in the censer to burn incense every day; the third had no other use for it but to confirm the command concerning fire; as it is said, "the fire shall ever be burning", <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a> (m) and this fire was kindled to burn the sacrifices, the daily sacrifice, and other burnt offerings, for which they were paid out of the tithes, and other oblations; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a> this was an aggravation of their negligence and carelessness about what offerings were brought and sacrificed; seeing they were so well taken care of, and such a sufficient maintenance provided for them; so that they did not the least piece of service in the temple but they were fully rewarded for it; even not so much as to shut a door, or kindle a fire; and therefore it is no wonder their conduct should be resented, as follows: <p>I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts; neither in your persons, nor in your offerings: <p>neither will I accept an offering at your hand: the "minchah" or meat offering, any meat offering, particularly that which was offered morning and evening with the daily sacrifice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a> and it is sometimes used particularly for the evening meat offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-15.htm">2 Kings 16:15</a> or rather, "a wheat" or "bread offering"; since this offering was made of fine flour, with oil poured upon it, and frankincense put upon that, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a> hence mention is made of "incense" in the next verse <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>; and it was either baked in an oven, or fried in a pan; and either way, when it was brought to the priest, it was burnt on the altar, and was an offering by fire to the Lord, and of a sweet savour to him, when rightly performed; and was a figure of the sacrifice of Christ, which is of a sweet smelling savour to God; and this passage respects Gospel times, as appears from the following verse <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>, when Christ's sacrifice would be offered up, and so the oblation or meat offering made to cease, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a> hence God would not accept of it any more; or else because not rightly offered, as it was not when any leaven was mixed with it, or that and honey were burnt with it; signifying it should be offered with sincerity, and without hypocrisy, and other carnal lusts; and indeed no legal sacrifices were acceptable to God but such as were offered up in the faith of Christ, and with a view to his sacrifice, without trusting to, and depending upon, the outward offering, as hypocrites and carnal persons did: wherefore to this is opposed a pure "minchah" or meat offering in the next verse <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>; which designs spiritual sacrifices, such as are now offered up under the Gospel dispensation; when offering and sacrifice of a ceremonial kind God desires not; he will have no more offered up; he takes no pleasure in them; they are not acceptable to him, being superseded by the sacrifice of his Son, they were types of; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a> and agreeably to which passages the words may be understood, as expressing the Lord's rejection of legal sacrifices in general among the Jews, which he would have no longer continued than till the Messiah came; by whose sufferings and death the daily sacrifice was caused to cease, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a> when sacrifices of another kind should be offered up in the Gentile world, through every part of it, as in the following verse <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>. <p>(f)   "utinam vestrum aliquis", Gataker, Drusius.

Here not sacrifice in general, as many commentators suppose, because it would be unnatural to take the word in one sense in this verse, and in a different sense in the following, where it is confessedly used in its restricted signification. The term is applied technically to the offering of fine flour combined with off and frankincense, burnt on the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, etc.); though it is also occasionally used even of bloody sacrifices; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of Abel's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-17.htm">1 Samuel 2:17</a>). As liturgically employed, it denotes the unbloody offering. So in this verse we may note a kind of climax. God would not accept the victims sacrificed, no, nor even the meat offering, which was naturally pure and unpolluted, <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/zechariah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>. "And I lifted up my eyes again, and saw, and behold a flying roll. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-2.htm">Zechariah 5:2</a>. And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I see a flying roll; its length twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>. And he said to me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the whole land: for every one that stealeth will be cleansed away from this side, according to it; and every one that sweareth will be cleansed away from that side, according to it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>. I have caused it to go forth, is the saying of Jehovah of hosts, and it will come into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth by my name for deceit: and it will pass the night in the midst of his house, and consume both its beams and its stones." The person calling the prophet's attention to the vision, and interpreting it, is the angelus interpres. This is not specially mentioned here, as being obvious from what goes before. The roll (book-scroll, megilla&#770;h  equals  megillath se&#772;pher, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>) is seen flying over the earth unrolled, so that its length and breadth can be seen. The statement as to its size is not to be regarded as "an approximative estimate," so that the roll would be simply described as of considerable size (Koehler), but is unquestionably significant. It corresponds both to the size of the porch of Solomon's temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>), and also to the dimensions of the holy place in the tabernacle, which was twenty cubits long and ten cubits broad. Hengstenberg, Hofmann, and Umbreit, following the example of Kimchi, assume that the reference is to the porch of the temple, and suppose that the roll has the same dimensions as this porch, to indicate that the judgment is "a consequence of the theocracy" or was to issue from the sanctuary of Israel, where the people assembled before the Lord. But the porch of the temple was neither a symbol of the theocracy, nor the place where the people assembled before the Lord, but a mere architectural ornament, which had no significance whatever in relation to the worship. The people assembled before the Lord in the court, to have reconciliation made for them with God by sacrifice; or they entered the holy place in the person of their sanctified mediators, the priests, as cleansed from sin, there to appear before God and engage in His spotless worship. The dimensions of the roll are taken from the holy place of the tabernacle, just as in the previous vision the candlestick was the mosaic candlestick of the tabernacle. Through the similarity of the dimensions of the roll to those of the holy place in the tabernacle, there is no intention to indicate that the curse proceeds from the holy place of the tabernacle or of the temple; for the roll would have issued from the sanctuary, if it had been intended to indicate this. Moreover, the curse or judgment does indeed begin at the house of God, but it does not issue or come from the house of God. Kliefoth has pointed to the true meaning in the following explanation which he gives: "The fact that the writing, which brings the curse upon all the sinners of the earth, has the same dimensions as the tabernacle, signifies that the measure will be meted out according to the measure of the holy place;" and again, "the measure by which this curse upon sinners will be meted out, will be the measure of the holy place." With this measure would all sinners be measured, that they might be cut off from the congregation of the Lord, which appeared before God in the holy place.<p>The flight of the roll symbolized the going forth of the curse over the whole land. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is rendered by Hofmann, Neumann, and Kliefoth "the whole earth," because "it evidently signifies the whole earth in v. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-14.htm">Zechariah 4:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>" (Kliefoth). But these passages, in which the Lord of the whole earth is spoken of, do not prove anything in relation to our vision, in which &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is unmistakeably limited to the land of Canaan (Judah) by the antithesis in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>, "the land of Shinar." If the sinners who are smitten by the curse proceeding over &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; are to be carried into the land of Sinar, the former must be a definite land, and not the earth as the sum of all lands. It cannot be argued in opposition to this, that the sin of the land in which the true house of God and the true priesthood were, was wiped away by expiation, whereas the sin of the whole world would be brought into the land of judgment, when its measure was concluded by God; for this antithesis is foreign not only to this vision, but to the Scriptures universally. The Scriptures know nothing of any distribution or punishment of sins according to different lands, but simply according to the character of the sinners, viz., whether they are penitent or hardened. At the same time, the fact that &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; denotes the whole of the land of Israel, by no means proves that our vision either treats of the "carrying away of Israel into exile," which had already occurred (Ros.), or "sets before them a fresh carrying away into exile, and one still in the future" (Hengstenberg), or that on the coming of the millennial kingdom the sin and the sinners will be exterminated from the whole of the holy land, and the sin thrown back upon the rest of the earth, which is still under the power of the world (Hofmann). The vision certainly refers to the remote future of the kingdom of God; and therefore "the whole land" cannot be restricted to the extent and boundaries of Judaea or Palestine, but reaches as far as the spiritual Israel or church of Christ is spread over the earth; but there is no allusion in our vision to the millennial kingdom, and its establishment within the limits of the earthly Canaan. The curse falls upon all thieves and false swearers. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a> is defined more precisely in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>, as swearing in the name of Jehovah for deceit, and therefore refers to perjury in the broadest sense of the word, or to all abuse of the name of God for false, deceitful swearing. Thieves are mentioned for the sake of individualizing, as sinners against the second table of the decalogue; false swearers, as sinners against the first table. The repetition of &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492; points to this; for mizzeh, repeated in correlative clauses, signifies hinc et illinc, hence and thence, i.e., on one side and the other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a>), and can only refer here to the fact that the roll was written upon on both sides, so that it is to be taken in close connection with &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492;: "on this side ... and on that, according to it" (the roll), i.e., according to the curse written upon this side and that side of the roll. We have therefore to picture the roll to ourselves as having the curse against the thieves written upon the one side, and that against the perjurers upon the other. The supposition that mizzeh refers to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is precluded most decidedly, by the fact that mizzeh does not mean "thence," i.e., from the whole land, but when used adverbially of any place, invariably signifies "hence," and refers to the place where the speaker himself is standing. Moreover, the double use of mizzeh is at variance with any allusion to ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, as well as the fact that if it belonged to the verb, it would stand after &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1492;, whether before or after the verb. Niqqa&#770;h, the niphal, signifies here to be cleaned out, like &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). This is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a> thus: Jehovah causes the curse to go forth and enter into the house of the thief and perjurer, so that it will pass the night there, i.e., stay there (la&#770;neh third pers. perf. of lu&#772;n, from la&#770;na&#770;h, to be blunted, like zu&#770;reh in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>, and other verbal formations); it will not remain idle, however, but work therein, destroying both the house and sinners therein, so that beams and stones will be consumed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). The suffix in &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. Ges. 75, Anm. 19) refers to the house, of course including the inhabitants. The following nouns introduced with &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; are in explanatory apposition: both its beams and its stones. The roll therefore symbolizes the curse which will fall upon sinners throughout the whole land, consuming them with their houses, and thus sweeping them out of the nation of God. </body></html>
