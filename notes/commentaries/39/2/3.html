It is a covenant of life and peace; it assures all believers of all happiness, both in this world and in that to come. It is an honour to God's servants to be employed as his messengers. The priest's lips should not keep knowledge from his people, but keep it for them. The people are all concerned to know the will of the Lord. We must not only consult the written word, but desire instruction and advice from God's messengers, in the affairs of our souls. Ministers must exert themselves to the utmost for the conversion of sinners; and even among those called Israelites, there are many to be turned from iniquity. Those ministers, and those only, are likely to turn men from sin, who preach sound doctrine, and live holy lives according to the Scripture. Many departed from this way; thus they misled the people. Such as walk with God in peace and righteousness, and turn others from sin, honour God; he will honour them, while those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lo, I will rebuke the seed for your sake - o, i. e., that it should not grow. He who worketh by His sustaining will all the operations of nature, would at His will withhold them. Neither priests nor Levites cultivated the soil; yet, since the tithes were assigned to them, the diminution of the harvest affected them. The meal-offering too was a requisite part of the sacrifice.

Or, "the seed for you" (r); that is, for your sake, as Kimchi and Ben Melech explain it; meaning the seed they cast into the earth, which the Lord threatens to corrupt and destroy; so that it should not spring up again, and bring forth any increase: or, "rebuke" (s) it, as the word sometimes signifies; and so the Targum, <p>"behold, I will rebuke you in the increase, the fruit (son) of the seed.'' <p>The sense is the same; corrupting the seed being a rebuke to them; and rebuking the seed being a corruption of that, or hindering it from growing up. It is a threatening of a sore famine that should be in the Jewish nation; and which Cocceius thinks was that which happened in the days of Claudius Caesar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>. The Septuagint version renders it, "behold, I separate to you the shoulder"; the Arabic version, "the right hand", or arm; and the Vulgate Latin is, "behold, I will cast forth to you the arm"; the right shoulder of the sacrifice, which was given to the priests, and here threatened to be cast to them with indignation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a> but the former sense is best: <p>and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; that is, the dung of their beasts which were slain for sacrifice at their solemn feasts: so this word is used for a beast offered for sacrifice at a festival, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-27.htm">Psalm 118:27</a>. The sense is, that their sacrifices and solemn feasts were so far from being acceptable to God, that he would reject both them and their persons, and would cast the very dung of the creatures brought for sacrifice into their faces, and spread it over them: a phrase expressive of the utmost contempt of them, and of exposing them to the greatest shame and confusion for their sins. So the Targum, <p>"I will make manifest the shame of your sins upon your faces; and will cause to cease the magnificence of your feasts.'' <p>The Septuagint render it, the ventricle, or "maw"; which was given to the priests, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a> and in which the dung was contained: <p>and one shall take you away with it; with the dung spread upon them; they looking like a heap of dung, being covered with it, and had in no more account than that: or "to it" (t); that is, as Jarchi explains it, to the dung of the beasts of your sacrifices they shall carry you; or you shall be carried to it, that ye may be rejected and despised as that. Kimchi's note is <p>"the iniquity (you are guilty of) shall carry you to this contempt; measure for measure; you have despised me, and ye shall be despised:'' <p>or "with him", or "to himself" (u); meaning he, or it that shall take them away; either the wind or dung; or the enemy, as Aben Ezra interprets it; by whom the Romans may be designed, who took them away out of their own land, and carried them captive. According to the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, this is to be understood of God, who render the words, "I will take you together", or "with it". <p>(r) "propter vos", Munster, Drusius.

"And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold there came forth two women, and wind in their wings, and they had wings like a stork's wings; and they carried the ephah between earth and heaven. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-10.htm">Zechariah 5:10</a>. And I said to the angel that talked with me, Whither are these taking the ephah? <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>. And he said to me, To build it a dwelling in the land of Shinar: and it will be placed and set up there upon its stand." The meaning of this new scene may easily be discovered. The ephah with the woman in it is carried away between earth and heaven, i.e., through the air. Women carry it because there is a woman inside; and two women, because two persons are required to carry so large and heavy a measure, that they may lay hold of it on both sides (&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; with the &#1488; dropped; cf. Ges. 74, Anm. 4). These women have wings, because it passes through the air; and a stork's wings, because these birds have broad pinions, and not because the stork is a bird of passage or an unclean bird. The wings are filled with wind, that they may be able to carry their burden with greater velocity through the air. The women denote the instruments or powers employed by God to carry away the sinners out of His congregation, without any special allusion to this or the other historical nation. This is all that we have to seek for in these features, which only serve to give distinctness to the picture. But the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a> is significant: "to build it a house in the land of Shinar." The pronoun &#1500;&#1492; with the suffix softened instead of &#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4</a> (cf. Ewald, 247, d), refers grammatically to &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;; but so far as the sense is concerned, it refers to the woman sitting in the ephah, since a house is not built for a measure, but only for men to dwell in. This also applies to the feminine form &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1492;, and to the suffix in &#1502;&#1499;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;. The building of a house indicates that the woman is to dwell there permanently, as is still more clearly expressed in the second hemistich.  &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503;  refers to  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; , and is not to be taken hypothetically, in the sense of "as soon as the house shall be restored," but is a perfect with Vav consec.; and hu&#772;khan, the hophal of ku&#772;n, is not to be taken in the sense of restoring, but, in correspondence with mekhuna&#770;h, in the sense of establishing or building on firm foundations. Mekhuna&#770;h: the firmly established house. In this the woman of sin is brought to rest. The land in which the woman of sin carried away out of the holy land is permanently to dwell, is the land of Shinar. This name is not to be identified with Babel, so as to support the conclusion that it refers to a fresh removal of the people of Israel into exile; but according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-2.htm">Genesis 11:2</a>, Shinar is the land in which Nimrod founded the first empire, and where the human race built the tower of Babel which was to reach to the sky. The name is not to be taken geographically here as an epithet applied to Mesopotamia, but is a notional or real definition, which affirms that the ungodliness carried away out of the sphere of the people of God will have its permanent settlement in the sphere of the imperial power that is hostile to God. The double vision of this chapter, therefore, shows the separation of the wicked from the congregation of the Lord, and their banishment into and concentration within the ungodly kingdom of the world. This distinction and separation commenced with the coming of the Messiah, and runs through all the ages of the spread and development of the Christian church, until at the time of the end they will come more and more into outward manifestation; and the evil, having been sifted out by the judicial power of God and His Spirit, will form itself into a Babel of the last days, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a> and 39 clearly show, and attempt a last struggle with the kingdom of God, in which it will be overcome and destroyed by the last judgment. </body></html>
