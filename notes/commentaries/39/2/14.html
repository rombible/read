Because the LORD has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously: yet is she your companion, and the wife of your covenant.">Malachi 2:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is obvious from the whole context that divorce and foreign inter-marriage were becoming increasingly prevalent in Malachi’s time. The conditions in these respects were nearly similar to that prevailing in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. It is these sins which the Prophet is here vehemently condemning, and for which he threatens to cut off the transgressors out of the tents of Jacob, and to regard no more their offerings and simulated worship. They might cover ‘the altar of the Lord with tears,’ but the sacrifice which they laid upon it was polluted by the sins of their daily domestic life, and therefore was not ‘regarded by Him any more.’ Malachi is true to the prophetic spirit when he denounces a religion which has the form of godliness without its power over the practical life. But his sharp accusations have their edge turned by the question, ‘Wherefore?’ which again calls out from the Prophet’s lips a more sharply-pointed accusation, and a solemner warning that none should ‘deal treacherously against the wife of his youth,’ ‘for I hate putting away, saith the Lord.’ We may dismiss any further reference to the circumstances of the text, and regard it as but one instance of man’s way of treating the voice of God when it warns of the consequences of the sin of man. Looked at from such a point of view the words of our text bring before us God’s merciful threatenings and man’s incredulous rejection of them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. God’s merciful threatenings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The fact of sin affects God’s relation to and dealings with the sinner. It does not prevent the flowing forth of His love, which is not drawn out by anything in us, but wells up from the depths of His being, like the Jordan from its source at Dan, a broad stream gushing forth from the rock. But that love which is the outgoing of perfect moral purity must necessarily become perfect opposition to its own opposite in the sinfulness of man. The divine character is many-sided, and whilst ‘to the pure’ it ‘shows itself pure,’ it cannot but be that ‘to the froward’ it ‘will show itself froward.’ Man’s sin has for its most certain and dreadful consequence that, if we may so say, it forces God to present the stern side of His nature which hates evil. But not merely does sin thus modify the fact of the divine relation to men, but it throws men into opposition in which they can see only the darkness which dwells in the light of God. To the eye looking through a red tinted medium all things are red, and even the crystal sea before the throne is ‘a sea of glass mingled with fire.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No sin can stay our reception of a multitude of good gifts appealing to our hearts and revealing the patient love of our Father in heaven, but every sin draws after it as certainly as the shadow follows the substance, evil consequences which work themselves out on the large scale in nations and communities, and in the smaller spheres of individual life. And surely it is the voice of love and not of anger that comes to warn us of the death which is the wages of sin. It is not God who has ordained that ‘the soul that sinneth it shall die,’ but it is God who tells us so. The train is rushing full steam ahead to the broken bridge, and will crash down the gulph and be huddled, a hideous ruin, on the rocks; surely it is care for life that holds out the red flag of danger, and surely God is not to be blamed if in spite of the flag full speed is kept up and the crash comes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The miseries and sufferings which follow our sins are self-inflicted, and for the most part automatic. ‘Whatsoever a man soweth, that’-and not some other crop-’will he also reap.’ The wages of sin are paid in ready money; and it is as just to lay them at God’s door as it would be to charge Him with inflicting the disease which the dissolute man brings upon himself. It is no arbitrary appointment of God’s that ‘he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption’; nor is it His will acting as that of a jealous despot which makes it inevitably true that here and hereafter, ‘Every transgression and disobedience shall receive its just recompense of reward,’ and that to be parted from Him is death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If then we rightly understand the connection between sin and suffering, and the fact that the sorrows which are but the echoes of preceding sins have all a distinctly moral and restorative purpose, we are prepared rightly to estimate how tenderly the God who warns us against our sins by what men call threatenings loves us while He speaks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Man’s rejection of God’s merciful threatenings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is the great mystery and tragedy of life that men oppose themselves to God’s merciful warnings that all sin is a bitter, because it is an evil, thing. He has to lament, ‘I have smitten your children, and they have received no correction.’ The question ‘Wherefore?’ is asked in very various tones, but none of them has in it the accent of true conviction; and there is a whole world of difference between the lowly petition, ‘Show me wherefore Thou contendest with me,’ and the curt, self-complacent brushing aside of God’s merciful threatenings in the text. The last thing which most of us think of as the cause of our misfortunes is ourselves; and we resent as almost an insult the word, which if we were wise, we should welcome as the crowning proof of the seeking love of our Father in heaven. We are more obstinate and foolish than Balaam, who persisted in his purpose when the angel with the drawn sword in his hand would have barred his way, not to the tree of life, but to death. The awful mystery that a human will can, and the yet sadder mystery that it does, set itself against the divine, is never more unintelligible, never so stupid, and never so tragic as when God says, ‘Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?’ and we say, ‘Why need I die? I will not turn.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The ‘Wherefore?’ of our text is widely asked in the present day as an expression of utter bewilderment at the miseries of humanity, both in the wide area of this disordered world and in the narrower field of individual lives. There are whole schools of so-called political and social thinkers who have yet to learn that the one thing which the world and the individual need is not a change of conditions or environment, but redemption from sin. Man’s sorrows are but a symptom of his disease, and he is no more to be healed by tinkering with these than a fever-stricken patient can be restored to health by treating the blotches on his skin which tell of the disease that courses through his veins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But sometimes the question is more than an expression of bewilderment; it conceals an arraignment of God’s justice, or even a denial that there is a God at all. There are men among us who hesitate not to avow that the miseries of the world have rooted out of their minds a belief in Him; and who point to all the ills under which humanity staggers as conclusive against the ancient faith of a God of love. They, too, forget that that love is righteousness, and that if there be sin in the world and God above it, He must necessarily war against it and hate it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Our right response to God’s merciful threatenings is to ask this question in the right spirit. We are not wise if we turn a deaf ear to His warnings, or go on in a headlong course which He by His providences declared to be dangerous and fatal. We use them as wise men should, only if our ‘Wherefore?’ is asked in order to learn our evil, and having learned it, to purge our bosoms of the perilous stuff by confession and to seek pardon and victory in Christ. Then we shall ‘know the secret of the Lord’ which is ‘with them that fear Him’; and the mysteries that still hang over our own histories and the world’s destiny will have shining down upon them the steadfast light of that love which seeks to make men blessed by making them good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/malachi/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/2-14.htm" title="Yet you say, Why?

In contempt of the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away the wives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strange wives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight of others, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife; thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to be looked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. There is an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Man and wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace. Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have made another Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It was that the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wives must live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. The God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would be kept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sin begins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their families springs from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness of others, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisome to God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those who think God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves.

What had they to do with their wives' womanly tears? He who knows the hearts of all was Himself the witness between them and the wife of youth of each; her to whom, in the first freshness of life and their young hearts, each had plighted his troth having been entrusted by her with her earthy all. <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49-50</a>. "The Lord," said even Laban, when parting from his daughters, "watch between me and thee, when we are absent, the one from the other; if thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and thee."<p>And he dealt treacherously against her - , violating his own faith and her trusting love, which she had given once for all, and could not now retract. "And she is thy companion;" she has been another self, the companion of thy life, sharing thy sorrows, joys, hopes, fears, interests; different in strength, yet in all, good and ill, sickness and health, thy associate and companion; the help meet for the husband and provided for him by God in Paradise; and above all, "the wife of thy covenant," to whom thou didst pledge thyself before God. These are so many aggravations of their sin. She was the wife of their youth, of their covenant, their companion; and God was the Witness and Sanctifier of their union. Marriage was instituted and consecrated by God in Paradise. Man was to leave father and mother (if so be), but to cleave to his wife indissolubly. For they were to be <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>, "no more twain, but one flesh." Hence, as a remnant of Paradise, even the pagan knew of marriage, as a religious act, guarded by religious sanctions. Among God's people, marriage was a <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a> "covenant of their God." To that original institution of marriage he seems to refer in the following: <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/malachi/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

What is the meaning of the women covering the altar with tears? as if they knew not what was the reason of it, when they were so notoriously guilty of breach of covenant with them; which is an instance of their impudence, as Abarbinel observes: or, "if ye say, wherefore?" as the Targum and Kimchi interpret the words; should you say, what is the reason why the Lord will not regard nor receive our offerings? the answer is ready, <p>Because the Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth: when espoused together in their youthful days, the Lord was present at that solemn contract, and saw the obligations they were laid under to each other, and he was called upon by both parties to be a witness of the same; and at the present time he was a witness how agreeably the wives of the Israelites had behaved towards their husbands, and how treacherously they had acted towards them; he saw and knew, that, whatever pretensions they made, they did not love them, nor behave as they should towards them; and therefore had just cause of complaint against them, and must be a witness for the one, and against the other: this sin of hating and divorcing their wives, or of marrying others besides them, which prevailed much in our Lord's time, is particularly mentioned, though they were guilty of many other sins, as a reason of the Lord's not accepting their offerings: the aggravations of it are, that they had broken a contract God was witness to, and dealt injuriously with wives they had espoused in the days of their youth; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>, <p>against whom thou hast dealt treacherously; by divorce or polygamy: the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "whom thou hast despised": and the Septuagint and Arabic versions, "whom thou hast left"; divorced and took others, which arose from hatred and contempt of their former: other aggravations follow: <p>yet is she thy companion; or, "and she is", or "though she is thy companion" (c): has been so in time past, and ought to be so still, and so accounted: the wife is a part of a man's self, is one flesh with him; a partaker of what he has; a partner with him in prosperity and adversity; a companion in life, civil and religious, and ought to remain so till death part them; for, whom God has put together, let no man put asunder: <p>and the wife of thy covenant; wherefore either to divorce her, or marry another, was a breach of covenant; for by "covenant" is not meant the covenant of God made with the people of Israel, in which they both were; but the covenant of marriage made between them, and which was broken by such practices. <p>(c)  "et ipsa est socia tua", Montanus, Drusius, Burkius; "quum sit socia tua", Pagninus, Munster, Tigurine version, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/malachi/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yet ye say, <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> Wherefore?

The transaction is the following: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-9.htm">Zechariah 6:9</a>. "And the word of Jehovah came to me thus: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a>. Take of the people of the captivity, of Cheldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedahyah, and go thou the same day, go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they have come from Babel; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>. And take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jozadak the high priest." By the introduction, "The word of the Lord came to me," the following transaction is introduced as a procedure of symbolical importance. It is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> that messengers had come to Jerusalem from the Israelites who had been left behind in Babel, to offer presents of silver and gold, probably for supporting the erection of the temple, and had gone to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. The prophet is to go to them, and to take silver and gold from them, to have a crown made for Joshua the high priest. The construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> is somewhat broad and dragging. The object is wanting to the inf. absol. &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495;, which is used instead of the imperative; and the sentence which has been begun is interrupted by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, so that the verb which stands at the head is resumed in the &#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>, and the sentence finished by the introduction of the object. This view is the simplest one. For it is still more impracticable to take &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495; in an absolute sense, and either supply the object from the context, or force it out by alterations of the text (Hitzig). If, for example, we were to supply as the object, "that which they are bringing," this meaning would result: "accept what they are bringing, do not refuse it," without there being any ground for the assumption that there had been any unwillingness to accept the presents. The alteration of &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; into &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, "my jewels," is destitute of any critical support, and &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; is defended against critical caprice by the &#1500;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>. Nor can &#1502;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; be taken as the object to &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495;, "take (some) from the emigration," because this thought requires &#1502;&#1503;, and is irreconcilable with &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, "from with." Haggo&#772;la&#770;h, lit., the wandering into exile, then those who belong to the wandering, or to the exiled, not merely those who are still in exile, but very frequently also those who have returned from exile.

This is implied in the words &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1489;, whither they have come from Babel. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is an accus. loci, pointing back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;. We are not warranted in interpreting the names of these men symbolically or typically, either by the circumstance that the names have an appellative meaning, like all proper names in Hebrew, or by the fact that Cheldai is written Che&#772;lem in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>, and that instead of Josiah we have there apparently che&#772;n. For che&#772;n is not a proper name (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>), and che&#772;lem, i.e., strength, is not materially different from Cheldai, i.e., the enduring one; so that it is only a variation of the name, such as we often meet with. The definition "on that day" can only point back to the day mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm">Zechariah 1:7</a>, on which Zechariah saw the night-visions, so that it defines the chronological connection between this symbolical transaction and those night-visions. For, with the explanation given by C. B. Michaelis, "die isto quo scil. facere debes quae nunc mando," the definition of the time is unmeaning. If God had defined the day more precisely to the prophet in the vision, the prophet would have recorded it. Zechariah is to have given to him as much of the silver and gold which they have brought with them as is required to make &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th. The plural &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th does indeed apparently point to at least two crowns, say a silver and a golden one, as C. B. Michaelis and Hitzig suppose. But what follows cannot be made to harmonize with this. The prophet is to put the &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th upon Joshua's head. But you do not put two or more crowns upon the head of one man; and the indifference with which Ewald, Hitzig, and Bunsen interpolate the words &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;&#1500; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; after &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, without the smallest critical authority, is condemned by the fact that in what follows only one wearer of a crown is spoken of, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a>, according to the correct interpretation, there is no "sharp distinction made between the priest and the Messiah." The plural &#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ro&#772;th denotes here one single splendid crown, consisting of several gold and silver twists wound together, or rising one above another, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>, and just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;) Christ is said to wear, not many separate diadems, but a crown consisting of several diadems twisted together, as the insignia of His regal dignity. </body></html>
