In <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a>, he calls the priest the <span class= "ital">angel</span> or <span class= "ital">messenger</span> of the LORD. There can be little doubt that he is influenced in his choice of the term by his own personal name (see <span class= "ital">Introd.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> This “messenger,” by the distinct reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm" title="The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.">Isaiah 40:3</a>, contained in the words, “and he shall prepare,” &c., is evidently the same as he whom [the deutero-] Isaiah prophetically heard crying, “In the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.” Moreover, from the nature of his mission, he is proved to be identical with the “Elijah” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-3.htm" title="And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 4:3</a>.

Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.">Matthew 17:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The Lord.</span>—This word “Lord” occurs eight times with the definite article, but always, except here, with the name of God following it: viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-17.htm" title="Three items in the year all your males shall appear before the LORD God.">Exodus 23:17</a>, followed by “Jehovah;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-23.htm" title="Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.">Exodus 34:23</a>, by “Jehovah, the God of Israel;” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm" title="Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, does take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-33.htm" title="Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.">Isaiah 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-4.htm" title="And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, said the Lord, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 19:4</a>, by “Jehovah Zebaoth;” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm" title="Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.">Isaiah 10:16</a>, by “the Lord of Zebaoth.” And here, as elsewhere, it must mean God Himself, because He is said to come “to <span class= "ital">his</span> temple,” and because He is said to be He “whom ye seek:” <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, “the God of judgment” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm" title="You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, Wherein have we wearied him? When you say, Every one that does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?">Malachi 2:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, “namely,” for so the Hebrew conjunction “and” is frequently used: <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-12.htm" title="And you shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.">Exodus 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm" title="Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.

Identified as He is here with “the Lord,” He can be no other than the Son of God, who was manifested in the flesh as the Messiah. In the word “covenant” there is, perhaps, some reference to the “new covenant” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>), but the meaning of the word must not be limited to this.<p><span class= "bld">Delight in.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">desire.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/malachi/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Malachi<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE LAST WORD OF PROPHECY<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-12.htm" title="And all nations shall call you blessed: for you shall be a delightsome land, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:12</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Deep obscurity surrounds the person of this last of the prophets. It is questioned whether Malachi is a proper name at all. It is the Hebrew word rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a> of our passage ‘My messenger,’ and this has led many authorities to contend that the prophecy is in fact anonymous, the name being only a designation of office. Whether this is so or not, the name, if it is a name, is all that we know about him. The tenor of his prophecy shows that he lived after the restoration of the Temple and its worship, and the sins which he castigates are substantially those with which Ezra and Nehemiah had to fight. One ancient Jewish authority asserts that he was Ezra; but the statement has no confirmation, and if it had been correct, we should not have expected that such an author would have been anonymous. This dim figure, then, is the last of the mighty line of prophets, and gives strong utterance to the ‘hope of Israel’! One clear voice, coming from we scarcely know whose lips, proclaims for the last time, ‘He comes! He comes!’ and then all is silence for four hundred years. Modern critics, indeed, hold that the bulk of the Psalter is of later date; but that contention has much to do before it can be regarded as established.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The first point worthy of notice in this passage, then, is the concentration, in this last prophetic utterance, of that element of forward-looking expectancy which marked all the earlier revelation. From the beginning, the selectest spirits in Israel had set their faces and pointed their fingers to a great future, which gathered distinctness as the ages rolled, and culminated in the King from David’s line, of whom many psalms sung, and in the suffering Servant of the Lord, who shines out from the pages of the second part of Isaiah’s prophecy. This Messianic hope runs through all the Old Testament, like a broadening river. ‘They that went before cried, Hosanna! Blessed is He that cometh.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That hope gives unity to the Old Testament, whatever criticism may have to teach about the process of its production. The most important thing about the book is that one purpose informs it all; and the student who misses the truth that ‘the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy’ has a less accurate conception of the meaning and inter-relations of the Old Testament than the unlearned who has accepted that great truth. We should be willing to learn all that modern scholarship has to teach about the course of revelation. But we should take care that the new knowledge does not darken the old certainty that the prophets ‘testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and of the glory that should follow,’ Here, at the very end, stands Malachi, reiterating the assurance which had come down through the centuries. The prophets, as it were, had lit a beacon which flamed through the darkness. Hand after hand had flung new fuel on it when it burned low. It had lighted up many a stormy night of exile and distress. Now we can dimly see one more, the last of his order, casting his brand on the fire, which leaps up again; and then he too passes into the darkness, but the beacon burns on.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The next point to note is the clear prophecy of a forerunner. ‘My messenger’ is to come, and to ‘prepare the way before Me.’ Isaiah had heard a voice calling, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord,’ and Malachi quotes his words, and ascribes the same office to the ‘messenger.’ In the last verses of his prophecy he calls this messenger ‘Elijah the prophet.’ Here, then, we have a remarkable instance of a historical detail set forth in prophecy. The coming of the Lord is to be immediately preceded by the appearance of a prophet, whose function is to effect a moral and religious reformation, which shall prepare a path for Him. This is no vague ideal, but definite announcement of a definite fact, to be realised in a historical personality. How came this half-anonymous Jew, four hundred years beforehand, to hit upon the fact that the next prophet in Israel would herald the immediate coming of the Lord? There ought to be but one answer possible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Another point to note is the peculiar relation between Jehovah and Him who comes. Emphatically and broadly it is declared that Jehovah Himself ‘shall suddenly come to His temple’; and then the prophecy immediately passes on to speak of the coming of ‘the Messenger of the covenant,’ and dwells for a time exclusively on his work of purifying; and then again it glides, without conscious breach of continuity or mark of transition, into, ‘And <span class="ital">I</span> will come near to you in judgment.’ A mysterious relationship of oneness and yet distinctness is here shadowed, of which the solution is only found in the Christian truth that the Word, which was Grod, and was in the beginning with God, became flesh, and that in Him Jehovah in very deed tabernacled among men. The expression ‘the Messenger {or Angel} of the covenant’ is connected with the remarkable representations in other parts of the Old Testament, of ‘the Angel of Jehovah,’ in whom many commentators recognise a pre-incarnate manifestation of the eternal Word. That ‘Angel’ had redeemed Israel from Egypt, had led them through the desert, had been the ‘Captain of the Lord’s host.’ The name of Jehovah was ‘in Him.’ He it is whose coming is here prophesied, and in His coming Jehovah comes to His temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We next note the aspect of the coming which is prominent here. Not the kingly, nor the redemptive, but the judicial, is uppermost. With keen irony the Prophet contrasts the professed eagerness of the people for the appearance of Jehovah and their shrinking terror when He does come. He is ‘the Lord whom ye seek’; the Messenger of the covenant is He ‘whom ye delight in.’ But all that superficial and partially insincere longing will turn into dread and unwillingness to abide His scrutiny. The images of the refiner’s fire and the fullers’ soap imply painful processes, of which the intention is to burn out the dross and beat out the filth. It sounds like a prolongation of Malachi’s voice when John the Baptist peals out his herald cry of one whose ‘fan was in His hand,’ and who should plunge men into a fiery baptism, and consume with fire that destroyed what would not submit to be cast into the fire that cleansed. Nor should we forget that our Lord has said, ‘For judgment am I come into the world.’ He came to ‘purify’; but if men would not let Him do what He came for, He could not but be their bane instead of their blessing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The stone is laid. If we build on it, it is a sure foundation; if we stumble over it, we are broken. The double aspect and effect of the gospel, which was meant only to have the single operation of blessing, are clearly set forth in this prophecy, which first promises purging from sin, so that not only the ‘sons of Levi’ shall offer in righteousness, but that the ‘offerings of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasant,’ and then passes immediately to foretell that God will come in judgment and witness against evil-doers. Judgment is the shadow of salvation, and constantly attends on it. Neither Malachi nor the Baptist gives a complete view of Messiah’s work, but still less do they give an erroneous one; for the central portion of both prophecies is His purifying energy which both liken to cleansing fire.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That real and inward cleansing is the great work of Christ. It was wrought on as many of His contemporaries as believed on Him, and for such as did not He was a swift Witness against them. Nor are we to forget that the prophecy is not exhausted yet; for there remains another ‘day of His coming’ for judgment. The prophets did not see the perspective of the future, and often bring together events widely separated in time, just as, to a spectator on a mountain, distances between points far away towards the horizon are not measurable. We have to allow for foreshortening.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This blending of events historically widely apart is to be kept in view in interpreting Malachi’s prediction that the coming would result in Judah’s and Israel’s offerings being ‘pleasant unto the Lord as in former years.’ That prediction is not yet fulfilled, whether we regard the name of Israel and the relation expressed in it as having passed over to the Christian Church, or whether we look forward to that bringing in of all Israel which Paul says will be as ‘life from the dead.’ But by slow degrees it is being fulfilled, and by Christ men are being led to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The more directly Messianic part of this prophecy is closed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm" title="For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed.">Malachi 3:6</a> by a great saying, which at once gives the reason for the coming and for its severe aspect of witness against sin. The unchangeableness of God, which is declared in His very name, guarantees the continued existence of Israel. As Paul says in regard to the same subject, ‘The calling of God is without change of purpose’ {on His part}. But it is as impossible that God should leave them to their sins, which would destroy them, as that He should Himself consume them. Therefore He will surely come; and coming, will deliver from evil. But they who refuse to be so delivered will forfeit that title and the pledge of preservation which it implies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A new paragraph begins with <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-7.htm" title="Even from the days of your fathers you are gone away from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, said the LORD of hosts. But you said, Wherein shall we return?">Malachi 3:7</a>, which is not closely connected with the promises preceding. It recurs to the prevailing tone of Malachi, the rebuke of negligence in attending to the legal obligations of worship. That negligence is declared to be a reason for God’s withdrawal from them. But the ‘return,’ which is promised on condition of their renewed obedience, can scarcely be identified with the coming just foretold. That coming was to bring about offerings of righteousness which should be pleasant to the Lord. This section {<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-7.htm" title="Even from the days of your fathers you are gone away from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, said the LORD of hosts. But you said, Wherein shall we return?">Malachi 3:7</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-12.htm" title="And all nations shall call you blessed: for you shall be a delightsome land, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:12</a>} promises blessings as results of such offerings, and a ‘return’ of Jehovah to His people contingent upon their return to Him. If the two sections of this passage are taken as closely connected, this one must describe the consequences of the coming. But, more probably, this accusation of negligence and promise of blessing on a change of conduct are independent of the previous verses. We, however, may fairly take them as exhibiting the obligations of those who have received that great gift of purifying from Jesus Christ, and are thereby consecrated as His priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The key-word of the Christian life is ‘sacrifice’-surrender, and that to God. That is to be stamped on the inmost selves, and by the act of the will, on the body as well. ‘Yield yourselves to God, and your members as instruments of righteousness to Him.’ It is to be written on possessions. Malachi necessarily keeps within the limits of the sacrificial system, but his impetuous eloquence hits us no less. It is still possible to ‘rob God.’ We do so when we keep anything as our own, and use it at our own will, for our own purposes. Only when we recognise His ownership of ourselves, and consequently of all that we call ‘ours,’ do we give Him His due. All the slave’s chattels belong to the owner to whom he belongs. Such thorough-going surrender is the secret of thorough possession. The true way to enjoy worldly goods is to give them to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The lattices of heaven are opened, not to pour down, as of old, fiery destruction, but to make way for the gentle descent of God’s blessing, which will more than fill every vessel set to receive it. This is the universal law, not always fulfilled in increase of outward goods, but in the better riches of communion and of larger possession in God Himself. He suffers no man to be His creditor, but more than returns our gifts, as legends tell of some peasant who brought his king a poor tribute of fruits of his fields, and went away from the presence-chamber with a jewel in his hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/malachi/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, </span>&c. — To silence the cavils of unbelievers, spoken of in the last verse of the preceding chapter, the prophet here foretels the coming of the Messiah, who should set things in order; and of his harbinger, who should prepare men for his reception. <span class="ital">I will send my messenger — </span>It is God who speaks here, for John the Baptist, who is here intended, was God’s messenger, and had his commission from heaven and not of men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/21-25.htm" title="The baptism of John, from where was it? from heaven, or of men?

The messenger here spoken of as sent to prepare the way before the Lord, who is described as <span class="ital">coming immediately </span>after this his forerunner, is represented in Isaiah as <span class="ital">preparing the way of the Lord, </span>who is spoken of as <span class="ital">coming, </span>and <span class="ital">his glory </span>as just ready <span class="ital">to be revealed, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts....">Malachi 3:5-9</a>. Both passages, according to the evangelists, were intended of John the Baptist, and indeed are applicable to no other person whatever. He is promised under the name of Elias in the following chapter, whom all the Jews, both ancient and modern, expected should come as the forerunner of the Messiah. This <span class="ital">messenger, </span>or prophet, (see the note on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a>,) here represented as the Lord’s harbinger, was to be as much inferior to the Lord himself, as servants are to a great person, of whose arrival they give notice. This John himself often confessed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-26.htm" title="John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;">John 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-28.htm" title="You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.">John 3:28</a>; and so much appears by the following words. Instead of the reading here, which is the literal translation of the Hebrew, we read in three places of the New Testament, (see the margin,) <span class="ital">I send my messenger before thy face to prepare thy way before thee, </span>namely, before the Messiah, to prepare his way before him; the Messiah acting in the name of his Father, <span class="ital">the Father being in him and he in the Father, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works....">John 14:10-11</a>. John prepared the way of Christ by calling men to the practice of those duties which would qualify them for the reception of the blessings of the Messiah’s kingdom; and by taking them off from all confidence in their relation to Abraham as their father, which they thought would ensure the favour of God to them without a Saviour; and by giving them notice that the Messiah was now at hand, and so raising their expectation of him that they might readily enter into his measures for the setting up of his kingdom in the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And the Lord, whom ye seek — </span>That promised Lord or Shiloh, of whom you have such great expectations, and whose coming you so much desire; and who, if you obey him, will bring the greatest good to your state, and will also make foreign nations partakers of your blessings; <span class="ital">shall suddenly come — </span>That is, <span class="ital">soon </span>after the messenger, or <span class="ital">unawares, </span>as Christ’s first coming was, and second will be; <span class="ital">to his temple </span>— The second temple at Jerusalem, lately built by Zerubbabel and Joshua. All the Jews, before the birth of Christ, firmly believed that the Messiah was to come into that very temple, according to what the Prophet Haggai had expressly declared, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-8.htm" title="The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:8</a>.

By his mediation this covenant is procured and established; and though he is the <span class="ital">prince of the covenant, </span>as some read the clause here, yet he condescended to be the <span class="ital">messenger </span>of it, that we might, upon his word, have the fullest assurance of God’s goodwill to man. <span class="ital">Whom ye delight in</span> — Whose coming ye so much desire, the time of it being the subject of your earnest inquiry and diligent search, and the expectation of it your comfort and delight. <span class="ital">Behold, he shall come — </span>The promise is repeated, and that in the name of <span class="ital">the Lord of hosts, </span>to give the fullest assurance of its accomplishment. There were few among the Jews who did not please themselves to think of the Messiah’s coming, though from various motives; the pious among them doubtless expecting spiritual blessings, such as a further revelation of God’s will, and larger communications of his grace and Spirit; but the great bulk of the nation looking for mere worldly advantages under a temporal kingdom, which they expected he would set up.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The first words of this chapter seem an answer to the scoffers of those days. Here is a prophecy of the appearing of John the Baptist. He is Christ's harbinger. He shall prepare the way before him, by calling men to repentance. The Messiah had been long called, He that should come, and now shortly he will come. He is the Messenger of the covenant. Those who seek Jesus, shall find pleasure in him, often when not looked for. The Lord Jesus, prepares the sinner's heart to be his temple, by the ministry of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, and he enters it as the Messenger of peace and consolation. No hypocrite or formalist can endure his doctrine, or stand before his tribunal. Christ came to distinguish men, to separate between the precious and the vile. He shall sit as a Refiner. Christ, by his gospel, shall purify and reform his church, and by his Spirit working with it, shall regenerate and cleanse souls. He will take away the dross found in them. He will separate their corruptions, which render their faculties worthless and useless. The believer needs not fear the fiery trial of afflictions and temptations, by which the Saviour refines his gold. He will take care it is not more intense or longer than is needful for his good; and this trial will end far otherwise than that of the wicked. Christ will, by interceding for them, make them accepted. Where no fear of God is, no good is to be expected. Evil pursues sinners. God is unchangeable. And though the sentence against evil works be not executed speedily, yet it will be executed; the Lord is as much an enemy to sin as ever. We may all apply this to ourselves. Because we have to do with a God that changes not, therefore it is that we are not consumed; because his compassions fail not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God answers their complaints of the absence of His judgments, that they would come, but would include those also who clamored for them. For no one who knew his own sinfulness would call for the judgment of God, as being himself, chief of sinners. Augustine pictures one saying to God, "Take away the ungodly man," and that God answers, "Which?"<p>Behold, I send My messenger before My face, and he shall prepare My way before Me - they, then, were not prepared for His Coming, for whom they clamored. The messenger is the same whom Isaiah had foretold, whose words Malachi uses  <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> : "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straiqht in the desert a highway for our God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>. Thou, child," was the prophecy on John the Immerser's birth, "shalt be called the prophet of the Highest, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His way, to give knowledge of salvation unto His people, for the remission of their sins." Repentance was to be the preparation for the kingdom of Christ, the Messiah, for whom they looked so impatiently.<p>He who speaks, is He who should come, God the Son. For it was before Him Who came and dwelt among us, that the way was to be prepared. He speaks here in His divine nature, as the Lord Who should send, and Who should Himself come in our flesh. In the Gospel, when He was come in the flesh, He speaks not of His own Person but of the Father, since  "indivisible are the operations of the Trinity, and what the One doth, the other Two do, since the Three are of one nature, power and operation." Whence Christ, in order to give no excuse to the Jews to speak against Him before the time, refers it, as He does His life <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-57.htm">John 6:57</a>.

Thus, John says <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-41.htm">John 12:41</a>. Isaiah spoke of the unbelief of the Jews, when he "saw" the "glory" of God the Son "and spake of Him," and Paul says <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-25.htm">Acts 28:25</a>. that the "Holy Spirit spake" then "by" him.<p>And he shall prepare the way before Meo - "The same is God's way here, and Christ's there, an evident proof that Christ is one God with the Father, and that, in Christ, God came and was manifest in the flesh." The prophets and all who turned men to righteousness, or who retained the knowledge of the truth or of righteousness or of God in the world, did, in their degree, prepare the way for Christ. But John was His immediate forerunner "before His Face," the herald of His immediate approach; from where he is called  "the end of the law, and the beginning of the Gospel,"  "the lamp before the Light, the voice before the Word, the mediator between the Old and the New Testament;"  "the link of the law and of grace; a new morning star; a ray, before the true Sun should burst forth," the end of night, the beginning of day.<p>And the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple - He, Whose Coming they sought for, was Almighty God, "the God of Judgment."  He who should come, was "the Lord," again Almighty God, since, in usage too, none else is called "the Lord,"  as none else can be. The temple also, to which He was to come, the temple of God, is His own. "The messenger, or the Angel of the covenant," plainly, even from the parallelism, is the same as "the Lord." It was "one," for whom they looked; one, of whose absence they complained; <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>, "where is the God of judgment?" one, who should come to His temple , one whose coming they sought and prepared "to have pleasure in;"  one, of whom it is repeated, "lo, He cometh,"  one, in the day of whose coming, at whose appearing, it was asked, "who shall stand?"  "All Christian interpreters are agreed that this Lord is Christ <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>, whom God hath made both Lord and Christ, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>. Who is Lord over all; by whom all things were made, are sustained and governed; Who is (as the root of the word  implies) the basis and foundation, not of any private family, tribe or kingdom, but of all; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>. by whom are all things and we by Him: and whose we are also by right of redemption; and so He is <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>. Lord of lords and King of kings, deservedly called the Lord." As then the special presence of God was often indicated in connection with "the Angel of the Lord," so, here, He who was to come was entitled the Angel or messenger of the covenant, as God also calls Him the covenant itself.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, "I will give Thee for a covenant of the people, a light of the Gentiles." He it was <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, "the Angel of His presence," who saved His former people, in whom His "Name was," and who, by the prerogative of God, would <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>, "not pardon their transgressions." He should be <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>, "the Mediator of the new and better covenant" which is promised <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32-33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-9.htm">Hebrews 8:9</a>, "not according to the covenant, that I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt," which "My covenant they broke, although I was a husband unto them, saith the Lord; but this shall be the covenant, that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God and they shall be My people."<p>Whom ye seek, are seeking, whom ye delight in - , i. e., profess so to do; "He will come," but will be very different from Him whom ye look for, an Avenger on your enemies. Judgment will come, but it will begin with yourselves.<p>Shall suddenly come - o "unawares, when men should not think of them; whence perhaps it is that the Jews reckon the Messiah among what shall come unawares."  As, it is here said of His first Coming, so it is said of His second Coming (which may be comprehended under this here spoken of) that except they diligently watch for it <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/21-35.htm">Luke 21:35</a>, "it shall come upon them unawares <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-36.htm">Mark 13:36</a>. suddenly <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>. in such an hour as they think not."  "The Lord of glory always comes, like a thief in the night, to those who sleep in their sins."<p>Lo, He will come - : he insists again and calls their minds to that Coming, certain, swift, new, wonderful, on which all eyes should be set, but His coming would be a sifting-time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Mal 3:1-18. Messiah's Coming, Preceded by His Forerunner, to Punish the Guilty for Various Sins, and to Reward Those Who Fear God.<p>1. Behold&#8212;Calling especial attention to the momentous truths which follow. Ye unbelievingly ask, Where is the God of judgment (Mal 2:7)? "Behold," therefore, "I send," &c. Your unbelief will not prevent My keeping My covenant, and bringing to pass in due time that which ye say will never be fulfilled.<p>I will send &#8230; he shall come&#8212;The Father sends the Son: the Son comes. Proving the distinctness of personality between the Father and the Son.<p>my messenger&#8212;John the Baptist; as Mt 3:3; 11:10; Mr 1:2, 3; Lu 1:76; 3:4; 7:26, 27; Joh 1:23, prove. This passage of Malachi evidently rests on that of Isaiah his predecessor (Isa 40:3-5). Perhaps also, as Hengstenberg thinks, "messenger" includes the long line of prophets headed by Elijah (whence his name is put in Mal 4:5 as a representative name), and terminating in John, the last and greatest of the prophets (Mt 11:9-11). John as the representative prophet (the forerunner of Messiah the representative God-man) gathered in himself all the scattered lineaments of previous prophecy (hence Christ terms him "much more than a prophet," Lu 7:26), reproducing all its awful and yet inspiriting utterances: his coarse garb, like that of the old prophets, being a visible exhortation to repentance; the wilderness in which he preached symbolizing the lifeless, barren state of the Jews at that time, politically and spiritually; his topics sin, repentance, and salvation, presenting for the last time the condensed epitome of all previous teachings of God by His prophets; so that he is called pre-eminently God's "messenger." Hence the oldest and true reading of Mr 1:2 is, "as it is written in Isaiah the prophet"; the difficulty of which is, How can the prophecy of Malachi be referred to Isaiah? The explanation is: the passage in Malachi rests on that in Isa 40:3, and therefore the original source of the prophecy is referred to in order to mark this dependency and connection.<p>the Lord&#8212;Ha-Adon in Hebrew. The article marks that it is Jehovah (Ex 23:17; 34:23; compare Jos 3:11, 13). Compare Da 9:17, where the Divine Son is meant by "for THE Lord's sake." God the speaker makes "the Lord," the "messenger of the covenant," one with Himself. "I will send &#8230; before Me," adding, "THE Lord &#8230; shall &#8230; come"; so that "the Lord" must be one with the "Me," that is, He must be God, "before" whom John was sent. As the divinity of the Son and His oneness with the Father are thus proved, so the distinctness of personality is proved by "I send" and He "shall come," as distinguished from one another. He also comes to the temple as "His temple": marking His divine lordship over it, as contrasted with all creatures, who are but "servants in" it (Hag 2:7; Heb 3:2, 5, 6).<p>whom ye seek &#8230; whom ye delight in&#8212;(see on [1194]Mal 2:17). At His first coming they "sought" and "delighted in" the hope of a temporal Saviour: not in what He then was. In the case of those whom Malachi in his time addresses, "whom ye seek &#8230; delight in," is ironical. They unbelievingly asked, When will He come at last? Mal 2:17, "Where is the God of judgment" (Isa 5:19; Am 5:18; 2Pe 3:3, 4)? In the case of the godly, the desire for Messiah was sincere (Lu 2:25, 28). He is called "Angel of God's presence" (Isa 63:9), also Angel of Jehovah. Compare His appearances to Abraham (Ge 18:1, 2, 17, 33), to Jacob (Ge 31:11; 48:15, 16), to Moses in the bush (Ex 3:2-6); He went before Israel as the Shekinah (Ex 14:19), and delivered the law at Sinai (Ac 7:38).<p>suddenly&#8212;This epithet marks the second coming, rather than the first; the earnest of that unexpected coming (Lu 12:38-46; Re 16:15) to judgment was given in the judicial expulsion of the money-changing profaners from the temple by Messiah (Mt 21:12, 13), where also as here He calls the temple His temple. Also in the destruction of Jerusalem, most unexpected by the Jews, who to the last deceived themselves with the expectation that Messiah would suddenly appear as a temporal Saviour. Compare the use of "suddenly" in Nu 12:4-10, where He appeared in wrath.<p>messenger of the covenant&#8212;namely, of the ancient covenant with Israel (Isa 63:9) and Abraham, in which the promise to the Gentiles is ultimately included (Ga 4:16, 17). The gospel at the first advent began with Israel, then embraced the Gentile world: so also it shall be at the second advent. All the manifestations of God in the Old Testament, the Shekinah and human appearances, were made in the person of the Divine Son (Ex 23:20, 21; Heb 11:26; 12:26). He was the messenger of the old covenant, as well as of the new.The forerunner, and coming of the Messiah to cleanse his church, and to judge the wicked, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts....">Malachi 3:1-6</a></span>.

De Dieu observes, that the word in the Ethiopic language signifies a prince as well as a messenger, and so may be rendered, "the Prince of the covenant", which is a way of speaking used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22</a>, <p>whom ye delight in; either carnally, as they pleased themselves with the thoughts of a temporal prince, and of great honour and grandeur under him; and as they would have done, had he submitted to have been made a king by them in this sense; or rather spiritually, and so is to be understood of such who had a spiritual knowledge of him, and joy in him; who rejoiced and delighted in the contemplation of his person, offices, righteousness, and salvation: <p>he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts; this expresses the certainty of his coming, being said by himself, who is the Lord of hosts, the Lord of armies in heaven and in earth, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.

The weight of argument, however, seems clearly to preponderate in favour of identifying the “Messenger of the Covenant” with “the Lord”, who shall “suddenly come to His temple”. For thus the idea of <span class="ital">the messenger</span>, which pervades this prophecy (see Introd. pp. 13, 14) culminates (as do the Old Testament ideas of the prophet, the priest and the king) in the Messiah, who is in the highest sense the Messenger of God to man. The Angel, or Messenger, whose presence in the Church was recognised from the beginning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared....">Exodus 23:20-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm" title="Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin on them.">Exodus 32:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm" title="And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:">Exodus 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm" title="And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.">Exodus 33:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm" title="In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.">Isaiah 63:9</a>), follows up these “preludings of the Incarnation” by being “made flesh and dwelling amongst us”. The covenant, which was before the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>) and yet by virtue of its later introduction “a new covenant” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:...">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-7.htm" title="For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second....">Hebrews 8:7-13</a>), He comes, in fulfilment of promise and prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm" title="I the LORD have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm" title="Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.">Isaiah 55:3</a>), as its Messenger and Mediator (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>), to inaugurate and ratify with His blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>); while He vindicates His claim to be “the God of judgment” whom they desired, by the work of discriminating justice which He performs (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-2.htm" title="But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:...">Malachi 3:2-5</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will send</span> (<span class="accented">I send</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my messenger.</span> God answers that he is coming to show himself the God of judgment and justice. Are they ready to meet him and to bear his sentence? Who this "messenger" is is disputed. That no angel or heavenly visitant is meant is clear from historical considerations, as no such event took place immediately before the Lord came to his temple. Nor can Malachi himself be intended, as his message was delivered nearly four, hundred years before Messiah came. The announcement is doubtless founded upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, and refers to the same person as the older prophet mentions, who is generally allowed to be John the Baptist, the herald of Christ's advent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-10.htm">Matthew 11:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Prepare the way before me.</span> The expression is borrowed from Isaiah, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>).

"And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold a man, His name is Tsemach (Sprout), and from His place will He sprout up, and build the temple of Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a>. And He will build the temple of Jehovah, and He will carry loftiness, and will sit and rule upon His throne, and will be a priest upon His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between them both. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>. And the crown will be to Chelem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedahjah, and the favour of the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>. And they that are far off will come and build at the temple of Jehovah; then will ye know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you; and it will come to pass, if ye hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God." Two things are stated in these verses concerning the crown: (1) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> the meaning is explained of the setting of the crown upon the head of Joshua the high priest; and (2) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-14.htm">Zechariah 6:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>, an explanation is given of the circumstance, that the crown had been made of silver and gold presented by men of the captivity. The crowning of Joshua the high priest with a royal crown, which did not properly belong to the high priest as such, as his headdress is neither called a crown (&#8219;a&#774;ta&#770;ra&#770;h) nor formed part of the insignia of royal dignity and glory, had a typical significance. It pointed to a man who would sit upon his throne as both ruler and priest, that is to say, would combine both royalty and priesthood in his own person and rank. The expression "Speak thou to him" shows that the words of Jehovah are addressed to Joshua, and to him alone (&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is singular), and therefore that Zerubbabel must not be interpolated into <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> along with Joshua. The man whom Joshua is to represent or typify, by having a crown placed upon his head, is designated as the Messiah, by the name Tsemach (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>); and this name is explained by the expression &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495;. These words must not be taken impersonally, in the sense of "under him will it sprout" (lxx, Luth., Calov., Hitzig, Maurer, and others); for this thought cannot be justified from the usage of the language, to say nothing of its being quite remote from the context, since we have &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, and not &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (under him); and moreover, the change of subject in &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1495; and &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; would be intolerably harsh. In addition to this, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>, the Messiah is called Tsemach, because Jehovah causes a righteous growth to spring up to David, so that Tsemach is the sprouting one, and not he who makes others or something else to sprout. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, "from under himself," is equivalent to "from his place" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-23.htm">Exodus 10:23</a>), i.e., from his soil; and is correctly explained by Alting in Hengstenberg thus: "both as to his nation and as to his country, of the house of David, Judah, and Abraham, to whom the promises were made." It also contains an allusion to the fact that He will grow from below upwards, from lowliness to eminence.<p>This Sprout will build the temple of the Lord. That these words do not refer to the building of the earthly temple of stone and wood, as Ros. and Hitzig with the Rabbins suppose, is so obvious, that even Koehler has given up this view here, and understands the words, as Hengstenberg, Tholuck, and others do, as relating to the spiritual temple, of which the tabernacle and the temples of both Solomon and Zerubbabel were only symbols, the temple which is the church of God itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21-22</a>). Zechariah not only speaks of this temple here, but also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>, as Haggai had done before him, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-9</a>, which puts the correctness of our explanation of these passages beyond the reach of doubt. The repetition of this statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> is not useless, but serves, as the emphatic &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; before this and the following sentence shows, to bring the work of the Tsemach into connection with the place He will occupy, in other words, to show the glory of the temple to be built. The two clauses are to be linked together thus: "He who will build the temple, the same will carry eminence." There is no "antithesis to the building of the temple by Joshua and Zerubbabel" (Koehler) in &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; but this is quite as foreign to the context as another view of the same commentator, viz., that <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> interrupts the explanation of what the shoot is to be. &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;, eminence, is the true word for regal majesty (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>). In this majesty He will sit upon His throne and rule, also using His regal dignity and power for the good of His people, and will be a Priest upon His throne, i.e., will be at once both Priest and King upon the throne which He assumes. The rendering, "And there will be a priest upon His throne" (Ewald and Hitzig), is precluded by the simple structure of the sentences, and still more by the strangeness of the thought which it expresses; for the calling of a priest in relation to God and the people is not to sit upon a throne, but to stand before Jehovah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). Even the closing words of this verse, "And a counsel of peace will be between them both," do not compel us to introduce a priest sitting upon the throne into the text by the side of the Tsemach ruling upon His throne. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; cannot be taken as a neuter in the sense of "between the regal dignity of the Messiah and His priesthood" (Capp., Ros.), and does not even refer to the Tsemach and Jehovah, but to the Mo&#772;she&#772;l and Ko&#772;he&#772;n, who sit upon the throne, united in one person, in the Tsemach. Between these two there will be &#8219;a&#774;tsath sha&#770;lo&#772;m. This does not merely mean, "the most perfect harmony will exist" (Hofmann, Umbreit), for that is a matter of course, and does not exhaust the meaning of the words. &#8219;Atsath sha&#770;lo&#772;m, counsel of peace, is not merely peaceful, harmonious consultation, but consultation which has peace for its object; and the thought is the following: The Messiah, who unites in Himself royalty and priesthood, will counsel and promote the peace of His people.<p>This is the typical meaning of the crowning of the high priest Joshua. But another feature is added to this. The crown, which has been placed upon the head of Joshua, to designate him as the type of the Messiah, is to be kept in the temple of the Lord after the performance of this act, as a memorial for those who bring the silver and gold from the exiles in Babel, and &#1500;&#1495;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1510;, i.e., for the favour or grace of the son of Zephaniah. Che&#772;n is not a proper name, or another name for Josiah, but an appellative in the sense of favour, or a favourable disposition, and refers to the favour which the son of Zephaniah has shown to the emigrants who have come from Babylon, by receiving them hospitably into his house. For a memorial of these men, the crown is to be kept in the temple of Jehovah. The object of this is not merely "to guard it against profanation, and perpetuate the remembrance of the givers" (Kliefoth); but this action has also a symbolical and prophetic meaning, which is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a> in the words, "Strangers will come and build at the temple of the Lord." Those who have come from the far distant Babylon are types of the distant nations who will help to build the temple of the Lord with their possessions and treasures. This symbolical proceeding therefore furnishes a confirmation of the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>, that the Lord will fill His temple with the treasures of all nations. By the realization of what is indicated in this symbolical proceeding, Israel will perceive that the speaker has been sent to them by the Lord of hosts; that is to say, not that Zechariah has spoken by the command of God, but that the Lord has sent the angel of Jehovah. For although in what precedes, only the prophet, and not the angel of Jehovah, has appeared as acting and speaking, we must not change the "sending" into "speaking" here, or take the formula &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in any other sense here than in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-13.htm">Zechariah 2:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>. We must therefore assume, that just as the words of the prophet pass imperceptibly into words of Jehovah, so here they pass into the words of the angel of Jehovah, who says concerning himself that Jehovah has sent him. The words conclude with the earnest admonition to the hearers, that they are only to become partakers of the predicted good when they hearken to the voice of their God. The sentence commencing with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not contain any aposiopesis; there is no valid ground for such an assumption as this in the simple announcement, which shows no trace of excitement; but veha&#770;ha&#770;h may be connected with the preceding thought, "ye will know," etc., and affirms that they will only discern that the angel of Jehovah has been sent to them when they pay attention to the voice of their God. Now, although the recognition of the sending of the angel of the Lord involves participation in the Messianic salvation, the fact that this recognition is made to depend upon their giving heed to the word of God, by no means implies that the coming of the Messiah, or the participation of the Gentiles in His kingdom, will be bound up with the fidelity of the covenant nation, as Hengstenberg supposes; but the words simply declare that Israel will not come to the knowledge of the Messiah or to His salvation, unless it hearkens to the voice of the Lord. Whoever intentionally closes his eyes, will be unable to see the salvation of God.<p>The question whether the prophet really carried out the symbolical action enjoined upon him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-10.htm">Zechariah 6:10</a>., externally or not, can neither be answered in the affirmative nor with a decided negative. The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>, that the prophet who was hardly a goldsmith, was to make the crown, is no more a proof that it was not actually done, than the talmudic notice in Middoth iii., concerning the place where the crown was hung up in the temple, is a proof that it was. For &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a> may also express causing to be made; and the talmudic notice referred to does not affirm that this crown was kept in the temple, but simply states that in the porch of the temple there were beams stretching from one wall to the other, and that golden chains were fastened to them, upon which the priestly candidates climbed up and saw crowns; and the verse before us is then quoted, with the formula &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as a confirmation of this. </body></html>
