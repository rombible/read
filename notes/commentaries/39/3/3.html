Here is a prophecy of the appearing of John the Baptist. He is Christ's harbinger. He shall prepare the way before him, by calling men to repentance. The Messiah had been long called, He that should come, and now shortly he will come. He is the Messenger of the covenant. Those who seek Jesus, shall find pleasure in him, often when not looked for. The Lord Jesus, prepares the sinner's heart to be his temple, by the ministry of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, and he enters it as the Messenger of peace and consolation. No hypocrite or formalist can endure his doctrine, or stand before his tribunal. Christ came to distinguish men, to separate between the precious and the vile. He shall sit as a Refiner. Christ, by his gospel, shall purify and reform his church, and by his Spirit working with it, shall regenerate and cleanse souls. He will take away the dross found in them. He will separate their corruptions, which render their faculties worthless and useless. The believer needs not fear the fiery trial of afflictions and temptations, by which the Saviour refines his gold. He will take care it is not more intense or longer than is needful for his good; and this trial will end far otherwise than that of the wicked. Christ will, by interceding for them, make them accepted. Where no fear of God is, no good is to be expected. Evil pursues sinners. God is unchangeable. And though the sentence against evil works be not executed speedily, yet it will be executed; the Lord is as much an enemy to sin as ever. We may all apply this to ourselves. Because we have to do with a God that changes not, therefore it is that we are not consumed; because his compassions fail not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And He shall sit - o as a King and Judge on His throne, with authority, yet also to try accurately the cause of each, separating seeming virtues from real graces; hypocrites, more or less consciously, from His true servants.<p>He shall purify o the sons of Levi - These had been first the leaders in degeneracy, the corrupters of the people by their example and connivance.

So the Lord in the case of His elect (Job 23:10; Ps 66:10; Pr 17:3; Isa 48:10; Heb 12:10; 1Pe 1:7). He will sit down to the work, not perfunctorily, but with patient love and unflinching justice. The Angel of the Covenant, as in leading His people out of Egypt by the pillar of cloud and fire, has an aspect of terror to His foes, of love to His friends. The same separating process goes on in the world as in each Christian. When the godly are completely separated from the ungodly, the world will end. When the dross is taken from the gold of the Christian, he will be for ever delivered from the furnace of trial.

Kimchi interprets this, as he does the latter part of the preceding verse <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>, of the day, and not of the Lord, which he compares to a judge that sits and separates the guilty from the innocent; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a> but it is to be understood of the Lord himself, and expresses his diligence in sitting and separating good men and principles from bad ones, just as silver is purified and refined from dross. Maimonides (a) understands the passage of the Messiah; for he says, <p>"in the days of the King Messiah, when his kingdom is restored, and all Israel shall be gathered to him, all will have their genealogies set right by his mouth, through the Holy Spirit that rests upon him, as it is said, "he shall sit a refiner and purifier":'' <p>as a refiner sits and observes his metal while it is melting, and waits the proper time to pour it out and separate the dross from it; so Christ is here represented as sitting, while his people are purifying and refining by the various ways and means he makes use of: it denotes the continued care of Christ over them; his eye is upon them, that nothing be lost but their dross and corruption; and his patience in waiting to be gracious to them, and do them good; and his diligent attention to the proper season of doing it; designing by all that he does, not their hurt and damage, but their real good, for he saves them, though it be by fire; and indeed every trial and affliction is for the purifying of their souls, and the brightening of their graces, and increasing their spiritual experience, light, and knowledge. <p>And he shall purify the sons of Levi; the priests, either literally understood, some of these were converted from their evil principles and practices, and became obedient to the doctrines of the Gospel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a> or figuratively, the apostles of Christ and ministers of the Gospel, who were made clean by him; or rather all the people of God, who are made priests as well as kings, and are a royal priesthood, and are purified by Christ, both by his blood, and the imputation of his righteousness, by which they become without spot and blemish, and as white as snow; and by the Spirit in sanctification, he sprinkling clean water upon them, and purifying their hearts by faith in the blood of Jesus; and also by afflictive dispensations of Providence sanctified unto them. Mention is made of the priests and Levites, because these were so very corrupt in the times of Christ, and as appears from the preceding chapters. <p>And purge them as gold and silver; are purged in the fire from their dross: this shows of what worth and value, and in what esteem the Lord's people are to him; he reckons of them as gold and silver, and as his peculiar treasure: and it suggests, that before conversion they are joined unto and mixed with wicked men, comparable to dross; and that they have in them the dross, corruption, and impurity of sin; which is original and natural to them, and inherent in them, and which can only be removed by the grace of God and blood of Christ. <p>That they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; themselves, their bodies and souls; the sacrifices of prayer, praise, and alms deeds; to the offering up of which in righteousness, in sincerity and truth, in an upright way, it is necessary that a person should be purified by the blood of Christ, and sanctified by the grace of his Spirit. <p>(a) Hilchot Melachim, c. 12. sect. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/malachi/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he shall sit <i>as</i> a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</span><p>(e) He begins at the priests, that they might be lights, and shine unto others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/malachi/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">he shall sit</span>] The expression gives “pictorial effect” (Hengst.) to the description.

"It came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, on the fourth (day) of the ninth month, in Kislev." In this definition of the time we are surprised first of all at the circumstance, that, according to the Masoretic accentuation, and the division of the verses, the statement of the time is torn into two halves, and the notice of the year is placed after &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, whilst that of the month does not follow till after &#1492;&#1514;&#1492; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497;; and secondly, at the fact that the introduction of the occurrence which led to this word of God is appended with the imperfect c. Vav rel. (vayyishlach), which would then stand in the sense of the pluperfect in opposition to the rule. On these grounds we must give up the Masoretic division of the verses, and connect the notice of the month and day in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-2.htm">Zechariah 7:2</a>, so that <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1</a> contains merely the general statement that in the fourth year of king Darius the word of the Lord came to Zechariah. What follows will then be appended thus: On the fourth day of the ninth month, in Kislev, Bethel sent, etc. Thus the more precise definition of the time is only given in connection with the following occurrence, because it was self-evident that the word of God which was addressed to the prophet in consequence of that event, could not have been addressed to him before it occurred. The rendering of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-2.htm">Zechariah 7:2</a> is also a disputed point. We adopt the following: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-2.htm">Zechariah 7:2</a>. "Then Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and his people, to entreat the face of Jehovah, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-3.htm">Zechariah 7:3</a>) to speak to the priests who were at the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, thus: Shall I weep, abstaining in the fifth month as I have now done so many years?" As Be&#772;th-e&#772;l may either signify the house of God, or be the name of the town of Bethel, it may be taken either as accus. loci, or as the subject of the sentence. Against the first explanation, which is very widely spread, viz., "it sent to the house of God, or to Bethel, Sharezer," etc., or "they sent to the house of God Sharezer," etc., it may be argued not only that the prophet, in order to make himself intelligible, ought either to have written 'el Be&#772;th-'e&#772;l, or to have placed Be&#772;th-'e&#772;l after the object, but also that beeth-'eel cannot be shown to have been ever applied to the temple of Jehovah, and that it would have been altogether out of place to speak of sending to Bethel, because Jehovah could not be prayed to in Bethel after the captivity. We must therefore take be&#772;th-'e&#772;l as the subject, and understand it as denoting the population of Bethel, and not as a name given to the church of the Lord, since there are no conclusive passages to support any such use, as be&#772;th Yeho&#772;va&#770;h only is used for the church of God (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>), and here there could be no inducement to employ so unusual an epithet to denote the nation. A considerable number of the earlier inhabitants of Bethel had already returned with Zerubbabel, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-32.htm">Nehemiah 7:32</a>; and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, the little town appears to have been soon rebuilt. The inhabitants of this city sent an embassy to Jerusalem, namely Sharezer and Rechem-Melech, and his men. The omission of the nota accus. &#1488;&#1514; has indeed been adduced as an objection to this interpretation of the names as the object, and the names have been therefore taken as the subject, and regarded as in apposition to Be&#772;th-e&#772;l: "Bethel, namely Sharezer and Rechem, etc., sent;" that is to say, two men are mentioned in connection with Bethel, who are supposed to have acted as leaders of the embassy. But there is something so harsh and inflexible in the assumption of such an apposition as this, that in spite of the omission of the &#1488;&#1514; we prefer to regard the names as accusatives. The name Sharezer is evidently Assyrian (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm">Jeremiah 39:13</a>), so that the man was probably born in Babylonia.<p>The object of sending these men is given first of all in general terms: viz., &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497;, lit., to stroke the face of Jehovah, - an anthropomorphic expression for affectionate entreaty (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-58.htm">Psalm 119:58</a>), and then defined more precisely in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-3.htm">Zechariah 7:3</a>, where it is stated that they were to inquire of the priests and prophets, i.e., through their mediation, to entreat an answer from the Lord, whether the mourning and fasting were to be still kept up in the fifth month. Through the clause &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1497; the priests are described as belonging to the house of Jehovah, though not in the sense supposed by Kliefoth, namely, "because they were appointed to serve in His house along with the Levites, in the place of the first-born, who were the possession of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-41.htm">Numbers 3:41</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8-9</a>). There is no such allusion here; but the meaning is simply, "as the persons in the temple, who by virtue of their mediatorial service were able to obtain an answer from Jehovah to a question addressed to Him in prayer." The connection with the prophets points to this. The question &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is defined by the inf. absol. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, as consisting in weeping or lamentation connected with abstinence from food and drink, i.e., with fasting. On this use of the inf. abs., see Ewald, 280, a; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, to abstain (in this connection from meat and drink), is synonymous with &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>. &#1494;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468; &#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;: "these how many years," for which we should say, "so many years." Kammeh suggests the idea of an incalculably long duration. &#1494;&#1492;, in this and other similar combinations with numerical data, has acquired the force of an adverb: now, already (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12</a>, and Ewald, 302, b). The subject to &#1488;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is the population of Bethel, by which the men had been delegated. The question, however, had reference to a subject in which the whole community was interested, and hence the answer from God is addressed to all the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>). So far as the circumstances themselves are concerned, we can see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>, that during the captivity the Israelites had adopted the custom of commemorating the leading incidents in the Chaldaean catastrophe by keeping fast-days in the fifth, seventh, fourth, and tenth months. In the fifth month (Ab), on the tent day, because, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12-13</a>, that was the day on which the temple and the city of Jerusalem were destroyed by fire in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, though the seventh day of that month is the date given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-9</a> (see the comm. in loc.). In the seventh month, according to Jewish tradition, they fasted on the third day, on account of the murder of the governor Gedaliah, and the Judaeans who had been left in the land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-25.htm">2 Kings 25:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>.). In the fourth month Tammuz) they fasted on the ninth day, on account of the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in the eleventh year of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-2.htm">Jeremiah 39:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6-7</a>). And lastly, in the tenth month, a fast was kept on the tenth day on account of the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar on that day, in the ninth year of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>).<p>(Note: The later Jews kept the 9th Ab as the day when both the first and second temples were destroyed by fire; and in Mishna Taanit iv. 6, five disasters are enumerated, which had fallen upon Israel on that day: viz., (1) the determination of God not to suffer the fathers to enter the promised land; (2 and 3) the destruction of the first and second temples; (4) the conquest of the city of Bether in the time of Bar-Cochba; (5) the destruction of the holy city, which Rashi explains from <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>, but which others refer to the fact that Turnus Rufus (either Turannius Rufus or T. Annius Rufus: cf. Schttgen, Horae hebr. et talm. ii. 953ff., and Jost, Gesch. des Judenthums, ii. 77) ploughed over the foundation of the temple. Also, on the seventeenth of the fourth month (Tammuz), according to Mishna Taan. iv. 6, five disasters are said to have befallen Israel: (1) the breaking of the tables of the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>); (2) the cessation of the daily sacrifice in the first temple from the want of sacrificial lambs (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>); (3) the breach made in the city walls; (4) the burning of the law by Apostemus; and (5) the setting up of the abomination, i.e., of an idol, in the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13</a>). Vid., Lundius, Codex talm. de jejunio, Traf. ad Rhen. 1694, p. 55ff.; also in abstract in Mishna ed. Surenhus. ii. pp. 382-3.)<p>The question put by the delegates referred simply to the fasting in the fifth month, in commemoration of the destruction of the temple. And now that the rebuilding of the temple was rapidly approaching completion, it appeared no longer in character to continue to keep this day, especially as the prophets had proclaimed on the part of God, that the restoration of the temple would be a sign that Jehovah had once more restored His favour to the remnant of His people. If this fast-day were given up, the others would probably be also relinquished. The question actually involved the prayer that the Lord would continue permanently to bestow upon His people the favour which He had restored to them, and not only bring to completion the restoration of the holy place, which was already begun, but accomplish generally the glorification of Israel predicted by the earlier prophets. The answer given by the Lord through Zechariah to the people refers to this, since the priests and prophets could give no information in the matter of their own accord.<p>The answer from the Lord divides itself into two parts, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-4.htm">Zechariah 7:4-14</a> and ch. 8. In the first part He explains what it is that He requires of the people, and why He has been obliged to punish them with exile: in the second He promises them the restoration of His favour and the promised salvation. Each of these parts is divisible again into two sections, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-4.htm">Zechariah 7:4-7</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-8.htm">Zechariah 7:8-14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-1.htm">Zechariah 8:1-17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-18.htm">Zechariah 8:18-23</a>; and each of these sections opens with the formula, "The word of Jehovah (of hosts) came to me (Zechariah), saying." </body></html>
