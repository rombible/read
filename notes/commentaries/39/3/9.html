God gives them a gracious call. But they said, Wherein shall we return? God notices what returns our hearts make to the calls of his word. It shows great perverseness in sin, when men make afflictions excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them and their sins. Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must be served in the first place; and the interest of our souls ought to be preferred before that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide for their comfort. God has blessings ready for us, but through the weakness of our faith and the narrowness of our desires, we have not room to receive them. He who makes trial will find nothing is lost by honouring the Lord with his substance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye have been cursed with the curse - (not "with a curse"). The curse threatened had come upon them: but, as fore-supposed in Leviticus by the repeated burden, "If ye still walk contrary to Me," they had persevered in evil. God had already shown His displeasure. But they, so far from being amended by it, were the more hardened in their sin. Perhaps as men do, they pleaded their punishment, as a reason why they should not amend. They defrauded God, under false pretences. They were impoverished by His curse, and so they could not afford to pay the tithes; as men say, "the times are bad; so we cannot help the poor" of Christ. "And Me ye still are defrauding"  Me, ye; man, God. And that not one or other, but this whole people. It was a requital as to that, in which they had offended.  "Because ye have not rendered tithes and first-fruits, therefore ye are cursed in famine and penury."  "Because the people did not render tithes and first-fruits to the Levites, the Lord saith, that He Himself suffered fraud, whose ministers, constrained by hunger and penury, deserted the temple. For, if He is visited by others in prison, and sick, is received and cared for, and, hungry and athirst, receives food and drink, why should He not receive tithes in His ministers, and, if they are not given, be Himself deprived of His portion?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. cursed&#8212;(Mal 2:2). As ye despoil Me, so I despoil you, as I threatened I would, if ye continued to disregard Me. In trying to defraud God we only defraud ourselves. The eagle who robbed the altar set fire to her nest from the burning coal that adhered to the stolen flesh. So men who retain God's money in their treasuries will find it a losing possession. No man ever yet lost by serving God with a whole heart, nor gained by serving Him with a half one. We may compromise with conscience for half the price, but God will not endorse the compromise; and, like Ananias and Sapphira, we shall lose not only what we thought we had purchased so cheaply, but also the price we paid for it. If we would have God "open" His treasury, we must open ours. One cause of the barrenness of the Church is the parsimony of its members [Moore].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye, </span> O priests, your sin, your sacrilege, of which you are guilty, hath provoked me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Are cursed with a curse; </span> are greatly cursed, and are likely still to be cursed, the curse shall continue whilst you continue in this your sinful course. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For ye have robbed me; </span> this brought, increased, and multiplied your curse.

Or "with penury", as the Vulgate Latin version; which, though not a proper rendering of the word, is the meaning of the curse they were cursed with; rain was withheld from them for their sins, and the earth did not bring forth its usual increase; wherefore there was want of food in all their land; their blessings were cursed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-2.htm">Malachi 2:2</a> for the following reason, <p>for ye have robbed me; because of this their iniquity, in not bringing their offerings to the Lord, and the tithes to the priests and Levites, their land was stricken with barrenness, and God gave them cleanness of teeth, and want of bread in all places: or, "but ye have robbed me" (d); notwithstanding they were thus chastised of the Lord, yet were not reformed, but went on in withholding from God and the priests, what belonged to them: <p>even this whole nation; the sin was become general, and therefore a general judgment was inflicted on them: Grotius thinks, that the people seeing the priests withhold the tithes from the Levites, they refused to pay them to them, and so the sin became universal.

The introduction of the prophet's name in the heading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-8.htm">Zechariah 7:8</a> does not warrant the strange opinion held by Schmieder and Schlier - namely, that our prophet is here reproducing the words of an earlier Zechariah who lived before the captivity - but is merely to be attributed to a variation in the form of expression. This divine word was as follows: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>. "Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute judgment of truth, and show love and compassion one to another. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>. And widows and orphans, strangers and destitute ones, oppress not; and meditate not in your heart the injury of every brother. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>. But they refused to attend, and offered a rebellious shoulder, and hardened their ears that they might not hear. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>. And they made their heart diamond, that they might not hear the law and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent through His Spirit by means of the former prophet, so that great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts." &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is to be taken as a preterite here, referring to what Jehovah had caused to be proclaimed to the people before the captivity. The kernel of this announcement consisted in the appeal to the people, to keep the moral precepts of the law, to practise the true love of the neighbour in public life and private intercourse. Mishpat 'e&#774;meth, judgment of truth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>), is such an administration of justice as simply fixes the eye upon the real circumstances of any dispute, without any personal considerations whatever, and decides them in accordance with truth. For the fact itself, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6-9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>, etc. &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;, the injury of a man who is his brother (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>); not "injury one towards another," which would suppose a transposition of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;.

Na&#770;than ka&#770;the&#772;ph so&#772;rereth: to give or offer a rebellious shoulder, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>. The figure is borrowed from an ox, which will not allow a yoke to be placed upon its neck (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>). To make the ears heavy (hikhb&#305;&#772;d), away from hearing, i.e., so that they do not hear (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>). To make the heart diamond (sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r), i.e., as hard as diamond. A stony heart is a heart not susceptible to impressions (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). The relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before sha&#770;lach refers to the two nouns named before, viz., to&#772;ra&#770;h and debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, though we need not on that account take to&#772;ra&#770;h in the general sense of instruction. God also sent the law to the people through the prophets, i.e., caused them to preach it and impress it upon their hearts. The consequence of this obduracy of the people was, that "there arose great wrath from Jehovah" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>). </body></html>
