The yoke of Christ is easy. But those who work wickedness, tempt God by presumptuous sins. Judge of things as they will appear when the doom of these proud sinners comes to be executed. Those that feared the Lord, spake kindly, for preserving and promoting mutual love, when sin thus abounded. They spake one to another, in the language of those that fear the Lord, and think on his name. As evil communications corrupt good minds and manners, so good communications confirm them. A book of remembrance was written before God. He will take care that his children perish not with those that believe not. They shall be vessels of mercy and honour, when the rest are made vessels of wrath and dishonour. The saints are God's jewels; they are dear to him. He will preserve them as his jewels, when the earth is burned up like dross. Those who now own God for theirs, he will then own for his. It is our duty to serve God with the disposition of children; and he will not have his children trained up in idleness; they must do him service from a principle of love. Even God's children stand in need of sparing mercy. All are righteous or wicked, such as serve God, or such as serve him not: all are going to heaven or to hell. We are often deceived in our opinions concerning both the one and the other; but at the bar of Christ, every man's character will be known. As to ourselves, we have need to think among which we shall have our lot; and, as to others, we must judge nothing before the time. But in the end all the world will confess that those alone were wise and happy, who served the Lord and trusted in Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels - o the recurrence of the words, &#1506;&#1513;&#1492; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-21.htm">Malachi 3:21</a>.

"In the day of judgment, those who fear Me and believe and maintain My providence shall be to Me a special treasure, i. e., a people uniquely belonging and precious to Me, blessed in the vision and fruition of Me. For as in the old law, Israel was a special treasure  a special people  and inheritance of God, chosen out of all nations, so in the new law, Christians, and those who are righteous through grace, are the special treasure of God, and in heaven shall be His special treasure in glory, possessed by God and possessing God.' The "special treasure," is something, much prized, made great store of, and guarded. Such are Christians, bought at a great price, even by the precious Blood of Christ; but much more evidently such shall they be, Malachi says, in all eternity, which that day of final retribution shall decide , "joying in the participation of their Creator, by Whose eternity they are fixed, by Whose truth they are assured, by Whose gift they are holy."<p>And I will spare them - It is a remarkable word, as used of those who should be to Him a "special treasure," teaching that, not of their own merits, they shall be such, but by His great mercy. It stands in contrast with the doom of the wicked, whom that day shall sentence to everlasting less of God. Still, the saved also shall have needed the tender mercy  of God, whereby He pardoned their misdeeds and had compassion upon them <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>, "If Thou, Lord, shalt lay up iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?" Among those whom God will spare on that day, will be countless, whom the self-righteous despised as sinners.  "I will spare them, although formerly sinners; I will spare them, repenting, and serving Me with the service of a pious confession, as a man spareth his own son which served him." For our Lord saith of the son, who refused to go work in his Father's vineyard, and afterward repented and went, that he <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-31.htm">Matthew 21:31</a>, "did the will of his Father." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. jewels&#8212;(Isa 62:3). Literally, "My peculiar treasure" (Ex 19:5; De 7:6; 14:2; 26:18; Ps 135:4; Tit 2:14; 1Pe 2:9; compare Ec 2:8). Calvin translates more in accordance with Hebrew idiom, "They shall be My peculiar treasure in the day in which I will do it" (that is, fulfil My promise of gathering My completed Church; or, "make" those things come to pass foretold in Mal 3:5 above [Grotius]); so in Mal 4:3 "do" is used absolutely, "in the day that I shall do this." Maurer, not so well, translates, "in the day which I shall make," that is, appoint as in Ps 118:24.<p>as &#8230; man spareth &#8230; son&#8212;(Ps 103:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/malachi/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They shall be mine; </span> though now they seem to lie unregarded, as if they were not worth the owning, they shall appear to be mine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In that day; </span> the day wherein God will sever between men and men, and between actions and actions, which day, though ye know it not, is well known to the Lord; and beside the great day of final discrimination, God hath several other days of visitation, which are times where. in he will own his, as the good figs, &c. <span class="bld">Jeremiah 24</span>.

That is, such as fear the Lord, and think of him, hereby they are known to be his; and hereafter, in the time referred to, it will be manifest that they are his: they are Christ's already by his Father's gift of them to him; by his own purchase; by the conquests of his grace; and by the voluntary surrender of themselves: but, in the last day, they will be claimed and owned by Christ before his Father and his holy angels; and they will be known to be his, by themselves and others; and there will be no doubt about it, or questioning of it: <p>in that day when I make up my jewels; Christ has some, who are his jewels, or peculiar treasure, as the word (x) here used signifies; who are loved with an everlasting love; chosen in him; redeemed by him; justified by his righteousness; have the graces of his Spirit in them: and will be glorified: they are a peculiar people, separate from all others, and preferred unto them; for whom Christ has the strongest affection, and takes special care of: and there is a time when he will make them up; the number of them is already complete in eternal election; and there was a gathering of them together in Christ at his death; at every conversion there is an addition to them, as his regenerated and sanctified ones; and at death they are received into heaven, into his presence and bosom; and at the last day there will be a collection of them all together. The words may be rendered, even "my jewels in the day that I shall make" (y); or "the day I shall make peculiar": distinct from all others; meaning either the famous Gospel day, made by him the sun of righteousness, in which so many of his jewels are picked up, and brought in; or the day of Jerusalem's destruction, when Christ took care of his jewels, and by the preservation of them showed that they were his, even all that believed in him; so that not one perished that believed in him, when he took vengeance on his enemies, that disbelieved and rejected him. Kimchi refers this to the day of judgment. <p>And I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him; this is a favour not granted to the apostate angels; nor to the old world; nor to the Jewish nation; nor even to the Son of God; but is vouchsafed to his special people: the lives of these are spared, until they are called by grace; and though they are sometimes afflicted and chastised, it is very gently, and in love; their services are accepted, and the imperfections in them overlooked; their sins are pardoned, and they will find mercy at the great day of account; they are used in the most tender manner, not only as a son, an own son, but as an obedient one, for whom the greatest regard is had, and affection shown. <p>(x) "peculium", Munster, Pagninus, Vatablus, Tigurine version, Calvin, Drusius, Junius &amp; Tremellius.

The phrase, however, to make a treasure, is awkward and unusual, and it seems every way better to take the word (for it is really one word) a-peculiar-treasure as exegetical of the former part of the verse: <span class="bld">They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts</span> … (<span class="ital">as</span>) <span class="bld">a peculiar treasure</span>. This accords with the early use of the same word by Almighty God with reference to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-18.htm" title="And the LORD has avouched you this day to be his peculiar people, as he has promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments;">Deuteronomy 26:18</a>). And it leaves us free to give the same meaning to the intermediate clause, <span class="ital">in the day that I do, or make</span>, here and in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-3.htm" title="And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 4:3</a>.

But the frequent use in the O.T. of the verb here employed, absolutely and without any subject expressed, to denote the doing or working of the Almighty, the nature of that doing or working being undefined, or easily deducible from the context, support the rendering of R.V. margin, <span class="ital">in the day that I do this</span>. Perhaps, however, it would be better to leave the subject, as it is, unsupplied, and render, <span class="bld">in that day when I do, (or act)</span> i.e. when observation and purpose and promise pass into action.

"And the word of Jehovah of hosts came, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-2.htm">Zechariah 8:2</a>. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and with great fury I am jealous for her." The promise commences with the declaration of the Lord, that He has resolved to give active expression once more to the warmth of His love to Zion. The perfects are used prophetically of that which God had resolved to do, and was now about to accomplish. For the fact itself, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14-15</a>. This warmth of the love of God towards Zion, and of His wrath towards the nations that were hostile to Zion, will manifest itself in the facts described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a> : "Thus saith Jehovah, I return to Zion, and shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be called city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts the holy mountain." When Jerusalem was given up into the power of its foes, the Lord had forsaken His dwelling-place in the temple. Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord depart from the temple (Ezeliel <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22-23</a>). Now He is about to resume His abode in Jerusalem once more. The difference between this promise and the similar promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-13</a>, is not that in the latter passage Jehovah's dwelling in the midst of His people is to be understood in an ideal and absolute sense, whereas here it simply denotes such a dwelling as had taken place before, as Koehler supposes. This is not implied in &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, nor is it in harmony with the statement that Jerusalem is to be called a city of truth, and the temple hill the holy mountain. &#8219;Ir 'e&#774;meth does not mean "city of security," but city of truth or fidelity, i.e., in which truth and fidelity towards the Lord have their home. The temple mountain will be called the holy mountain, i.e., will be so, and will be recognised and known as being so, from the fact that Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, will sanctify it by His dwelling there. Jerusalem did not acquire this character in the period after the captivity, in which, though not defiled by gross idolatry, as in the times before the captivity, it was polluted by other moral abominations no less than it had been before. Jerusalem becomes a faithful city for the first time through the Messiah, and it is through Him that the temple mountain first really becomes the holy mountain. The opinion, that there is nothing in the promises in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3-13</a> that did not really happen to Israel in the period from Zerubbabel to Christ (Kliefoth, Koehler, etc.), is proved to be incorrect by the very words, both of this verse and also of <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-6.htm">Zechariah 8:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-7.htm">Zechariah 8:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-8.htm">Zechariah 8:8</a>, which follow. How could the simple restoration of the previous covenant relation be described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-6.htm">Zechariah 8:6</a> as something that appeared miraculous and incredible to the nation? There is only so much correctness in the view in question, that the promise does not refer exclusively to the Messianic times, but that feeble commencements of its fulfilment accompanied the completion of the work of building the temple, and the restoration of Jerusalem by Nehemiah. But the saying which follows proves that these commencements do not exhaust the meaning of the words. </body></html>
