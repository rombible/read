They seem to have been in the habit of conversing together, and comparing the promises of God towards them with the then state of affairs. God had promised that they should be a proverb among the nations for blessedness; but, say they, seeing that things are as they are, “we [feel more inclined to] call the proud happy [or blessed].” (See further in Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-15.htm" title="And now we call the proud happy; yes, they that work wickedness are set up; yes, they that tempt God are even delivered.">Malachi 3:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/malachi/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Malachi<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">‘STOUT WORDS,’ AND THEIR CONFUTATION<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-13.htm" title="Your words have been stout against me, said the LORD.

The returning exiles had not had the prosperity which they had hoped.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So many of them, even of those who had served God, began to let doubts darken their trust, and to listen to the whispers of their own hearts, reinforced by the mutterings of others, and to ask: ‘What is the use of religion? Does it make any difference to a man’s condition?’ Here had they been keeping God’s charge, and going in black garments ‘before the Lord,’ in token of penitence, and no good had come to them, while arrogant neglect of His commandments did not seem to hinder happiness, and ‘they that work wickedness are built up.’ Sinful lives appeared to have a firm foundation, and to rise high and palace-like, while righteous ones were like huts. Goodness seemed to spell ruin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What was wrong in these ‘stout words’? It was wrong to attach such worth to external acts of devotion, as if these were deserving of reward. It was wrong to suspend the duty of worship on the prosperity resulting from it, and to seek ‘profit’ from ‘keeping his charge.’ Such religion was shallow and selfish, and had the evils of the later Pharisaism in germ in it. It was wrong to yield to the doubts which the apparently unequal distribution of worldly prosperity stirred in their hearts. But the doubts themselves were almost certain to press on Old Testament believers, as well as on Old Testament scoffers, especially under the circumstances of Malachi’s time. The fuller light of Christianity has eased their pressure, but not removed it, and we have all had to face them, both when our own hearts have ached with sorrow and when pondering on the perplexities of this confused world. We look around, and, like the psalmist, see ‘the prosperity of the wicked,’ and, like him, have to confess that our ‘steps had wellnigh slipped’ at the sight. The old, old question is ever starting up. ‘Doth God know?’ The mystery of suffering and the mystery of its distribution, the apparent utter want of connection between righteousness and well-being, are still formidable difficulties in the way of believing in a loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful God, and are stock arguments of the unbeliever and perplexities of humble faith. Never to have felt the force of the difficulty is not so much the sign of steadfast faith as of scant reflection. To yield to it, and still more, to let it drive us to cast religion aside, is not merely folly, but sin. So thinks Malachi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. To the stout words of the doubters is opposed the conversation of the godly.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘<span class="ital">Then</span> they that feared the Lord spake one with another,’ nourishing their faith by believing speech with like-minded. The more the truths by which we believe are contradicted, the more should we commune with fellow-believers. Attempts to rob us should make us hold our treasure the faster. Bold avowal of the faith is especially called for when many potent voices deny it. And, whoever does not hear, God hears. Faithful words may seem lost, but they and every faithful act are written in His remembrance and will be recompensed one day. If our names and acts are written there, we may well be content to accept scanty measures of earthly good, and not be ‘envious of the foolish’ in their prosperity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Malachi’s answer to the doubters leaves all other considerations which might remove the difficulty unmentioned, and fixes on the one, the prophecy of a future which will show that it is not all the same whether a man is good or bad. It was said of an English statesman that he called a new world into existence to redress the balance of the old, and that is what the Prophet does. Christianity has taught us many other ways of meeting the doubters’ difficulty, but the sheet anchor of faith in that storm is the unconquerable assurance that a day comes when the righteousness of providence will be vindicated, and the eternal difference between good and evil manifested in the fates of men. The Prophet is declaring what will be a fact one day, but he does not know when. Probably he never asked himself whether ‘the day of the Lord’ was near or far off, to dawn on earth or to lie beyond mortal life. But this he knew-that God was righteous, and that sometime and somewhere character would settle destiny, and even outwardly it would be good to be good. He first declares this conviction in general terms, and then passes on to a magnificent and terrible picture of that great day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The promise, which lay at the foundation of Israel’s national existence, included the recognition of it as ‘a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people,’ and Malachi looks forward to that day as the epoch when God will show by His acts how precious the righteous are in His sight. Not the whole Israel, but the righteous among them, are the heirs of the old promise. It is an anticipation of the teaching that ‘they are not all Israel which are of Israel,’ And it bids us look for the fulfilment of every promise of God’s to that great day of the Lord which lies still before us all, when the gulf between the righteous and the wicked shall be solemnly visible, wide, and profound. There have been many ‘days which I make’ in the world’s history, and in a measure each of them has re-established the apparently tottering truth that there is a God who judgeth in the earth, but the day of days is yet to come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No grander vision of judgment exists than Malachi’s picture of ‘the day,’ lurid, on the one hand, with the fierce flame, before which the wicked are as stubble that crackles for a moment and then is grey ashes, or as a tree in a forest fire, which stands for a little while, a pillar of flame, and then falls with a crash, shaking the woods; and on the otherhand, radiant with the early beams of healing sunshine, in whose sweet morning light the cattle, let out from their pent-up stalls, gambol in glee. But let us not forget while we admire the noble poetry of its form that this is God’s oracle, nor that we have each to settle for ourselves whether that day shall be for us a furnace to destroy or a sun to cheer and enlighten.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We can only note in a sentence the recurrence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-1.htm" title="For, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, said the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.">Malachi 4:1</a> of the phrases ‘the proud’ and they ‘that work wickedness,’ from <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-15.htm" title="And now we call the proud happy; yes, they that work wickedness are set up; yes, they that tempt God are even delivered.">Malachi 3:15</a> The end of those whom the world called happy, and who seemed stable and elevated, is to be as stubble before the fire. We must also point out that ‘the sun of righteousness’ means the sun which is righteousness, and is not a designation of the Messiah. Nor can we dwell on the picture of the righteous treading down the wicked, which seems to prolong the previous metaphor of the leaping young cattle. Then shall ‘the upright have dominion over them in the morning.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The final exhortation and promise point backwards and forwards, summing up duty in obedience to the law, and fixing hope on a future reappearance of the leader of the prophets.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Moses and Elijah are the two giant figures which dominate the history of Israel. Law and prophecy are the two forms in which God spoke to the fathers. The former is of perpetual obligation, the latter will flash up again in power on the threshold of the day. Jesus has interpreted this closing word for us. John came ‘in the spirit and power of Elijah,’ and the purpose of his coming was to ‘turn the hearts of the fathers to the children’ {<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-16.htm" title="And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.">Luke 1:16</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm" title="And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.">Luke 1:17</a>}; that is, to bring back the devout dispositions of the patriarchs to the existing generations, and so to bring the ‘hearts of the children to their fathers,’ as united with them in devout obedience. If John’s mission had succeeded, the ‘curse’ which smote Israel would have been stayed. God has done all that He can do to keep us from being consumed by the fire of that day. The Incarnation, Life, and Death of Jesus Christ made a day of the Lord which has the twofold character of that in Malachi’s vision, for He is a ‘saviour of life unto life’ or ‘of death unto death,’ and must be one or other to us. But another day of the Lord is still to come, and for each of us it will come burning as a furnace or bright as sunrise. Then the universe shall ‘discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/malachi/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/3-13.htm" title="Your words have been stout against me, said the LORD.

Yet you have robbed me. But you say, Wherein have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings.">Malachi 3:8</a>, and some other foregoing verses. They impudently deny the charge, therefore the prophet renews it against them in the following words; <span class="ital">Ye have said — </span>If not with your lips, yet at least in your hearts; <span class="ital">It is vain to serve God — </span>We receive no advantage from it, it is of no use to us. That they should talk thus impiously in the times of Zerubbabel, when Malachi uttered these reproofs and exhortations, is not probable; but God, who sees into the hearts of men, saw, lurking in their hearts, the seeds of that impiety which broke out in the following age. <span class="ital">And what profit is it </span>— What benefit is it of to us; <span class="ital">that we have kept his ordinance — </span>That we have attended upon the institutions of his worship, and have governed our lives according to his laws? <span class="ital">And that we have walked mournfully before the Lord — </span>Have humbled ourselves before him with fasting and prayer, sackcloth and ashes.

The yoke of Christ is easy. But those who work wickedness, tempt God by presumptuous sins. Judge of things as they will appear when the doom of these proud sinners comes to be executed. Those that feared the Lord, spake kindly, for preserving and promoting mutual love, when sin thus abounded. They spake one to another, in the language of those that fear the Lord, and think on his name. As evil communications corrupt good minds and manners, so good communications confirm them. A book of remembrance was written before God. He will take care that his children perish not with those that believe not. They shall be vessels of mercy and honour, when the rest are made vessels of wrath and dishonour. The saints are God's jewels; they are dear to him. He will preserve them as his jewels, when the earth is burned up like dross. Those who now own God for theirs, he will then own for his. It is our duty to serve God with the disposition of children; and he will not have his children trained up in idleness; they must do him service from a principle of love. Even God's children stand in need of sparing mercy. All are righteous or wicked, such as serve God, or such as serve him not: all are going to heaven or to hell. We are often deceived in our opinions concerning both the one and the other; but at the bar of Christ, every man's character will be known. As to ourselves, we have need to think among which we shall have our lot; and, as to others, we must judge nothing before the time. But in the end all the world will confess that those alone were wise and happy, who served the Lord and trusted in Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Your words have been stout against Me - , probably "oppressive to  Me," as it is said, the famine was strong upon the land.

For the people who returned from Babylon seemed to have a knowledge of God, and to observe the law, and to understand their sin, and to offer sacrifices for sin; to pay tithes, to observe the sabbath, and the rest, commanded in the law of God, and seeing all the nations around them abounding in all things, and that they themselves were in penury, hunger and misery, was scandalized and said, 'What does it benefit me, that I worship the One True God, abominate idols, and, pricked with the consciousness of sin, walk mournfully before God?' A topic, which is pursued more largely in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>." Only the Psalmist relates his temptations to God, and God's deliverance of him from them; these adopted them and spake them against God.

And they made their heart diamond, that they might not hear the law and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent through His Spirit by means of the former prophet, so that great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts." &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is to be taken as a preterite here, referring to what Jehovah had caused to be proclaimed to the people before the captivity. The kernel of this announcement consisted in the appeal to the people, to keep the moral precepts of the law, to practise the true love of the neighbour in public life and private intercourse. Mishpat 'e&#774;meth, judgment of truth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>), is such an administration of justice as simply fixes the eye upon the real circumstances of any dispute, without any personal considerations whatever, and decides them in accordance with truth. For the fact itself, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6-9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>, etc. &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;, the injury of a man who is his brother (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>); not "injury one towards another," which would suppose a transposition of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a> the attitude of the people towards these admonitions of God is described. Na&#770;than ka&#770;the&#772;ph so&#772;rereth: to give or offer a rebellious shoulder, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>. The figure is borrowed from an ox, which will not allow a yoke to be placed upon its neck (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>). To make the ears heavy (hikhb&#305;&#772;d), away from hearing, i.e., so that they do not hear (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>). To make the heart diamond (sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r), i.e., as hard as diamond. A stony heart is a heart not susceptible to impressions (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). The relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before sha&#770;lach refers to the two nouns named before, viz., to&#772;ra&#770;h and debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, though we need not on that account take to&#772;ra&#770;h in the general sense of instruction. God also sent the law to the people through the prophets, i.e., caused them to preach it and impress it upon their hearts. The consequence of this obduracy of the people was, that "there arose great wrath from Jehovah" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>). </body></html>
