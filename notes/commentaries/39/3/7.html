Here we have the climax of self-revealing and patient love in God’s wooing voice to draw the wanderer back, met by man’s refusing answer. These three divine utterances taken together cover the whole ground of His speech to us; and, alas! these three human utterances but too truly represent for the most part our answers to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. God’s invitation to His wandering child.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The gracious invitation of our text presupposes a state of departure. The child who is tenderly recalled has first gone away. There has been a breach of love. Dependence has been unwelcome, and cast off with the vain hope of a larger freedom in the far-off land; and this is the true charge against us. It is not so much individual acts of sin but the going away in heart and spirit from our Father God which describes the inmost essence of our true condition, and is itself the source of all our acts of sin. Conscience confirms the description. We know that we have departed from Him in mind, having wasted our thoughts on many things and not having had Him in the multitude of them in us. We have departed from Him in heart, having squandered our love and dissipated our desires on many objects, and sought in the multiplicity of many pearls-some of them only paste-a substitute for the all-sufficient simplicity of the One of great price. We have departed from Him in will, having reared up puny inclinations and fleeting passions against His calm and eternal purpose, and so bringing about the shock of a collision as destructive to us as when a torpedo-boat crashes in the dark against a battleship, and, cut in two, sinks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The gracious invitation of our text follows, ‘I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.’ Threatenings, and the execution of these in acts of judgment, are no indication of a change in the loving heart of God; and because it is the same, however we have sinned against it and departed from it, there is ever an invitation and a welcome. We may depart from Him, but He never departs from us. Nor does He wait for us to originate the movement of return, but He invites us back. By all His words in His threatenings and in His commandments, as in the acts of His providence, we can hear His call to return. The fathers of our flesh never cease to long for their prodigal child’s return; and their patient persistence of hope is but brief and broken when contrasted with the infinite long-suffering of the Father of spirits. We have heard of a mother who for long empty years has nightly set a candle in her cottage window to guide her wandering boy back to her heart; and God has bade us think more loftily of the unchangeableness of His love than that of a woman who may forget, that she should not have compassion upon the son of her womb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Man’s answer to God’s invitation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is a refusal which is half-veiled and none the less real. There is no unwillingness to obey professed, but it is concealed under a mask of desiring a little more light as to how a return is to be accomplished. There are not many of us who are rooted enough in evil as to be able to blurt out a curt ‘I will not’ in answer to His call. Conscience often bars the way to such a plain and unmannerly reply; but there are many who try to cheat God, and who do to some extent cheat themselves, by professing ignorance of the way which would lead them to His heart. Some of us have learned only too well to raise questions about the method of salvation instead of accepting it, and to dabble in theology instead of making sure work of return. Some of us would fain substitute a host of isolated actions, or apparent moral or religious observance, for the return of will and heart to God; and all who in their consciences answer God’s call by saying, ‘Wherein shall we return?’ with such a meaning are playing tricks with themselves, and trying to hoodwink God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the question of our text has often a nobler origin, and comes from the depths of a troubled heart. Not seldom does God’s loving invitation rouse the dormant conscience to the sense of sin. The man, lying broken at the foot of the cliff down which he has fallen, and seeing the brightness of God far above, has his heart racked with the question: How am I, with lame limbs, to struggle back to the heights above? ‘How shall man be just with God?’ All the religions of the world, with their offerings and penances and weary toils, are vain attempts to make a way back to the God from whom men have wandered, and that question, ‘Wherein shall we return?’ is really the meaning of the world’s vain seeking and profitless effort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God has answered man’s question; for Christ is at once the way back to God, and the motive which draws us to walk in it. He draws us back by the magnetism of His love and sacrifice. We return to God when we cling to Jesus. He is the highest, the tenderest utterance of the divine voice; and when we yield to His invitation to Himself we return to God. He calls to each of us, ‘Come unto Me, and I will give you rest.’ What can we reply but, ‘I come; let me never wander from Thee’?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/malachi/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-7.htm" title="Even from the days of your fathers you are gone away from my ordinances, and have not kept them.

God gives them a gracious call. But they said, Wherein shall we return? God notices what returns our hearts make to the calls of his word. It shows great perverseness in sin, when men make afflictions excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them and their sins. Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must be served in the first place; and the interest of our souls ought to be preferred before that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide for their comfort. God has blessings ready for us, but through the weakness of our faith and the narrowness of our desires, we have not room to receive them. He who makes trial will find nothing is lost by honouring the Lord with his substance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even from the days of your fathers - Back to those days and from them  ye are gone away from My ordinances.

For, not in its own strength, but by His grace can the soul turn to God. "Turn thou to Me and I will return unto you," is the Voice of God, acknowledging our free-will, and promising His favor, if we accept His grace in return.<p>And ye say, Wherein shall we return? - Strange ignorance of the blinded soul, unconscious that God has aught against it! It is the Pharisaic spirit in the Gospel. It would own itself doubtless in general terms a sinner, but when called on, wholly to turn to God, as being wholly turned from Him, it asks, "In what? What would God have of me?" as if ready to do it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-12.

And when ye eat, and when ye drink, is it not ye who eat, and ye who drink? <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>. Does it not concern the words, which Jehovah has preached through the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and satisfied, and her towns round about her, and the south country and the low land were inhabited?" The thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-6.htm">Zechariah 7:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a> is the following: It is a matter of indifference to God whether the people fast or not. The true fasting, which is well pleasing to God, consists not in a pharisaical abstinence from eating and drinking, but in the fact that men observe the word of God and live thereby, as the prophets before the captivity had already preached to the people. This overthrew the notion that men could acquire the favour of God by fasting, and left it to the people to decide whether they would any longer observe the previous fast-days; it also showed what God would require of them if they wished to obtain the promised blessings. For the inf. absol. see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>. The fasting in the seventh month was not the fast on the day of atonement which was prescribed in the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>), but, as has been already observed, the fast in commemoration of the murder of Gedaliah. In the form &#1510;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; the suffix is not a substitute for the dative (Ges. 121, 4), but is to be taken as an accusative, expressive of the fact that the fasting related to God (Ewald, 315, b). The suffix is strengthened by &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; for the sake of emphasis (Ges. 121, 3). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a> the form of the sentence is elliptical. The verb is omitted in the clause &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, but not the subject, say &#1494;&#1492;, which many commentators supply, after the lxx, the Peshito, and the Vulgate ("Are these not the words which Jehovah announced?"), in which case &#1488;&#1514; would have to be taken as nota nominativi. The sentence contains an aposiopesis, and is to be completed by supplying a verb, either "should ye not do or give heed to the words which," etc.? or "do ye not know the words?" &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>, in the sense of sitting or dwelling; not in a passive sense, "to be inhabited," although it might be so expressed. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; is synonymous with &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm">Zechariah 1:11</a>. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, in the sense indicated at the close of the verse, is construed in the singular masculine, although it refers to a plurality of previous nouns (cf. Ges. 148, 2). In addition to Jerusalem, the following are mentioned as a periphrasis for the land of Judah: (1) her towns round about; these are the towns belonging to Jerusalem as the capital, towns of the mountains of Judah which were more or less dependent upon her: (2) the two rural districts, which also belonged to the kingdom of Judah, viz., the negeb, the south country (which Koehler erroneously identifies with the mountains of Judah; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>), and the shephe&#772;la&#770;h, or lowland along the coast of the Mediterranean (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>). </body></html>
