God gives them a gracious call. But they said, Wherein shall we return? God notices what returns our hearts make to the calls of his word. It shows great perverseness in sin, when men make afflictions excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them and their sins. Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must be served in the first place; and the interest of our souls ought to be preferred before that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide for their comfort. God has blessings ready for us, but through the weakness of our faith and the narrowness of our desires, we have not room to receive them. He who makes trial will find nothing is lost by honouring the Lord with his substance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/malachi/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All nations shall call you blessed - The promise goes beyond the temporal prosperity of their immediate obedience. Few could know or think much of the restored prolificalness of Judaea; none could know of its antecedents. A people, as well as individuals, may starve, and none know of it. Had the whole population of Judah died out, their Persian masters would not have cared for it, but would have sent fresh colonists to replace them and pay the tribute to the great king. The only interest, which all nations could have in them, was as being the people of God, from whom He should come, "the Desire of all nations, in whom all the families of the earth would be blessed." Of this, God's outward favor was the earnest; they should have again the blessings which He had promised to His people.<p>And ye shall be called a delightsome land - , literally "a land of good pleasure." It was not so much the land as the people; ye shall be called. The land stands for the people upon it, in whom its characteristics lay. The river Jordan was not so bright as Abana and Pharpar: "the aspect of the shore" is the same, when the inhabitants are spiritually or morally dead; only the more beautiful, in contrast with the lifeless "spirit of man." So Isaiah says <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2-4</a>, "The nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and thou shrill be called by a name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name Thou shalt no more be called Forsaken, nor shall thy land be called Desolate, but thou shalt be called My-delight-is-in-her, and thy land Married: for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married." God and man should delight in her. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/malachi/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The introduction of the prophet's name in the heading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-8.htm">Zechariah 7:8</a> does not warrant the strange opinion held by Schmieder and Schlier - namely, that our prophet is here reproducing the words of an earlier Zechariah who lived before the captivity - but is merely to be attributed to a variation in the form of expression. This divine word was as follows: <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>. "Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute judgment of truth, and show love and compassion one to another. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-10.htm">Zechariah 7:10</a>. And widows and orphans, strangers and destitute ones, oppress not; and meditate not in your heart the injury of every brother. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>. But they refused to attend, and offered a rebellious shoulder, and hardened their ears that they might not hear. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>. And they made their heart diamond, that they might not hear the law and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent through His Spirit by means of the former prophet, so that great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts." &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is to be taken as a preterite here, referring to what Jehovah had caused to be proclaimed to the people before the captivity. The kernel of this announcement consisted in the appeal to the people, to keep the moral precepts of the law, to practise the true love of the neighbour in public life and private intercourse. Mishpat 'e&#774;meth, judgment of truth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>), is such an administration of justice as simply fixes the eye upon the real circumstances of any dispute, without any personal considerations whatever, and decides them in accordance with truth. For the fact itself, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6-9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>, etc. &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;, the injury of a man who is his brother (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>); not "injury one towards another," which would suppose a transposition of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a> the attitude of the people towards these admonitions of God is described. Na&#770;than ka&#770;the&#772;ph so&#772;rereth: to give or offer a rebellious shoulder, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>. The figure is borrowed from an ox, which will not allow a yoke to be placed upon its neck (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>). To make the ears heavy (hikhb&#305;&#772;d), away from hearing, i.e., so that they do not hear (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>). To make the heart diamond (sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r), i.e., as hard as diamond. A stony heart is a heart not susceptible to impressions (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). The relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before sha&#770;lach refers to the two nouns named before, viz., to&#772;ra&#770;h and debha&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, though we need not on that account take to&#772;ra&#770;h in the general sense of instruction. God also sent the law to the people through the prophets, i.e., caused them to preach it and impress it upon their hearts. The consequence of this obduracy of the people was, that "there arose great wrath from Jehovah" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm">Zechariah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>). </body></html>
