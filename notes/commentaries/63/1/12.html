His heart is full of things to write, but he hopes soon to have unlimited conversation.<p><span class= "bld">Paper.</span>—The Egyptian <span class= "ital">papyrus.</span><p><span class= "bld">Ink.</span>—A mixture of soot, water, and gum. The papyrus-tree grows in the swamps of the Nile to the height of ten feet and more. Paper was prepared from the thin coats that surround the plant. Pliny describes the method (xiii. 23). The different pieces were joined together by the turbid Nile water, as it has a kind of glutinous property. One layer of papyrus was laid flat on a board, and a cross layer put over it; these were pressed, and afterwards dried in the sun. The sheets were then fastened or pasted together. There were never more than twenty of these sheets fastened together in a roll; but of course the length could be increased to any extent. The writing was in columns, with a blank slip between them; it was only on one side. When the work was finished, it was rolled on a staff, and sometimes wrapped in a parchment case (Smith, <span class= "ital">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, </span>p. 567).<p>Of the ink used by the Romans, Pliny says that it was made of soot in various ways, with burnt resin or pitch. “For this purpose they have built furnaces which do not allow the smoke to escape. The kind most commended is made in this way from pine-wood: it is mixed with soot from the furnaces or baths; and this they use for writing on rolls. Some also make a kind of ink by boiling and straining the lees of wine.” The black matter of the cuttle-fish was also sometimes used for writing (Smith, <span class= "ital">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</span>, p. 110).<p>The pen was a reed, sharpened with a knife, and split like a quill-pen.<p>The Jews seem to have used lamp-black dissolved in gall-juice, or lamp-black and vitriol, for ink. The modern scribes “have an apparatus consisting of a metal or ebony tube for their reed-pens, with a cup or bulb of the same material attached to the upper end for ink. This they thrust through the girdle, and carry with them at all times” (Thomson, <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book, </span>p. 131; Smith’s <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible, </span>p. 1802).<p><span class= "bld">Speak face to face.</span>—Not that there was any oral tradition which he would not write down. His Gospel and First Epistle would contain the outline of all his teaching. But on this occasion there was no need for writing. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That our joy may be full.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.">1John 1:4</a>. It would be the deep satisfaction of the interchange of spiritual thoughts and aspirations without the limitations of a monologue or of writing materials.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">The children of thy elect sister.</span>—He may have been staying at this second matron’s house; at any rate, the family knew he was writing. The simplicity of the great Apostle, the personal friend of the risen Lord, the last of the great pillars of the Church of Christ—in transmitting this familiar message, makes a most instructive finish to what is throughout a beautiful picture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_john/1-12.htm" title="Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full....">2 John 1:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Having many things to write </span>— Concerning these and other subjects; <span class="ital">I would not </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ουκ εβουληθην</span>, <span class="ital">I was not minded, </span>to communicate them by <span class="ital">paper and ink </span>— Probably the apostle meant that he had many things to say concerning the characters and actions of the false teachers; perhaps also he wished to mention to her the names of those that he had principally in view. But these things he did not think it proper to write in a letter; especially as he proposed to visit this matron and her children soon, and to converse with them personally. <span class="ital">The children of thy elect </span>— Or Christian <span class="ital">sister, greet thee </span>— It seems she was absent, if not dead, when the apostle wrote this. It is justly observed by Macknight, that “the word <span class="ital">elect </span>here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2 John 1:1</a>, doth not signify <span class="ital">chosen from eternity to salvation. </span>For the apostle could not know that the matron’s sister was so elected, unless the matter had been made known to him by a particular revelation, which is not alleged to have been the case by any who so interpret election.” But it signifies, as the same expression generally does, in other passages of Scripture, a true believer in Christ, who, as such, is in a state of acceptance with God, and one of his chosen people. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:...">Ephesians 1:3-7</a>. It is proper to observe here also, that the salutations which the Christians in the first age gave to each other, were not of the same kind with the salutations of unbelievers, which were wishes of temporal health and felicity only; but they were prayers for the health and happiness of their souls, and expressions of the most sincere love. See 3 John, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a>. The apostle sent this matron the salutation of the children of her sister, to intimate to her that they were all Christians, and that they persevered in the true doctrine of the gospel. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12,13 The apostle refers many things to a personal meeting. Pen and ink were means of strengthening and comforting others; but to see each other is more so. The communion of saints should be maintained by all methods; and should tend to mutual joy. In communion with them we find much of our present joy, and look forward to happiness for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having many things to write unto you - That I would wish to say. This language is such as would be used by one who was hurried, or who was in feeble health, or who hoped soon to see the person written to. In such a case only the points would be selected which were of most immediate and pressing importance, and the remainder would be reserved for a more free personal interview.<p>I would not write with paper - The word "paper" here conveys an idea which is not strictly correct. "Paper," as that term is now understood, was not invented until long after this period. The material designated by the word used by John (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  charte&#772;s) was the Egyptian papyrus, and the particular thing denoted was a leaf made out of that plant. The sheets were made from membranes of the plant closely pressed together. This plant was found also in Syria and Babylon, but it was produced in greater abundance in Egypt, and that was the plant which was commonly used. It was so comparatively cheap, that it in a great measure superseded the earlier materials for writing - plates of lead, or stone, or the skins of animals. It is probable that the books of the New Testament were written on this species of paper. Compare Hug, Introduction, chapter iii., Section 11.<p>And ink - The ink which was commonly employed in writing was made of soot and water, with a mixture of some species of gum to give it consistency and durability - Lucke. The instrument (pen) was made of a reed.<p>But I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face - Margin, as in Greek, "mouth to mouth." The phrase is a common one, to denote conversation with any one, especially free and confidential conversation. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>.<p>That our joy may be full - Margin, "your." The marginal reading has arisen from a variation in the Greek copies. The word "our" is best sustained, and accords best with the connection. John would be likely to express the hope that he would find pleasure from such an interview. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a>.

THE CONCLUSION OF THE EPISTLE. It is in their openings and conclusions, and especially in the latter, that the Second and Third Epistles have so strong a resemblance that we are almost compelled to assign them not merely to the same author, but to the same period in the author's life. St. John had a tenacious memory, as his writings prove; but we may doubt whether so trivial a matter as the mode of beginning and ending a short letter would have remained for years together in his mind. We may reasonably conclude from their similarity that these two Epistles are separated from one another by only a short interval of time. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having many things to write.</span> This remark is almost conclusive against the supposition that the Second Epistle was sent as a companion-letter to the First. The hypothesis has little or nothing to support it. I would not (do so) by means of paper and  ink. It is astonishing that any one should suppose that intercourse on paper is here opposed to <span class="accented">spiritual</span> intercourse: obviously it is opposed to <span class="accented">conversation.</span> The elder just writes what is of urgent importance to prevent fatal mistakes during the present time, and leaves everything else until he can talk matters over with her. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is mentioned nowhere else in the New Testament, but is found in the Septuagint (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>); it probably means "papyrus." <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-13.htm">3 John 1:13</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; it was commonly made of lampblack or other soot, and hence the name. <span class="cmt_word">But I hope to come unto you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I hope to come to be</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">at your house.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> is here very much the same as the French <span class="accented">chez vous.</span> So also <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-56.htm">Matthew 13:56</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13</a>).

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; but there the emphatic thing is that the two should <span class="accented">see</span> one another. Here the special point is that they should <span class="accented">converse</span> with one another; and this is more clearly expressed by "month to mouth" than by "face to face." For the phrase, "that <span class="accented">your</span> joy may be fulfilled," see note on 1 John 1:4, to which passage the apostle may here be consciously referring. That was ever one main purpose of his teaching - the perfecting of Christian joy. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I would not (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>.<p>Paper (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Only here in the New Testament. The Egyptian papyrus or byblus, Cyperus papyrus, anciently very common, but not now found within the limits of the country. It is a tall, smooth flag or reed, with a large triangular stalk, containing the pith which furnished the paper. The paper was manufactured by cutting the pith into strips, arranging them horizontally, and then placing across them another layer of strips, uniting the two layers by a paste, and subjecting the whole to a heavy pressure. The upper and middle portions of the reed were used for this purpose. The fact that the plant is no longer found is significant in connection with Isaiah's prophecy that "the flags (Hebrews suph, papyrus) shall waste away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>). The plant grew in shallow water or in marshes, and is accordingly represented on the monuments as at the side of a stream or in irrigated lands. The Jews wrote on various materials, such as the leaves of the olive and palm, the rind of the pomegranate, and the skins of animals. The tablet (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-63.htm">Luke 1:63</a>) was in very common use.
