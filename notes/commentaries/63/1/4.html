Having congratulated her about this, he states the chief thing which he desires of her: the pure Christian love which implies every other grace and virtue; in other words, walking after the divine commandments. That this love should be pure, that these commandments should be unimpaired, it was necessary to remember that nothing new could be added to the original message of Christ. This warning was timely, because many errors had already appeared, especially that greatest error which denied the Incarnation. The family must, therefore, be on its guard, lest it should be cheated of its reward. The test was very simple: any advance beyond the doctrine of Christ. It would be better for the family not to entertain in their house any who had committed themselves to these doctrines of development (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2John 1:4-11</a>).<p>(2 <span class= "ital">a.</span>) (4) <span class= "bld">I rejoiced . . .</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;">1Corinthians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Philippians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Of thy children.</span>—Probably those met at home.<p><span class= "bld">Walking in truth.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1John 1:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/3_john/1-3.htm" title="For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.">3John 1:3-4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As we have received a commandment</span>.—That is, walking according to the revelation of God’s will in Christ Jesus.<p>(2 <span class= "ital">b.</span>) (5) Love is the Christian’s moral disposition of mind, which embraces all other virtues and graces. It implies faith, because it is founded on Christian principle, and can only be tested by a right belief. It implies purity, because it is modelled on the love of God, and has abjured the old man. It implies unselfishness, because it desires the good of the other for his own sake and God’s. It implies humility, because it distrusts itself, relies on God, and thinks more of the other than of itself.

He is not speaking of those who had never heard or been instructed in the doctrine of Christ; they would be less dangerous. He means those who deliberately altered the Apostolic teaching. And his reason is evidently chiefly the religious welfare of the matron and her family. The case supplies an important instruction in the theory of Christian social conduct.<p><span class= "bld">Receive him not into your house, neither</span> <span class= "bld">bid him God speed.</span>—These are no terms of ordinary politeness, which the Apostle does not forbid, but terms of close Christian intimacy and spiritual communion, the deliberate cultivation of personal acquaintance, fraternal intercourse. The highest sort of Christian brotherly love—love, that is, in its fulness and truth—can only find reciprocity in the same atmosphere of Christ, on the same basis, and in the same characteristics. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2Corinthians 6:16</a>.)<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Is partaker of his evil deeds.</span>—Condones his false doctrine; puts himself in a position to accept it; shares the guilt of his disloyalty by sympathising with him; and in this way lowers his whole moral standard, doing an injury to “God, Christ, the Church, the truth, individual communities, and his own soul.” If any interpret the exhortations to love in the Epistles of St. John too liberally, or by too low a measure, this passage is a wholesome corrective. In applying this teaching to modern times we should remember (1) that St. John is only speaking of those who deliberately deprave the doctrine of Christ in its great outlines; (2) that there may be much in ourselves, in our systems, in our quarrels, in our incrustations of divine truth, in our want of the sense of proportion in dealing with divine things, which may have hindered others from receiving Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2 John 1:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children </span>— That is, some of thy children; <span class="ital">walking in truth </span>— In a manner agreeable to the gospel.

Amen.">2 John 1:13</a>; and that having conversed with them, and observed their conduct, he had found reason to conclude that they were truly pious, and sound in the faith. After their return home, it seems, he inscribed this letter to them as well as to their mother, and by the commendation which he bestowed on them in it, he no doubt encouraged them much to persevere in the truth. By the joy which this circumstance gave the apostle, was manifested the disposition of a faithful minister of Christ; for such derive great happiness from the faith and holiness of their disciples.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:4-6 It is good to be trained to early religion; and children may be beloved for their parents' sake. It gave great joy to the apostle to see children treading in their parents' steps, and likely in their turn to support the gospel. May God bless such families more and more, and raise up many to copy their example. How pleasing the contrast to numbers who spread irreligion, infidelity, and vice, among their children! Our walk is true, our converse right, when according to the word of God. This commandment of mutual Christian love, may be said to be a new one, in respect of its being declared by the Lord Christ; yet, as to the matter, it is old. And this is love to our own souls, that we obey the Divine commands. The foresight of the decay of this love, as well as of other apostacies, or fallings away, might engage the apostle to urge this duty, and this command, frequently and earnestly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I rejoiced greatly that I found ... - That I learned this fact respecting some of thy children. The apostle does not say how he had learned this. It may have been that he had become personally acquainted with them when they were away from their home, or that he had learned it from others. The word used &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;  heure&#772;ka would apply to either method. Grotius supposed that some of the sons had come to Ephesus on business, and that John had become acquainted with them there.<p>Of thy children walking in truth - That is, true Christians; living in accordance with the truth, for this constitutes the essence of religion.

This is clear from the Greek construction, because:<p>(a) if he had meant to say that he had found them all to be of this description, the sentiment would have been directly expressed, "thy children;" but as it is, some word is necessary to be understood to complete the sense; and,<p>(b) the same thing is demanded by the fact that the participle used ("walking" - &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  peripatountas) is in the accusative case.<p>If he had referred to them all, the participle would have been in the genitive, agreeing with the word "children," (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  to&#772;n peripatounto&#772;n) - Lucke. Whether the apostle means to say that only a part of them had in fact embraced the gospel, or that he had only known that a part of them had done it, though the others might have done it without his knowledge, is not quite clear, though the former supposition appears to be the correct one, for if they had all become Christians it is to be presumed that he would have been informed of it. The probability seems to be that a part of her children only were truly pious, though there is no evidence that the others were otherwise than correct in their moral conduct. If there had been improper conduct in any of her other children, John was too courteous, and too delicate in his feelings, to allude to so disagreeable a circumstance. But "if that pious lady," to use the language of Benson, "had some wicked children, her lot was not unique. Her consolation was that she had some who were truly good.

Now as it is matter of joy and gladness to godly parents when their children walk in the paths of faith, truth, and holiness, so it is also to ministers of the Gospel, as well as to the angels in heaven; it gives them an inward pleasure and joy, and which is not only expressed by them, to such children and their parents, but is also abundant by many thanksgivings unto God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</span><p>(2) This true profession consists both in love towards one another which the Lord has commanded, and also especially in wholesome and sound doctrine, which also is delivered to us: for the commandment of God is a sound and sure foundation both of the rule of conduct and of doctrine, and these cannot be separated from one another,<p>(d) According as the truth directs them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2 John 1:4</a>. The Epistle begins with the assurance of joy at the conduct of those to whom it is addressed. The preface to most of the Pauline Epistles is similar. This verse refers back to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀληθείᾳ</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm" title="And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.">2 John 1:5</a>, on the other hand, to <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐχάρην λίαν</span>] not: “I have greatly rejoiced” (Luther); the aorist is to be kept in its own meaning.

Braune’s observation is erroneous, that “as the article is wanting with <span class="greekheb">περιπατοῦντας</span>, it is not indicated that the other children were not walking <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἈΛ</span></span></span>.” With <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤΕῖΝ ἘΝ</span></span></span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:...">1 John 1:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/3_john/1-3.htm" title="For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth....">3 John 1:3-4</a>, and several other passages.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὝΡΗΚΑ</span></span></span> indicates a previous meeting with the children of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΊΑ</span></span></span>—and hence a previous sojourn of the apostle in the Church to which he is writing; incorrectly, Sander: “I have found as the result of my examination;” the preterite <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΧΆΡΗΝ</span></span></span> does not suit this interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΊΑ</span></span></span> be a proper noun, it remains uncertain where the apostle met with her children.

Not only this uncertainty, but also the circumstance that John does not express himself further about the children who are not walking in the truth, indicates that he is not speaking of a family, but of a Church, which is erroneously disputed by Braune.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘῺς ἘΝΤΟΛῊΝ ἘΛΆΒΟΜΕΝ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΘΏς</span></span></span> (which is not to be taken here, with Ebrard, argumentatively = “because indeed”) does not more particularly define the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤΕῖΝ</span></span></span> in itself, as if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἈΛΗΘΕΊᾼ</span></span></span> were only added adverbially for confirmation = “who in truth walk as,” etc.; but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΏς</span></span></span> refers to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤΕῖΝ ἘΝ ἈΛΗΘ</span></span></span>., and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑ</span></span></span> is Christian truth, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm" title="Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.">2 John 1:3</a>; thus: “<span class="ital">who are walking in the truth, according as we received commandment</span>” (Düsterdieck).

And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.">Mark 14:11</a>). He had been too often disappointed in lads like these (see Introd., p. 155). They had profited by the nurture of their godly home, the best equipment for the battle of life. “No man should ever leave money to his children. It is a curse to them. What we should do for our children, if we would do them the best service we can, is to give them the best training we can procure for them, and then turn them loose in the world without a sixpence to fend for themselves” (Cecil John Rhodes). <span class="greekheb">εὕρηκα</span>, “I have found”. He sits down at once and writes to Kyria. How glad she would be that her lads, far away in the great city were true to their early faith! <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν τέκνων</span>, “some of thy children” (a tenderer word than “sons,” <span class="greekheb">υἱῶν</span>), “members of thy family,” not implying that others had done ill; the lads who had come to Ephesus. <span class="greekheb">περιπατοῦντας</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">ambulantes in veritate, die in der Wahrheit wandeln</span>, “ordering their lives according to the precepts of the Gospel”.

The Occasion of the Epistle<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">4</span>. The Apostle has met with some of the elect lady’s children (or some members of the particular Church addressed), probably in one of his Apostolic visits to some Church in Asia Minor. Their Christian life delighted him and apparently prompted him to write this letter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I rejoiced greatly</span>] Or, <span class="ital">I</span> <span class="bld">have</span> <span class="ital">rejoiced greatly</span>, or perhaps, as R. V., <span class="ital">I</span> <span class="bld">rejoice</span> <span class="ital">greatly</span>, if it is the epistolary aorist, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-26.htm" title="These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.">1 John 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>. The same phrase occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-3.htm" title="For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.">3 John 1:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-8.htm" title="And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.">Luke 23:8</a>. The word for ‘rejoice’ (<span class="greekheb">χαίρω</span>) is cognate with ‘grace’ (<span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>) in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm" title="Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.">2 John 1:3</a></span>. ‘Grace’ is originally ‘that which causes joy’: but there is no connexion between the two words here. Like S. Paul, the Elder leads up to his admonition by stating something which is a cause of joy and thankfulness: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,">Philemon 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>; &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that I found</span>] Better, <span class="ital">that I</span> <span class="bld">have</span> <span class="ital">found</span>, or <span class="bld">because</span> <span class="ital">I</span> <span class="bld">have</span> <span class="ital">found</span>. There is nothing in ‘I have found’ (<span class="greekheb">εὕρηκα</span>) to shew that there had been any <span class="ital">seeking</span> on the part of the Apostle, still less that there had been any <span class="ital">examination</span> as to the rightness of their conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of thy children</span>] This elliptical mode of expression (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν τέκνων</span>) is rather common in S. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-24.htm" title="And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.">John 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-40.htm" title="Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.">John 7:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-17.htm" title="Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?">John 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-9.htm" title="And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.">Revelation 11:9</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-13.htm" title="Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.">1 John 4:13</a>). It is impossible to say whether the expression is a delicate way of intimating that only some of the children were walking in truth, or whether it merely means that the Apostle had fallen in with only some of the children. The expression of affection in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2 John 1:1</a></span> is in favour of the latter supposition; but the strong warnings against intercourse with heretical teachers favours the former: some of her children were already contaminated. ‘Walking’ indicates the activity of human life (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1 John 1:7</a>): ‘in truth’ is in Christian truth, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2 John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm" title="Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.">2 John 1:3</a></span>; in Christian tone and temper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as we have received a commandment</span>] The changes made in R. V., <span class="bld">even as we received commandment</span>, are all improvements in the direction of accuracy. ‘Even as’ (<span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>) points to the completeness of their obedience: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1 John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1 John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm" title="Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.">1 John 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1 John 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>. The aorist points to the definite occasion of their reception of the commandment: comp. ‘heard’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-11.htm" title="For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.">1 John 3:11</a>; and ‘gave’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment....">1 John 3:23-24</a>. ‘Commandment’ is the third key-word of the Epistle, in which it occurs four times. Love, truth, and obedience; these are the three leading ideas, which partly imply, partly supplement one another. Obedience without love becomes servile; love without obedience becomes unreal: neither of them can flourish outside the realm of truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the Father</span>] Literally, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm" title="Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.">2 John 1:3</a></span>, <span class="ital">from the hand of the Father</span> (<span class="greekheb">παρὰ τοῦ Πατρός</span>).

It looks like the idiomatic "epistolary aorist," of which we have had probable instances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-21.htm">1 John 2:21</a> and 26. In this idiom the point of view of the <span class="accented">recipient</span> of the letter is taken instead of that of the writer. In Latin the imperfect is used in a similar way - <span class="accented">scribebam, dabamus</span>; and sometimes the perfect, <span class="accented">scripsi, misi</span>, and the like (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-30.htm">Acts 23:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-11.htm">Philemon 1:11, 19, 21</a>. See Moulton's Winer, page 347). We are probably to understand this verse as a gentle intimation on the part of the elder that he has reason to know that certain others of her children are <span class="accented">not</span> walking in truth. Through the elect lady's too indiscriminate hospitality, some of her children have been seduced by the deceivers who have come to her bringing other doctrine than that of Christ. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Irejoiced<p>Expressions of thankful joy are common in the Pauline salutations.
