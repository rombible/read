Indeed it was in some sense from the beginning of the world; <span class="ital">that we love one another </span>— More abundantly. The apostle does not here speak of <span class="ital">a new commandment </span>in the sense in which our Lord used that phrase <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning....">1 John 2:7-8</a>;) but his meaning is, either that the commandment to love one another, which he gave to this family, was not a commandment which had never been delivered to the church before, or that it was not a commandment peculiar to the gospel. The first of these seems to be the apostle’s meaning; as he tells this matron that the disciples of Christ had had this commandment delivered to them from the beginning. In inculcating mutual love among the disciples of Christ so frequently and so earnestly in all his writings, John showed himself to be, not only a faithful apostle of Christ, but a person of a most amiable and benevolent disposition; his own heart being full of love to all mankind, and particularly to the followers of Jesus, he wished to promote that holy and happy temper in all true Christians.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:4-6 It is good to be trained to early religion; and children may be beloved for their parents' sake. It gave great joy to the apostle to see children treading in their parents' steps, and likely in their turn to support the gospel. May God bless such families more and more, and raise up many to copy their example. How pleasing the contrast to numbers who spread irreligion, infidelity, and vice, among their children! Our walk is true, our converse right, when according to the word of God. This commandment of mutual Christian love, may be said to be a new one, in respect of its being declared by the Lord Christ; yet, as to the matter, it is old. And this is love to our own souls, that we obey the Divine commands. The foresight of the decay of this love, as well as of other apostacies, or fallings away, might engage the apostle to urge this duty, and this command, frequently and earnestly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And now I beseech thee, lady - Dr, "And now I entreat thee, Kyria," (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  kuria.)

John was probably then a very old man; the female to whom the Epistle was addressed was doubtless much younger.<p>Not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee - John presumed that the command to love one another was understood as far as the gospel was known; and he might well presume it, for true Christianity never prevails anywhere without prompting to the observance of this law.

This general command, addressed to all the disciples of the Saviour, John doubtless means to say was as applicable to him and to the pious female to whom he wrote as to any others, and ought to be exercised by them toward all true Christians; and he exhorts her, as he did all Christians, to exercise it. It was a command upon which, in his old age, he loved to dwell; and he had little more to say to her than this, to exhort her to obey this injunction of the Saviour. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.">2 John 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὕτη</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>] The same construction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-3.htm" title="For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.">1 John 5:3</a>. The apostle is not distinguishing the commandment of love from the other commandments (de Wette), but is describing the walking according to the commandments of God as the substance and essence of love; with justice, for, in the first place, only <span class="ital">that</span> love is moral—or more particularly, Christian—in its character which is founded on obedience toward God, and therefore “consists in the fulfilment of the commandments of God that regulate our relationship to our neighbour” (Ebrard); and, in the second place, the aim of all the divine commandments is nothing else than love. Brückner, Braune, and others here interpret <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη</span> incorrectly of “Christian love simply,” including also the love of God and Christ; the close connection of this sentence with the preceding one (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη</span> clearly refers back to <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους</span>) compels us to understand <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγαπή</span> of Christian brotherly love. The thought last expressed is specially emphasized by the following words. According to the reading: <span class="greekheb">αὕτη ἡ ἐντολή ἐστι</span>, we must translate: “<span class="ital">This commandment is</span> (consists in this), <span class="ital">as ye have heard from the beginning</span> (no other than this), <span class="ital">that ye should walk</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῇ</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐντολή</span> resumes the preceding <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ</span>. the transition from the plural to the singular is not difficult; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-22.htm" title="And whatever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight....">1 John 3:22-23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> states the substance of the commandment, and <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῇ</span> refers to <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπῃ</span> (de Wette-Brückner, Lücke, Düsterdieck, Ebrard, Braune), and not to <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> (Sander); for this would not only give an inadmissible tautology, but would also be contrary to John’s mode of expression, in which the phrase: <span class="greekheb">περιπατεῖν ἐν τῇ ἐντολῇ</span>, does not appear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By the intervening clause <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἠκούσατε</span>, “a subordinate definition of the <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span>” (Lücke, de Wette) is not given, but it is observed that the readers have heard from the beginning what is the substance of the divine commandment; the apostle thereby refers back to what was said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm" title="And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.">2 John 1:5</a> (so also Düsterdieck, Ebrard, Brückner, Braune). The circle that results from this interpretation only serves to bring clearly out the identity of brotherly love and obedience toward God.[9]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[9] Köstlin incorrectly interprets (p. 218): “the old commandment, that we should love one another, means nothing else than that we should abide in what He has commanded us to believe.” That <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> here denotes the command to <span class="ital">believe</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1 John 3:23</a>), finds no confirmation in the context.—Ebrard unjustifiably asserts that the obscurity of the expression in this verse is to be explained by the fact that the apostle intentionally alludes to some passages of the First Epistle, with which he assumes the Kyria to be familiar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_john/1-5.htm" title="And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another....">2 John 1:5-6</a>. The Comprehensive Commandment. “And now I ask thee, Kyria, not as writing a new commandment to thee but the one which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this is love—that we walk according to His commandments; this is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning—that we should walk in love,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These counsels are just a summary of the doctrines expounded at large in the first Epistle. There is here a sort of reasoning in a circle: The commandment is Love; Love is walking according to His commandments; His commandments are summed up in one—Love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>5, 6.

John uses the same verb (<span class="greekheb">ἐρωτᾷν</span>) as that used of making request about ‘sin unto death’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-16.htm" title="If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not to death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not to death. There is a sin to death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.">1 John 5:16</a>). It perhaps indicates that he begs as an equal or superior rather than as an inferior. In both passages the Vulgate rightly has <span class="ital">rogo</span>, not <span class="ital">peto</span>. In classical Greek the verb = <span class="ital">interrogo</span>, ‘I ask a question’, a meaning which it frequently has in N. T. S. Paul uses it very seldom, and always in the sense of ‘I request’: his usual word is <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶ</span>, which S.

It is doubtful whether ‘that we love’ depends upon ‘commandment’ or upon ‘I beseech thee’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5–11</span>. We now enter upon the main portion of the Epistle, which has three divisions: <span class="ital">Exhortation to Love and Obedience</span> (5, 6); <span class="ital">Warnings against False Doctrine</span> (7–9); <span class="ital">Warnings against False Charity</span> (10, 11).

Ex<span class="accented">hortation.</span> Having thus stated what has led to his writing, the apostle passes on to the central portion of the letter (verses 5-11), which consists of three exhortations: to love and obedience (verses 5, 6); against false doctrine (verses 7-9); against false charity (verses 10, 11). The transition to this practical part of the Epistle is indicated by the opening particles, "And now." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beseech thee, lady.</span> The verb has, perhaps, a tinge of peremptoriness about it <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span>: "This is a request which I have a right to make." Respecting the "new commandment" and "from the beginning," see notes on 1 John 2:7. We may reasonably suppose that St. John is here reminding her of the contents of his First Epistle. The parallels between this Epistle and the First are so numerous and so close, that we can scarcely doubt that some of them are consciously made.
