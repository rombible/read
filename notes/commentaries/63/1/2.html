And old disciple is honourable; an old apostle and leader of disciples is more so. The letter is to a noble Christian matron, and her children; it is well that the gospel should get among such: some noble persons are called. Families are to be encouraged and directed in their love and duties at home. Those who love truth and piety in themselves, should love it in others; and the Christians loved this lady, not for her rank, but for her holiness. And where religion truly dwells, it will abide for ever. From the Divine Persons of the Godhead, the apostle craves grace, Divine favour, and good-will, the spring of all good things. It is grace indeed that any spiritual blessing should be given to sinful mortals. Mercy, free pardon, and forgiveness; for those already rich in grace, need continual forgiveness. Peace, quietness of spirit, and a clear conscience, in assured reconciliation with God, together with all outward prosperity that is really for good: these are desired in truth and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the truth's sake - They love this family because they love the truth, and see it so cordially embraced and so happily exemplified. Those who love the gospel itself will rejoice in all the effects which it produces in society, on individuals, families, neighborhoods, and their hearts will be drawn with warm affection to the places where its influence is most fully seen.<p>Which dwelleth in us - In us who are Christians; that is, the truths of the gospel which we have embraced. Truth may be said to have taken up a permanent abode in the hearts of all who love religion.<p>And shall be with us for ever - Its abode with us is not for a night or a day; not for a month or a year; not for the few years that make up mortal life; it is not a passing stranger that finds a lodging like the weary traveler for a night, and in the morning is gone to be seen no more; it has come to us to make our hearts its permanent home, and it is to be with us in all worlds, and while ceaseless ages shall roll away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Not for her high birth, nobility, or riches; but either for Christ's sake, who is the truth, and who dwells in the hearts of believers by faith, and who is the same that dwells in one as in another; and on his account it is that saints love one another, because they belong to him, he is formed in them, and his image is stamped upon them; and every like loves its like: or for the Gospel's sake, which has a place, and dwells in every saint, and is the same for matter and substance in one as in another; and unity of mind and judgment produces unity of affection: or for the sake of the truth of grace, the inward principle of grace, which dwells in every regenerate person; a communication of the experience of which knits the saints one to another: <p>and shall be with us for ever; where Christ enters and takes up his abode, from thence he never finally and totally departs, though he may sometimes hide his face with respect to communion, or withdraw his gracious presence; and where the Gospel has once took place in the heart, and is become the ingrafted word, it can never be rooted out, or be removed; and where the truth of grace is, it will remain; it is an incorruptible seed, a well of living water, springing up into eternal life. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div>states the cause of the love<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a> states the cause of the love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν ἀλήθειαν τὴν μένουσαν ἐν ἡμῖν</span>] The idea <span class="greekheb">μένειν</span> signifies here, as in the First Epistle, firm, sure existence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span> the apostle includes the loving and the loved (so also Braune).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾷν ἐν ἀληθείᾳ</span> is based on the possession of the <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Carpzovius incorrectly connects these words with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm" title="Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.">2 John 1:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By the addition: <span class="greekheb">καὶ μεθʼ ἡμῶν ἔσται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</span>, the imperishable endurance of fellowship with the truth is declared (Düsterdieck, Braune), and it is not merely the wish for it that is expressed (Lücke, Ebrard). By <span class="greekheb">μετά</span> (as distinguished from <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>) the objectivity of the truth is indicated (Braune). The irregularity of the construction, inasmuch as the finite verb is used instead of a participle (comp. A. Buttmann, p. 327; Winer, p. 510; VII. p. 533), serves to give prominence to the idea.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">μένουσαν ἐν ἡμῖν</span>, not merely apprehended by the intellect but welcomed by the heart. <span class="greekheb">μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">nobiscum, bei uns</span>, as our guest and companion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">For the truth’s sake</span>] The repetition of the word ‘truth’ is quite in S.

An echo of Christ’s farewell discourses: ‘He shall give you another Advocate, that He may <span class="ital">be with you for ever</span>, even the Spirit of <span class="ital">truth</span>’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>).

The Apostle and all believers love the elect lady and her children on account of the ever-abiding presence of Christ in the gift of the Spirit. ‘For ever’ is literally ‘unto the age’: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-17.htm" title="And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God stays for ever.">1 John 2:17</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀγαπητὲ</span>, <span class="ital">beloved</span>) This expression occurs three times, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm" title="For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.">2 John 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm" title="And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.">2 John 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-11.htm" title="For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.">2 John 1:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">περὶ πάντων</span>, <span class="ital">respecting all things</span>) that which relates to all parts [in all respects].—<span class="greekheb">εὐοδοῦσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to prosper</span>) in property, etc.—<span class="greekheb">ὑγιαίνειν</span>, <span class="ital">to be in health</span>) in body.—<span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span>, <span class="ital">even as</span>) Where the <span class="ital">soul</span> is in health, it is possible for all things to be in health.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>even in addressing illustrious persons, in preference to appellatives. But <span class="ital">the Elder</span> elegantly interposes, between his own name, and that of the lady, a word denoting the spiritual relationship, from which this short Epistle proceeded.
