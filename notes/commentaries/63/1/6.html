This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it....">2 John 1:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">And this is love </span>— The principal proof of true love, first to God, and then to his people; <span class="ital">that we walk after his commandments </span>— That we be obedient to his will in all things. <span class="ital">This </span>love <span class="ital">is the </span>great <span class="ital">commandment, </span>which <span class="ital">ye have heard from the beginning </span>— Of our preaching; that <span class="ital">ye should walk in it </span>— Should persevere in love. <span class="ital">For many deceivers, </span>&c. — See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1 John 4:1</a> : as if he had said, Carefully keep what you have heard from the beginning; for many seducers are come; <span class="ital">who confess not that Jesus Christ is come </span>— Or came, as <span class="greekheb">ερχομενον </span>(considered as the participle of the imperfect) may be rendered; for Jesus Christ was not on earth in the flesh when John wrote this; as the translation in our Bible, <span class="ital">is come, </span>imports. He had come in the flesh, but was gone. So that no translation of this clause, which represents Jesus Christ as then present, can be just. The apostle alludes to the rise of those heretics, who affirmed that Christ came only in appearance; and who, of course, denied his priestly, if not also his prophetic and kingly office. <span class="ital">This </span>— Every one who does this, who does not acknowledge that Christ came in the flesh; <span class="ital">is a deceiver </span>— A seducer from God; <span class="ital">and antichrist </span>— An enemy to Christ.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:4-6 It is good to be trained to early religion; and children may be beloved for their parents' sake. It gave great joy to the apostle to see children treading in their parents' steps, and likely in their turn to support the gospel. May God bless such families more and more, and raise up many to copy their example. How pleasing the contrast to numbers who spread irreligion, infidelity, and vice, among their children! Our walk is true, our converse right, when according to the word of God. This commandment of mutual Christian love, may be said to be a new one, in respect of its being declared by the Lord Christ; yet, as to the matter, it is old. And this is love to our own souls, that we obey the Divine commands. The foresight of the decay of this love, as well as of other apostacies, or fallings away, might engage the apostle to urge this duty, and this command, frequently and earnestly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments - This is the proper expression or evidence of love to God.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-3.htm" title="For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.">1 John 5:3</a>. The Apostle has no sympathy with a religion of pious emotions: there must be a <span class="ital">persevering walk according to God’s commands</span>. In writing to a woman it might be all the more necessary to insist on the fact that love is not a mere matter of feeling.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This is the commandment</span>] Or, as before, <span class="ital">The commandment is this</span>, i.e. consists in this. We had a similar transition from plural to singular, ‘commandments’ to ‘commandment’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-22.htm" title="And whatever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight....">1 John 3:22-23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In these verses (5, 6) S. John seems to be referring to the First Epistle, which she would know.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as ye have heard</span>] Better, as R.

R. V. is also more accurate in placing ‘that’ after, instead of before, ‘even as ye heard’. But A. V. is not wrong, for ‘even as ye heard’ belongs to the apodosis, not to the protasis: still, this is interpretation rather than translation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye should walk in it</span>] In brotherly love; not, in the commandment, as the Vulgate implies. S. John speaks of walking <span class="ital">in</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>) truth, <span class="ital">in</span> light, <span class="bld"><span class="ital">in</span></span> darkness; but of walking <span class="ital">according to</span> (<span class="greekheb">κατά</span>) the commandments. S. Paul speaks both of walking <span class="bld"><span class="ital">in</span></span> love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>) and <span class="ital">according to</span> love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-15.htm" title="But if your brother be grieved with your meat, now walk you not charitably. Destroy not him with your meat, for whom Christ died.">Romans 14:15</a>). Neither speaks of walking <span class="bld"><span class="ital">in</span></span> commandments: and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-6.htm" title="And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.">Luke 1:6</a> a different verb is used.

Just as in the sphere of thought truth must be combined with love (see on verse 3), so in the sphere of emotion love must be combined with obedience. Warm feelings, whether towards God or towards man, are worse than valueless if they are not united, on the one hand with obedience, on the other with truth.
