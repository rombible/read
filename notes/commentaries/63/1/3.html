And old disciple is honourable; an old apostle and leader of disciples is more so. The letter is to a noble Christian matron, and her children; it is well that the gospel should get among such: some noble persons are called. Families are to be encouraged and directed in their love and duties at home. Those who love truth and piety in themselves, should love it in others; and the Christians loved this lady, not for her rank, but for her holiness. And where religion truly dwells, it will abide for ever. From the Divine Persons of the Godhead, the apostle craves grace, Divine favour, and good-will, the spring of all good things. It is grace indeed that any spiritual blessing should be given to sinful mortals. Mercy, free pardon, and forgiveness; for those already rich in grace, need continual forgiveness. Peace, quietness of spirit, and a clear conscience, in assured reconciliation with God, together with all outward prosperity that is really for good: these are desired in truth and love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grace be unto you ... - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>. This salutation does not differ from those commonly employed by the sacred writers, except in the emphasis which is placed on the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is "the Son of the Father." This is much in the style of John, in all of whose writings he dwells much on the fact that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, and on the importance of recognizing that fact in order to the possession of true religion.

Only it is added here with respect to Christ, that he is <p>the Son of the Father in truth and love; which is mentioned by the apostle to confirm the deity of Christ, which is plainly implied in wishing for the above things equally from him, as from the Father; and to oppose and confront some heretics of those times, who denied the true and proper sonship of Christ; and therefore he calls him, "the Son of the Father", the only begotten of the Father; and that "in truth", or truly and properly, and not in a figurative and metaphorical sense, as magistrates are called the sons of God, and children of the most High, by reason of their office; but so is not Christ, he is God's own Son, in a true, proper, and natural sense: and he is so "in love"; he is his well beloved Son, his dear Son, the Son of his love; as he cannot otherwise be; since he is not only the image of him, but of the same nature, and has the same perfections with him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Grace be with you, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in<p>(c) truth and love.</span><p>(c) With true knowledge which always has love united with it, and following it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm" title="Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.">2 John 1:3</a>. The formula of greeting. It agrees substantially with that which is found in most of the N. T. Epistles; the prefixed <span class="greekheb">ἔσται μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>), however, is peculiar; the future indicates the wish as a certain expectation, which is based on the immediately preceding statement (Düsterdieck). If we take the reading <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> (see the critical notes), the apostle includes himself along with the readers of the Epistle, which indeed does not elsewhere occur in the salutatory formulae; <span class="greekheb">μετά</span> = “with.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>] just as in 1 and 2 Tim. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm" title="To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.">Titus 1:4</a>.[7]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παρὰ Θεοῦ πατρός</span>] Instead of <span class="greekheb">παρά</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> is elsewhere regularly used in this connection, as <span class="greekheb">א</span> reads here also; on the difference of the two prepositions, see Winer, p. 326; VII. p. 342.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ πατρός</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> is always added by Paul, except in the Pastoral Epistles.

Grotius wrongly defines the relationship when he says: per cognitionem veri et dilectionem mutuam, nam per haec in nos Dei beneficia provocamus, conservamus, augemus; in the first place, <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not = per; and, in the second place, our conduct is not the cause of the divine <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΆΡΙς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, but the relationship is the converse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[7] The explanation of these words given on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-2.htm" title="To Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Timothy 1:2</a> is regarded as unsatisfactory by Düsterdieck, although it is in substantial agreement with his own, only that it is not expressly stated that <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> means “grace,” <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος</span> “mercy,” and <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span> “peace,”—which is surely self-evident,—but only the relation of the three ideas to one another, which is often erroneously interpreted, is pointed out.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm" title="Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.">2 John 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἔσται μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span>, not a wish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1 Peter 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-2.htm" title="Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,">2 Peter 1:2</a>) but a confident assurance. <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> the well-spring in the heart of God; <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος</span>, its outpourings; <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>, its blessed effect.

It is not so much a prayer or a blessing, as the confident assurance of a blessing; and the Apostle includes himself within its scope. This triplet of heavenly gifts occurs, and in the same order, in the salutations to Timothy (both Epistles) and Titus. The more common form is ‘grace and peace’. In Judges 2 we have another combination; ‘mercy, peace, and love’. In secular letters we have simply ‘greeting’ (<span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span>) instead of these Christian blessings. ‘Grace’ is the <span class="ital">favour</span> of God towards sinners (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>); ‘mercy’ is the <span class="ital">compassion</span> of God for the misery of sinners; ‘peace’ is the result when the guilt and misery of sin are removed. ‘Grace’ is rare in the writings of S. John; elsewhere only <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace....">John 1:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm" title="John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-21.htm" title="The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-50.htm">Luke 1:50</a>. The pre-Christian definitions of the word include the element of grief experienced on account of the unworthy suffering of another. So Aristotle. The Latin misericordia (miser "wretched," cor "the heart") carries the same idea. So Cicero defines it, the sorrow arising from the wretchedness of another suffering wrongfully. Strictly speaking, the word as applied to God, cannot include either of these elements, since grief cannot be ascribed to Him, and suffering is the legitimate result of sin. The sentiment in God assumes the character of pitying love. Mercy is kindness and goodwill toward the miserable and afflicted, joined with a desire to relieve them. Trench observes: "In the Divine mind, and in the order of our salvation as conceived therein, the mercy precedes the grace. God so loved the world with a pitying love (herein was the mercy), that He gave His only-begotten Son (herein the grace), that the world through Him might be saved. But in the order of the manifestation of God's purposes of salvation, the grace must go before the mercy and make way for it. It is true that the same persons are the subjects of both, being at once the guilty and the miserable; yet the righteousness of God, which it is quite as necessary should be maintained as His love, demands that the guilt should be done away before the misery can be assuaged; only the forgiven may be blessed. He must pardon before He can heal.... From this it follows that in each of the apostolic salutations where these words occur, grace precedes mercy" ("Synonyms of the New Testament").<p>With you<p>The best texts read with us.<p>From God - from Jesus Christ (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Note the repeated preposition, bringing out the twofold relation to the Father and Son.
