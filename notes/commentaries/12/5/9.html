The prophet had “a messenger” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-10.htm" title="And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.">2Kings 5:10</a>) at his command.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/5-9.htm" title="So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha....">2 Kings 5:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Naaman stood at the door of the house of Elisha — </span>Waiting for Elisha’s coming to him. <span class="ital">And Elisha sent a messenger, </span>&c. — Which he did partly to try and exercise Naaman’s faith and obedience; partly for the honour of his religion and ministry, that it might appear he sought not his own glory and profit, but only God’s honour and the good of men; and partly for the manifestation of the almighty power of God, which could cure such a desperate disease by such slight means.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-14 Elisha knew Naaman to be a proud man, and he would let him know, that before the great God all men stand upon the same level. All God's commands make trial of men's spirits, especially those which direct a sinner how to apply for the blessings of salvation. See in Naaman the folly of pride; a cure will not content him, unless he be cured with pomp and parade. He scorns to be healed, unless he be humoured. The way by which a sinner is received and made holy, through the blood, and by the Spirit of Christ, through faith alone in his name, does not sufficiently humour or employ self, to please the sinner's heart. Human wisdom thinks it can supply wiser and better methods of cleansing. Observe, masters should be willing to hear reason. As we should be deaf to the counsel of the ungodly, though given by great and respected names, so we are to have our ears open to good advice, though brought by those below us. Wouldst thou not do any thing? When diseased sinners are content to do any thing, to submit to any thing, to part with any thing, for a cure, then, and not till then, is there any hope of them. The methods for the healing of the leprosy of sin, are so plain, that we are without excuse if we do not observe them. It is but, Believe, and be saved; Repent, and be pardoned; Wash, and be clean. The believer applies for salvation, not neglecting, altering, or adding to the Saviour's directions; he is thus made clean from guilt, while others, who neglect them, live and die in the leprosy of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He shall know ...

When the Syrian general, with his imposing retinue, arrived at the prophet's house, Elisha sent him a message to "go and wash in Jordan seven times." This apparently rude reception to a foreigner of so high dignity incensed Naaman to such a degree that he resolved to depart, scornfully boasting that the rivers of Damascus were better than all the waters of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Waiting for Elisha’s coming to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Naaman came with his horses, and with his chariot,....

For though the Hebrew word is singular, the sense is ‘chariotry’, i.e., a number of chariots.

The Hyksos, who introduced horses and chariots into Egypt, though not exactly a Syrian people, entered Egypt from Syria; and in all the Syrian wars of the Egyptians, which began about  <span class="date">B.C. 1600</span>, we find their adversaries employing a chariot force. In one representation of a fight between the Egyptians and a people invading Egypt from' Syria, the war-chariots of the latter are drawn by four oxen; but generally the horse was used on both sides. Syria imported her horses and chariots from Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>), and, as appears from this passage, employed them for peaceful as well as for warlike purposes. There was a similar employment of them from a very early time in Egypt (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-9.htm">Genesis 50:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And stood at the door of the house of Elisha</span>. Elisha was at this time residing in Samaria, whether in his own house or not we cannot say. His abode was probably a humble one; and when the great general, accompanied by his cavalcade of followers, drew up before it, he had, we may be sure, no intention of dismounting and entering. What he expected he tells us himself in ver. 11. The prophet regarded his pride and self-conceit as deserving of a rebuke. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And in Naaman's house before his wife, i.e., in her service, there was an Israelitish maiden, whom the Syrians had carried off in a marauding expedition (&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: they had gone out in (as) marauding bands).
