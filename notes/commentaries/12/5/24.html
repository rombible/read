There would be no window in the exterior wall from which Gehazi and his companions might have been observed approaching. Perhaps, however, a fortified hill, forming part of the system of defences surrounding Samaria, like the Ophel at Jerusalem, is to be understood. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm" title="He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.">2Chronicles 27:3</a>.)

Elisha, a holy prophet, a man of God, has but one servant, and he proves a base liar. The love of money, that root of all evil, was at the bottom of Gehazi's sin. He thought to impose upon the prophet, but soon found that the Spirit of prophecy could not be deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the Holy Ghost. It is folly to presume upon sin, in hopes of secrecy. When thou goest aside into any by-path, does not thy own conscience go with thee? Does not the eye of God go with thee? He that covers his sin, shall not prosper; particularly, a lying tongue is but for a moment. All the foolish hopes and contrivances of carnal worldlings are open before God. It is not a time to increase our wealth, when we can only do it in such ways as are dishonourable to God and religion, or injurious to others. Gehazi was punished. If he will have Naaman's money, he shall have his disease with it. What was Gehazi profited, though he gained two talents, when thereby he lost his health, his honour, his peace, his service, and, if repentance prevented not, his soul for ever? Let us beware of hypocrisy and covetousness, and dread the curse of spiritual leprosy remaining on our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tower - Rather, "the hill," the well-known hill by Elisha's house.

The word (Heb., <span class="ital">Ophel</span>) is often used in connexion with the description of the wall of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm" title="He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm" title="Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/3-26.htm" title="Moreover the Nethinims dwelled in Ophel, to the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lies out....">Nehemiah 3:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-21.htm" title="But the Nethinims dwelled in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.">Nehemiah 11:21</a>). From its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-8.htm" title="And you, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.">Micah 4:8</a>, of Mount Zion, the sense ‘hill’ rather than ‘tower’ appears well established. The margin of A.V., has here ‘secret place’ as also the LXX., but that seems to have come from connecting the word with a root of slightly different consonants (<span class="greekheb">אפל</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">עפל</span>). The question arises: What hill is meant? And it appears best to understand it of some eminence near the house of Elisha. All Samaria was hilly in character (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-24.htm" title="And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.">1 Kings 16:24</a>). The narrative by this allusion to a locality, as though it were well known, shews its historic character, and appears to go back in its early form to close upon the date of the events.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he took them from their hand</span>] Though they were heavy enough for two men, yet he must contrive to carry them himself that he may attract less notice, and run no risk of being found out.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he came to the tower</span>; rather, to <span class="accented">the hill</span> (Revised Version). Some well-known eminence at a little distance from the Damascus gate of Samaria must be intended. Here Gehazi stopped the slaves, and took the money from them. It was important for his purpose that they should not be seen re-entering the city, as that would have occasioned remark, and might naturally have led to inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">He took</span> them - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the bags - <span class="cmt_word">from their hand</span>  <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> from the hands of Naaman's servants  - <span class="cmt_word">and bestowed</span> them <span class="cmt_word">in the house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by himself or deputy brought them to Elisha's house, and there hid them away. <span class="cmt_word">And he let the men</span> - Naaman's servants - go, <span class="cmt_word">and they departed.</span> They hastened, no doubt, to rejoin their master. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then Naaman said: &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, "and not"  equals  and if not, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769; (lxx; not "and O," according to Ewald, 358, b., Anm.), "let there be given to thy servant ( equals  to me) two mules' burden of earth (on the construction see Ewald, 287, h.), for thy servant will no more make (offer) burnt-offerings and slain-offerings to any other gods than Jehovah. May Jehovah forgive thy servant in this thing, when my lord (the king of Syria) goeth into the house of Rimmon, to fall down (worship) there, and he supports himself upon my hand, that I fall down (with him) in the house of Rimmon; if I((thus) fall down in the house of Rimmon, may," etc. It is very evident from Naaman's explanation, "for thy servant," etc., that he wanted to take a load of earth with him out of the land of Israel, that he might be able to offer sacrifice upon it to the God of Israel, because he was still a slave to the polytheistic superstition, that no god could be worshipped in a proper and acceptable manner except in his own land, or upon an altar built of the earth of his own land. And because Naaman's knowledge of God was still adulterated with superstition, he was not yet prepared to make an unreserved confession before men of his faith in Jehovah as the only true God, but hoped that Jehovah would forgive him if he still continued to join outwardly in the worship of idols, so far as his official duty required. Rimmon (i.e., the pomegranate) is here, and probably also in the local name Hadad-rimmon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>), the name of the supreme deity of the Damascene Syrians, and probably only a contracted form of Hadad-rimmon, since Hadad was the supreme deity or sun-god of the Syrians (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>), signifying the sun-god with the modification expressed by Rimmon, which has been differently interpreted according to the supposed derivation of the word. Some derive the name from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, as the supreme god of heaven, like the &#x395;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; of Sanchun. (Cler., Seld., Ges. thes. p. 1292); others from &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, a pomegranate, as a faecundantis, since the pomegranate with its abundance of seeds is used in the symbolism of both Oriental and Greek mythology along with the Phallus as a symbol of the generative power (vid., Bhr, Symbolik, ii. pp. 122,123), and is also found upon Assyrian monuments (vid., Layard, Nineveh and its Remains, p. 343); others again, with less probability, from &#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, jaculari, as the sun-god who vivifies and fertilizes the earth with his rays, like the &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;; and others from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  Arab. rmm, computruit, as the dying winter sun (according to Movers and Hitzig; see Leyrer in Herzog's Cyclopaedia). - The words "and he supports himself upon my hand" are not to be understood literally, but are a general expressly denoting the service which Naaman had to render as the aide-de-camp to his king (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-17.htm">2 Kings 7:17</a>). For the Chaldaic form &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, see Ewald, 156, a. - In the repetition of the words "if I fall down in the temple of Rimmon," etc., he expresses the urgency of his wish.</body></html>
