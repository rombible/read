Such is the correct language of Scripture, while those who write common history, plainly show that God is not in all their thoughts. No man's greatness, or honour, can place him our of the reach of the sorest calamities of human life: there is many a sickly, crazy body under rich and gay clothing. Every man has some but or other, something that blemishes and diminishes him, some allay to his grandeur, some damp to his joy. This little maid, though only a girl, could give an account of the famous prophet the Israelites had among them. Children should be early told of the wondrous works of God, that, wherever they go, they may talk of them. As became a good servant, she desired the health and welfare of her master, though she was a captive, a servant by force; much more should servants by choice, seek their masters' good. Servants may be blessings to the families where they are, by telling what they know of the glory of God, and the honour of his prophets. Naaman did not despise what she told, because of her meanness. It would be well if men were as sensible of the burden of sin as they are of bodily disease. And when they seek the blessings which the Lord sends in answer to the prayers of his faithful people, they will find nothing can be had, except they come as beggars for a free gift, not as lords to demand or purchase.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Six thousand pieces of gold - Rather, "six thousand shekels of gold." Coined money did not exist as yet, and was not introduced into Judea until the time of Cyrus. Gold was carried in bars, from which portions were cut when need arose, and the value was ascertained by weighing. If the gold shekel of the Jews corresponded, as some think, to the doric of the Persians, the value of the 6,000 shekels would be about 6,837 British pounds If the weight was the same as that of the silver shekel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a> note), the value would exceed 12,000 British pounds.<p>The ancient practice of including clothes among gifts of honor in the East <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a> continues to the present day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. ten talents of silver&#8212;&pound;3421; 6000 shekels of gold; a large sum of uncertain value.<p>ten changes of raiment&#8212;splendid dresses, for festive occasions&#8212;the honor being thought to consist not only in the beauty and fineness of the material, but on having a variety to put on one after another, in the same night.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The king of Israel; </span> Jehoram the son of Ahab, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-1.htm" title="Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.">2 Kings 3:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will send a letter unto the king of Israel, </span> desiring him to obtain this favour from the prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold; </span> partly for the charges of his journey; and partly for presents to the prophet, or others, as he saw fit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king of Syria said, go to, go,....

The two nations were at peace, as we see from verse 7, where Jehoram expresses his dread of a quarrel. The tone of the king of Israel seems to be that of one who feared Syria, and for that reason wanted to avoid a rupture.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the king of Israel</span>] The king is not named, but it seems likely that the activity of Elisha was mainly in the reign of Jehoram, Ahab’s son.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and took with him ten talents of silver</span>] At this early date there was no coined money. The silver and the gold were in bars and were paid away by weight. A talent of silver is said to have been worth about £375, and gold was about ten times the value of silver.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">six thousand</span> pieces <span class="ital">of gold</span>] In phrases like this when the Hebrew expression is given fully, the inserted word is usually ‘shekels’, which the R.V. puts on the margin. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-25.htm" title="So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.">1 Chronicles 21:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>. But the shekel was in these days only a weight, as indeed the word signifies; thus we have not only shekels of gold, but shekels of silver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-8.htm" title="And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.">1 Samuel 9:8</a>); shekels of brass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm" title="And he had an helmet of brass on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.">1 Samuel 17:5</a>); and shekels of iron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm" title="And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.">1 Samuel 17:7</a>). When the shekel came to be a coin, the shekel of gold was worth about £2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ten changes of raiment</span>] Especially valued in the East, and often included in summaries of wealth, and among costly presents. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-22.htm" title="To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-24.htm" title="And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.">2 Chronicles 9:24</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Syria said, Go to, go</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Go</span>, <span class="accented">depart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lose no time; go at once, if there is any such possibility as the maiden has indicated. "We see," Bahr says, "from the king's readiness, how anxious he was for the restoration of Naaman." <span class="cmt_word">And I will send a letter unto the King of Israel.</span> Letters had been interchanged between Solomon and Hiram, King of Tyro (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3-11</a>), a century earlier; and the communications of king with king in the East, though sometimes carried on orally by ambassadors, probably took place to a large extent by means of letters from a very early date. Written communications seem to have led to the outbreak of the war by which the foreign dynasty of the Hyksos was driven out of Egypt, and the native supremacy reestablished ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. it. pp. 199, 200). Written engagements were certainly entered into between the Egyptian kings and the Hittites at a date earlier than the Exodus (ibid., pp. 291, 310). Benhadad evidently regards the sending of a letter to a neighboring monarch as a natural and ordinary occurrence. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Naaman - <span class="cmt_word">departed, and took with him ten talents of silver</span> - reckoned by Keil as equal to 25,000 thalers, or &pound;3750; by Thenius as equal to 20,000 thalers, or &pound;3000 - <span class="cmt_word">and six thousand pieces of gold.</span> "Pieces of gold" did not yet exist, since coin had not been invented. Six thousand shekels' weight of gold is probably intended. This would equal, according to Keil, 50,000 thalers (&pound;7500); according to Thenius, 60,000 thalers (&pound;9000). Such sums are quite within the probable means of a rich Syrian nobleman of the time, a favorite at court, and the generalissimo of the Syrian army. Naaman evidently supposed that he would have, directly or indirectly, to purchase his cure. And ten changes of raiment (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; Hom., 'Od.,' 13:67; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:2. &sect; 8; ' Anab.,' 1:2. &sect; 29; etc.). The practice of giving dresses of honor as presents continues in the East to this day. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Feeding of a Hundred Pupils of the Prophets with Twenty Barley Loaves. - A man of Baal-Shalisha (a place in the land of Shalisha, the country to the west of Gilgal, Jiljilia; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>) brought the prophet as first-fruits twenty barley loaves and &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, i.e., roasted ears of corn (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>), in his sack (&#1510;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., sack or pocket). Elisha ordered this present to be given to the people, i.e., to the pupils of the prophets who dwelt in one common home, for them to eat; and when his servant made this objection: "How shall I set this (this little) before a hundred men?" he repeated his command, "Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus hath the Lord spoken: They will eat and leave" (&#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; &#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;, infin. absol.; see Ewald, 328, a.); which actually was the case. That twenty barley loaves and a portion of roasted grains of corn were not a sufficient quantity to satisfy a hundred men, is evident from the fact that one man was able to carry the whole of this gift in a sack, and still more so from the remark of the servant, which shows that there was no proportion between the whole of this quantity and the food required by a hundred persons. In this respect the food, which was so blessed by the word of the Lord that a hundred men were satisfied by so small a quantity and left some over, forms a type of the miraculous feeding of the people by Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-16.htm">Matthew 14:16</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-36.htm">2 Kings 15:36-37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11-12</a>); though there was this distinction between them, that the prophet Elisha did not produce the miraculous increase of the food, but merely predicted it. The object, therefore, in communicating this account is not to relate another miracle of Elisha, but to show how the Lord cared for His servants, and assigned to them that which had been appropriated in the law to the Levitical priests, who were to receive, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4-5</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>, the first-fruits of corn, new wine, and oil. This account therefore furnishes fresh evidence that the godly men in Israel did not regard the worship introduced by Jeroboam (his state-church) as legitimate worship, but sought and found in the schools of the prophets a substitute for the lawful worship of God (vid., Hengstenberg, Beitrr. ii. S. 136f.). </body></html>
