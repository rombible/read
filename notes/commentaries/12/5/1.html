The Midrash makes Naaman the man who “drew the bow at a venture” on that occasion. The “deliverance” was victory over Israel.<p><span class= "bld">He was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">and the man was a brave warrior, stricken with leprosy</span>. His leprosy need not have been so severe as to incapacitate him for military duties.

Such is the correct language of Scripture, while those who write common history, plainly show that God is not in all their thoughts. No man's greatness, or honour, can place him our of the reach of the sorest calamities of human life: there is many a sickly, crazy body under rich and gay clothing. Every man has some but or other, something that blemishes and diminishes him, some allay to his grandeur, some damp to his joy. This little maid, though only a girl, could give an account of the famous prophet the Israelites had among them. Children should be early told of the wondrous works of God, that, wherever they go, they may talk of them. As became a good servant, she desired the health and welfare of her master, though she was a captive, a servant by force; much more should servants by choice, seek their masters' good. Servants may be blessings to the families where they are, by telling what they know of the glory of God, and the honour of his prophets. Naaman did not despise what she told, because of her meanness. It would be well if men were as sensible of the burden of sin as they are of bodily disease. And when they seek the blessings which the Lord sends in answer to the prayers of his faithful people, they will find nothing can be had, except they come as beggars for a free gift, not as lords to demand or purchase.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria - An Assyrian monarch had pushed his conquests as far as Syria exactly at this period, bringing into subjection all the kings of these parts.

The cure of Naaman’s leprosy (Not in Chronicles)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">honourable</span>] An attempt is made by the LXX. to translate literally the Hebrew expression which is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-3.htm" title="The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.">Isaiah 3:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">τεθαυμασμένος προσώπῳ</span>, ‘admired in the eyes of’. The idea is the passive of ‘an acceptor of persons’. Hence ‘one accepted and acceptable’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because by him the Lord had given deliverance</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">victory</span>. That the Lord was the deliverer is the thought of the Jewish writer. The Syrians would have put the case differently. It is however a matter of interest to note that Jehovah was not regarded by the compiler of this narrative as exclusively the God of the Jews, nor the Gentiles thought to be beyond, or deprived of, His care. He helps them though they know Him not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">deliverance unto Syria</span>] That Naaman was the man ‘who drew a bow at a venture’ and smote Ahab at Ramoth Gilead, and thus gained victory for Syria, is a conjecture of Jewish commentators for which there is not the smallest foundation. About this time the Assyrians invaded Syria and the countries round about, and it is not improbable that this was the war in which Naaman had gained his fame.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a mighty</span> man <span class="ital">in</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">of</span>] <span class="ital">valour</span>] The phrase occurs many times, and nowhere but here is the preposition ‘in’ used, but always ‘of’. The disease with which Naaman was afflicted must have been of a less malignant character than leprosy mostly is, otherwise he would have been physically incapable of soldierly duties.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a leper</span>] The laws of the Jews concerning the separation of lepers from the rest of the people are given in Leviticus 13, 14, and are extremely stringent. Clearly in Syria there were no such regulations, for Naaman goes with the host to war, returns and lives at home with his wife and the household, and attends on the king when he goes to worship in the house of Rimmon.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Naaman, captain of the host of the King of Syria.</span> The name "Naaman" is here found for the first time. It is thought to be derived from that of an Aramaean god (Ewald), and appears in the later Arabic under the form of <span class="accented">Noman</span>, in which shape it is familiar to the students of Arabian history. Benhadad, who had been wont in his youth and middle age to lead his armies into the field in person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>; 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 103), seems now in his old age to have found it necessary to entrust the command to a general, and to have made Naaman captain of his host. Compare the similar practice (ibid., p. 101) of the Assyrian monarchs. <span class="cmt_word">Was a great man with his master, and honorable</span> - rather, honor<span class="accented">ed</span>, or <span class="accented">held in esteem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x2c;</span> LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">because by him the Lord had given deliverance</span> - literally, <span class="accented">salvation</span>, or <span class="accented">safety</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">unto Syria.</span> Probably he had commanded the Syrian army in some of its encounters with the Assyrians, who at this time, under Shalmaneser II., were threatening the independence of Syria, but did not succeed in subjecting it. <span class="cmt_word">He was also a mighty man in valor</span> <span class="accented">- gibbor hail</span>, commonly translated in our version by "mighty man of valor," does not mean much more than "a good soldier" - but he was <span class="cmt_word">a leper.</span> Leprosy had many degrees. Some of the lighter kinds did not incapacitate a man for military service, or unfit him for the discharge of court duties (ver. 18). But there was always a danger that the lighter forms might develop into the severer ones. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>One (of these pupils) then went to the field to gather vegetables (&#1488;&#1512;&#1514;, olera: for the different explanations of this word see Celsii Hierobot. i. 459ff., and Ges.

The reason for this decision is, that the peculiarity mentioned answers to the etymon &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;, to split, in Syr. and Chald. to crack. Nevertheless the rendering given by the old translators is apparently the more correct of the two; for the colocynths also belong to the genus of the cucumbers, creep upon the ground, and are a round yellow fruit of the size of a large orange, and moreover are extremely bitter, producing colic, and affecting the nerves. The form of this fruit is far more suitable for oval architectural ornaments (&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-18.htm">1 Kings 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-24.htm">1 Kings 7:24</a>) than that of the wild cucumber.</body></html>
