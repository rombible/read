Such is the correct language of Scripture, while those who write common history, plainly show that God is not in all their thoughts. No man's greatness, or honour, can place him our of the reach of the sorest calamities of human life: there is many a sickly, crazy body under rich and gay clothing. Every man has some but or other, something that blemishes and diminishes him, some allay to his grandeur, some damp to his joy. This little maid, though only a girl, could give an account of the famous prophet the Israelites had among them. Children should be early told of the wondrous works of God, that, wherever they go, they may talk of them. As became a good servant, she desired the health and welfare of her master, though she was a captive, a servant by force; much more should servants by choice, seek their masters' good. Servants may be blessings to the families where they are, by telling what they know of the glory of God, and the honour of his prophets. Naaman did not despise what she told, because of her meanness. It would be well if men were as sensible of the burden of sin as they are of bodily disease. And when they seek the blessings which the Lord sends in answer to the prayers of his faithful people, they will find nothing can be had, except they come as beggars for a free gift, not as lords to demand or purchase.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He rent his clothes - The action indicated alarm and terror quite as much as sorrow <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a>.<p>Consider, I pray you - Jehoram speaks to his chief officers, and bids them mark the animus of the Syrian monarch.

And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.">2 Kings 2:12</a> above and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm" title="And Reuben returned to the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.">Genesis 37:29</a>; sometimes as here, of horror and alarm.

Cf. for the language <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm" title="See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>, ‘I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me, I kill and I make alive’. So also in Hannah’s song (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-6.htm" title="The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.">1 Samuel 2:6</a>). This is a power that belongs to God only.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">doth send unto me</span>] The knowledge of Elisha’s mighty acts must have been less before the mind of the king than of his subjects, or he would not have failed to see that the request might be granted by God through his prophet. ‘Himself with the two other kings had been eyewitnesses of what Elisha could do, yet now the calves of Dan and Bethel have so often taken up his heart that there is no room for the memory of Elisha. Whom he sued to in his extremity, now his prosperity hath forgotten. Carnal hearts when need drives them can think of God and his prophet: when their turn is served, can as utterly forget them as if they were not’ (Bp Hall).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he seeketh a quarrel against me</span>] The verb, in this form and sense, only occurs here, but the cognate noun in the sense of ‘an occasion of quarrel’ is found <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-4.htm" title="But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.">Jdg 14:4</a>. Hence the R.V. has put ‘occasion’ on the margin. It is only the one who feels his superiority that ventures on seeking a quarrel, and from the timid words of Jehoram we may conclude that he thought the Syrians more than a match for him; as was only natural, since they had defeated his father at Ramoth-Gilead not long before. He dreaded a renewal of such a conflict.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the King of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes.</span> In horror and alarm (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-24.htm">Jeremiah 36:24</a>). He concluded that once more (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>) the Syrian monarch was determined to find a ground of quarrel, and had therefore sent to him an impossible request. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive?</span> To "kill" and to "make alive" were familiar expressions in the mouth of the Israelites to designate omnipotence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-6.htm">1 Samuel 2:6</a>).

Elisha's early miracles were mostly wrought with a certain amount of secrecy. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</span> The king misjudged Benhadad, but not without some grounds of reason, if he was ignorant of Elisha's miraculous gifts. Benhadad, when seeking a ground of quarrel with Ahab, had made extravagant requests (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-3.htm">1 Kings 20:3-6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Curing of Naaman from Leprosy. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-1.htm">2 Kings 5:1</a>. Naaman, the commander-in-chief of the Syrian king, who was a very great man before his lord, i.e., who held a high place in the service of his king and was greatly distinguished (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-14.htm">Isaiah 9:14</a>), because God had given the Syrians salvation (victory) through him, was as a warrior afflicted with leprosy. The &#1493; has not dropped out before &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1506;, nor has the copula been omitted for the purpose of sharpening the antithesis (Thenius), for the appeal to Ewald, 354, a., proves nothing, since the passages quoted there are of a totally different kind; but &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is a second predicate: the man was as a brave warrior leprous. There is an allusion here to the difference between the Syrians and the Israelites in their views of leprosy. Whereas in Israel lepers were excluded from human society (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13</a> and 14), in Syria a man afflicted with leprosy could hold a very high state-office in the closest association with the king.</body></html>
