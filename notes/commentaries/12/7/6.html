The tract of north Syria between the Euphrates and the Orontes was the cradle of the Hittite race, and it was over this that these kings of the several tribes bore sway. In the thirteenth century (B.C. ) their power extended over great part of Asia Minor, as rock inscriptions prove. Carchemish, Kadesh, Hamath, and Helbon (<span class= "ital">Aleppo</span>) were their capitals. Rameses II. made a treaty of peace with <span class= "ital">Heta-sira</span>, the prince of the Hittites. In the time of Tiglath Pileser I. (B.C. 1120), the Hittites were still paramount from the Euphrates to the Lebanon. Shalmaneser II. mentions a Hittite prince, Sapalulme, king of the <span class= "ital">Patinâa</span>, a tribe on the Orontes.

Little is known of the state of Egypt at this time (towards the close of the twenty-second dynasty). The Syrians were seized with panic, under the idea that they were about to be attacked on all sides at once. Some such wild rumour as that expressed by the words of the text must have been spread through the camp; but we need not press the <span class= "ital">literal</span> accuracy of the statement, for who was there to report the exact nature of the alarm to the historians of Israel? Moreover, it is evident from the style of the narrative in chapters 6 and 7 that it rests upon <span class= "ital">oral tradition</span>, so that it would be a mistake to press subordinate details. Prof. Robertson Smith considers that the sudden retreat of the Syrians is explained by the fact that the <span class= "ital">Assyrians</span> were already pressing upon them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2 Kings 7:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord had made the host of the Syrians hear a noise of chariots, </span>&c. — The air, by the ministry of angels, doubtless, was put into such a motion about the camp of the Syrians, as to give sounds like to those it would have given if it had been agitated by the rattling of chariots, the prancing of horses, and all the other motions and actions of a numerous army and their attendants: so that the Syrians could not well draw any other conclusion than that an exceeding large army was marching against them and was just at hand, as they heard exactly the same noise as if it had been actually so. Some have supposed that it was not the air which was influenced, or acted upon, in this miracle, but the ears of the Syrians: if so, the work was the more wonderful, for in that case there must have been as many distinct miracles wrought as there were individuals that heard the noise. In either way their hearing was imposed upon, just as the sight of those that besieged Dothan had been imposed on: for God knows how to work upon any and every sense, pursuant to his own counsels. <span class="ital">They said,</span> <span class="ital">Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites — </span>Under which name, as elsewhere under the name of Amorites, seem to be comprehended all, or any of the people of Canaan.

Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to report the good tidings to others.

Hence, the supposition of the Syrians was far from improbable.<p>The kings of the Hittites - The Hittites, who are found first in the south <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>, then in the center of Judea <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>, seem to have retired northward after the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites. They are found among the Syrian enemies of the Egyptians in the monuments of the 19th dynasty (about 1300 B.C.), and appear at that time to have inhabited the valley of the Upper Orontes. In the early Assyrian monuments they form a great confederacy, as the most powerful people of northern Syria, dwelling on both banks of the Euphrates, while at the same time there is a second confederacy of their race further to the south, which seems to inhabit the anti-Lebanon between Hamath and Damascus. These southern Hittites are in the time of Benhadad and Hazael a powerful people, especially strong in chariots; and generally assist the Syrians against the Assyrians. The Syrians seem now to have imagined that these southern Hittites had been hired by Jehoram.<p>The kings of the Egyptians - This is a remarkable expression, since Egypt elsewhere throughout Scripture appears always as a centralised monarchy under a single ruler. The probability is that the principal Pharaoh had a prince or princes associated with him on the throne, a practice not uncommon in Egypt. The period, which is that of the 22nd dynasty, is an obscure one, on which the monuments throw but little light. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots&#8212;This illusion of the sense of hearing, whereby the besiegers imagined the tramp of two armies from opposite quarters, was a great miracle which God wrought directly for the deliverance of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To hear a noise; </span> either in the air; or rather, in their ears; otherwise the Samaritans had heard it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Hittites</span> under which name (as elsewhere under the name of the Amorites) he seems to understand all or any of the people of Canaan.

We need not enquire how it was brought about, for we are not told, nor intended to know. The report of what had alarmed the host would come to the knowledge of the Israelites in time, and they could only say, ‘It is the Lord’s doing, and is marvellous in our eyes’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath hired against us</span>] Instances of such mercenary service are found elsewhere in the Bible narrative. Thus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.">2 Samuel 10:6</a>) ‘the children of Ammon sent and <span class="ital">hired</span> the Syrians of Beth-rehob &c.’ And Amaziah, king of Judah, <span class="ital">hired</span> valiant men out of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-6.htm" title="He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.">2 Chronicles 25:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the kings of the Hittites</span>] In the Bible we first meet with the Hittites as one among several nations whose land God promised to Abraham and his seed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-20.htm" title="And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,">Genesis 15:20</a>). Next they are mentioned as dwelling near Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-4.htm" title="I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burial plot with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.">Genesis 23:4</a>), and from them Abraham buys a burial-place for Sarah, which is afterwards spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-9.htm" title="And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;">Genesis 25:9</a>) as in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar <span class="ital">the Hittite</span>.

The Hittites are among the enemy whom Israel overcame at the taking of Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm" title="And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.">Joshua 24:11</a>), and they are part of the host conquered at the waters of Merom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-4.htm" title="And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is on the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.">Joshua 11:4</a>).

Uriah the Hittite was among David’s captains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-39.htm" title="Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.">2 Samuel 23:39</a>), and Hittite women were among the wives of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:">1 Kings 11:1</a>).

Yet in profane literature this people, evidently very wide-extended and powerful, are unmentioned, and it is only the modern deciphering of the records of Egypt and Babylon which has given us a conception of the Hittite power. Thence we learn that from very early times they were in conflict with Egypt, and that one of their chief towns, Kadesh on the river Orontes, was the scene of several contests between the Hittites and the Egyptians. Their other chief city is found to have been Carchemish on the Euphrates, so that the description of their territory in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm" title="From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.">Joshua 1:4</a> is seen to be utterly correct, and we can understand how the hiring of such a mighty enemy would be sure to alarm Benhadad. For particulars of the inscriptions which relate to the Hittites see <span class="ital">Records of the Past</span> 2:161; 2:61; 5:6, &c. and Dr Wright’s <span class="ital">Empire of the Hittites</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the kings of the Egyptians</span>] Large districts of Egypt, called by Greeks, Nomes, were under distinct organization though owning allegiance to the Pharaoh. It is very probable that at various periods there were two if not three kingdoms in the land. Hence the Assyrians speak of the <span class="ital">kings</span> that had been hired out of Egypt. If this had been the case then Ben-hadad and his army would have been shut in both on the north and on the south. We need not wonder at the terror such a thought inspired. The plural ‘kings’ of the Egyptians may perhaps here be used vaguely, as ‘princes’ of Babylon is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-31.htm" title="However, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>, when only Berodach-baladan is in question.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, voice, is used for noises of any kind (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-4.htm">Psalm 93:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-13.htm">Ezekiel 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-2.htm">Nahum 3:2</a>), though generally for those in which the human voice preponderated.

How the noise was produced it is impossible to say. Na-rural causes are insufficient; and the writer evidently regards the event as miraculous: "The <span class="accented">Lord had made</span> the host of the Syrians to hear a noise," etc. Nothing can be more weak and irrelevant than to remark, with Bahr," There are instances, even nowadays, that people in certain mountainous regions regard a rushing and roaring sound, such as is sometimes heard there, as a sign of coming war." The Syrians thought they heard the actual arrival of a vast army. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Lo, the King of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites.</span> This supposition has been thought "strange," almost inexplicable. "No such nation as the Hittites any longer existed," says Mr. Sumner ('The Books of the Kings,' vol. 2. p. 72, Eng. trans.). But the Assyrian records of the  <span class="date">ninth and eighth centuries B.C.</span> make it evident, not only that the Hittites still existed at that date, but that they were among the most powerful enemies of the Ninevite kings, being located in Northern Syria, about Carchemish (Jerabus) and the adjacent country. It is also apparent that they did not form a centralized monarchy, but were governed by a number of chiefs, or "kings," twelve of whom are mentioned in one place (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 112). It was no very improbable supposition on the part of the Syrians that Jehoram had called in the aid of the Hittite confederacy, and that they had marched an army to his assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the Egyptians.</span> "The plural, kings of the Egyptians," says Keil, "is not to be pressed. It is probably occasioned only by the parallel expression,' kings of the Hittites.'" But Egyptian history shows us that about this date Egypt was becoming disintegrated, and that two or three distinct dynasties were sometimes ruling at the same time, in different parts of the country - one at Bubastis another at Thebes, a third at Tanis, occasionally a fourth at Memphis (see "Ancient Egypt," in 'The Story of the Nations,' p. 311). The writer thus shows a knowledge of the internal condition of Egypt which we should not have expected. To come upon us; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to fall upon us from the north and from the south at the same time. In their panic, the Syrians did not stop to weigh probabilities, or to think how unlikely it was that such a simultaneous attack could have been arranged between powers so remote one from the other. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The elders of the city were assembled together in Elisha's house, probably to seek for counsel and consolation; and the king sent a man before him (namely, to behead the prophet); but before the messenger arrived, the prophet told the elders of the king's intention: "See ye that this son of a murderer (Joram, by descent and disposition a genuine son of Ahab, the murderer of Naboth and the prophets) is sending to cut off my head?" and commanded them to shut the door against the messenger and to force him back at the door, because he already heard the sound of his master's feet behind him. These measures of Elisha, therefore, were not dictated by any desire to resist the lawful authorities, but were acts of prudence by which he delayed the execution of an unrighteous and murderous command which had been issued in haste, and thereby rendered a service to the king himself. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-33.htm">2 Kings 6:33</a> we have to supply from the context that the king followed close upon the messenger, who came down to Elisha while he was talking with the elders; and he (the king) would of course be admitted at once. For the subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is not the messenger, but the king, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>. The king said: "Behold the calamity from the Lord, why shall I wait still further for the Lord?" - the words of a dispairing man, in whose soul, however, there was a spark of faith still glimmering. The very utterance of his feelings to the prophet shows that he had still a weak glimmer of hope in the Lord, and wished to be strengthened and sustained by the prophet; and this strengthening he received. </body></html>
