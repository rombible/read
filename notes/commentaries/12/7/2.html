Or we may render, “Behold, Jehovah is going to make windows in the sky [<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to pour down provisions upon us]. Can this thing come to pass?” In any case, the tone is that of scoffing unbelief. Reuss renders, with French point, “Voyez donc. Iaheweh en fera pleuvoir!

Here we see, as we have often seen elsewhere, that unbelief of God’s declarations and promises is a sin whereby men both greatly displease him, and deprive themselves of the favours he designed for them. The murmuring Israelites saw Canaan, but could not enter in because of unbelief. “Such,” says Bishop Patrick, “will be the portion of those who believe not the promise of eternal life; they shall see it at a distance, but never taste it.” Take care, reader, that this be not thy case! that <span class="ital">a promise being left </span>thee <span class="ital">of entering into his rest, </span>thou do <span class="ital">not fall short of it.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1,2 Man's extremity is God's opportunity of making his own power to be glorious: his time to appear for his people is when their strength is gone. Unbelief is a sin by which men greatly dishonour and displease God, and deprive themselves of the favours he designed for them. Such will be the portion of those that believe not the promise of eternal life; they shall see it at a distance, but shall never taste of it. But no temporal deliverances and mercies will in the end profit sinners, unless they are led to repentance by the goodness of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A lord - Rather, "the captain," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>; etc. The term itself, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  sha&#770;l&#305;&#770;ysh (derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;  sha&#770;lo&#770;sh, "three,") may be compared with the Latin "tribunus."<p>Windows - Rather, "sluices" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>).

This is the usual rendering except in this narrative. The same change is made by R.V. in verses 17 and 19. The word is originally the title of some military officer. Hence the greater fitness of ‘captain’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on whose hand the king leaned</span>] For the expression cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm" title="In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.">2 Kings 5:18</a>, where Naaman describes himself as attending in this capacity.

But the sense is hypothetical. Literally the words are ‘Behold the Lord [is] making &c.’ This is said in derision. Almost as if the captain had said, ‘I suppose then the Lord is going to make &c.’ and then he follows his scorn with a question. ‘Even then, could [R.V. <span class="bld">might</span>] this thing be?’ For ‘windows of heaven’ cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm" title="In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.">Genesis 7:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou shalt see</span> it <span class="ital">with thine eyes</span>] The answer to this mocking captain would be as hard for him to comprehend as was the promise of abundance which he was deriding. He, a person in close attendance on the king, to see the store which was promised and not partake of it was inconceivable. Doubtless his mockery grew louder still.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lord</span>, or <span class="accented">the captain</span>, as the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> is commonly translated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-9.htm">2 Chronicles 8:9</a>).

But the officer on whose arm he leans is not so reticent. Utterly incredulous, he expresses his incredulity in a scoffing way: "Could this possibly be, even if God were to 'make windows in heaven,' as he did at the time of the Flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), and pour through them, instead of rain, as then, a continual shower of fine meal and corn?" Disbelief is expressed, not only in the prophetic veracity of Elisha, but in the power of God. Hence Elisha's stern reply. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</span> At once a threat and a warning. If the thing was to be, and the lord to see it and yet not profit by it, the only reasonable conclusion was that his death was imminent. He was thus warned, and given time to "set his house in order," and to repent and make his peace with the Almighty. Whether he took advantage of the warning, or even understood it, we are not told. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the king was passing by upon the wall to conduct the defence, a woman cried to him for help; whereupon he replied: &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1498; &#1497;&#1497;, "should Jehovah not help thee, whence shall I help thee? from the threshing-floor or from the wine-press?"

Thenius gives a simpler explanation, namely, that it is a subjective negation and the sentence hypothetical, so that the condition would be only expressed by the close connection of the two clauses (according to Ewald, 357). "From the threshing-floor or from the wine-press?" i.e., I can neither help thee with corn nor with wine, cannot procure thee either food or drink. He then asked her what her trouble was; upon which she related to him the horrible account of the slaying of her own child to appease her hunger, etc.</body></html>
