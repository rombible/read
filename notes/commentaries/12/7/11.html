The Syriac has, “And the porters drew near, and told the house of the king.”<p><span class= "bld">And they told it.</span>—The king’s palace may have been near to the ramparts. If not, the sentries at the gate shouted their news to other soldiers near them, who conveyed it to the palace. The word “within” seems to indicate the former. (The Authorised Version, which is Kimchi’s rendering, cannot be right, because in that case the Hebrew verb would require the preposition “unto,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-10.htm" title="So they came and called to the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.">2Kings 7:10</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:3-11 God can, when he pleases, make the stoutest heart to tremble; and as for those who will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shaking of a leaf. Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to report the good tidings to others. From love to him, not from selfish feelings, they will gladly share their earthly good things with their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They called unto the porter ... and told them - The word "porter" is used like our "guard" and the meaning here is, not that the lepers called to any particular individual, but that they roused the body of men who were keeping guard at one of the gates. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were&#8212;The uniform arrangement of encampments in the East is to place the tents in the center, while the cattle are picketed all around, as an outer wall of defense; and hence the lepers describe the cattle as the first objects they saw.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The porters; </span> either his fellow porters of the city; or rather, the porters or guards of the gate of the king’s house. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he called the porters,....

Golgatha, p. 205, and Tobler, Denkbltter aus Jerus. p. 411ff.). These men being on the point of starvation, resolved to invade the camp of the Syrians, and carried out this resolution &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, in the evening twilight, not the morning twilight (Seb. Schm., Cler., etc.), on account of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-12.htm">2 Kings 7:12</a>, where the king is said to have received the news of the flight of the Syrians during the night. Coming to "the end of the Syrian camp," i.e., to the outskirts of it on the city side, they found no one there. For (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-7.htm">2 Kings 7:7</a>) "the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and horses, a noise of a great army," so that, believing the king of Israel to have hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to fall upon them, they fled from the camp in the twilight &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, with regard to their life, i.e., to save their life only, leaving behind them their tents, horses, and asses, and the camp as it was. - The miracle, by which God delivered Samaria from the famine or from surrendering to the foe, consisted in an oral delusion, namely, in the fact that the besiegers thought they heard the march of hostile armies from the north and south, and were seized with such panic terror that they fled in the greatest haste, leaving behind them their baggage, and their beasts of draught and burden. It is impossible to decide whether the noise which they heard had any objective reality, say a miraculous buzzing in the air, or whether it was merely a deception of the senses produced in their ears by God; and this is a matter of no importance, since in either case it was produced miraculously by God. The kings of the Hittites are kings of northern Canaan, upon Lebanon and towards Phoenicia; &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in the broader sense for Canaanites, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>. The plural, "kings of the Egyptians," is probably only occasioned by the parallel expression "kings of the Hittites," and is not to be pressed. </body></html>
