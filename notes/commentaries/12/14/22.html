Amaziah perhaps had not vigorously prosecuted the conquest of Edom, having been greatly weakened by his defeat in the struggle with Jehoash. He may even have suffered some further losses at the hands of the Edomites; and this, as Thenius supposes may have led to the conspiracy which brought about his death and the accession of his son. The warlike youth Uzziah took the field at once, and pushed his victorious arms to the southern extremity of Edom, the port of Elath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm" title="Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD.

Uzziah's re-establishment of the place, rendered possible by his father's successes <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>, was one of his first acts, and seems to imply a desire to renew the commercial projects which Solomon had successfully carried out, and which Jehoshaphat had vainly attempted <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

It is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm" title="And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.">1 Kings 9:26</a> to have belonged to Edom, but at this time Judah was powerful enough to secure a road through Edom for trade purposes, and so extend the sway of their kingdom to the same point southward which they had occupied in the days of Solomon. Between that time and this, Elath had most likely fallen into decay. Hence the mention of ‘building’, which of course means restoration. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-35.htm" title="However, the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.">2 Kings 15:35</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and restored it to Judah</span>] As it had been in the days of Solomon. We need not suppose that more was done than to secure a passage through Edom between Elath and Jerusalem. Edom was of small use to Judah, but a port on the Red Sea was a great acquisition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after that the king slept with his fathers</span>] This is another of those vague notices which indicate an unusual state of things in Judah at this period. It would almost seem as though Azariah had been put in authority, if not on the throne, before the death of his father, and that he had been making his plans beforehand, only waiting for his father’s death to carry them out. He was without doubt a popular monarch, for it is said (verse 21) that all Judah agreed on him for king.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He built Elath, and restored it to Judah.</span> On the position of Elath, or Eloth, and its importance, see the comment on 1 Kings 9:26. It had been the headquarters of Solomon's fleet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), and again of Jehoshaphat's (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>); but had been, of course, recovered by the Edomites when they revolted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>). Azariah's re-occupation seems to imply an intention on his part of, renewing the old Red Sea trade. By "built ' in this passage we must understand "rebuilt" or (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>) "fortified." <span class="cmt_word">After that the king slept with his fathers.</span> Keil is probably right in understanding this to mean "immediately after he had ascended the throne," or "as soon as ever his father was dead" (see the comment on ver. 19). His further military successes will be considered in the comment on his reign, as sketched in the next chapter. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The repetition of the notice concerning the end of the reign of Joash, together with the formula from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-12.htm">2 Kings 13:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-13.htm">2 Kings 13:13</a>, may probably be explained from the fact, that in the annals of the kings of Israel it stood after the account of the war between Jehoash and Amaziah. This may be inferred from the circumstance that the name of Joash is spelt invariably &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; here, whereas in the closing notices in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-12.htm">2 Kings 13:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-13.htm">2 Kings 13:13</a> we have the later form &#1497;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, the one which was no doubt adopted by the author of our books. But he might be induced to give these notices once more as he found them in his original sources, from the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-17.htm">2 Kings 14:17</a>, that Amaziah outlived Jehoash fifteen years, seeing therein a manifestation of the grace of God, who would not destroy Amaziah notwithstanding his pride, but delivered him, through the death of his victor, from further injuries at his hands. As Amaziah ascended the throne in the second year of the sixteen years' reign of Jehoash, and before his war with Israel made war upon the Edomites and overcame them, the war with Israel can only fall in the closing years of Jehoash, and this king cannot very long have survived his triumph over the king of Judah.</body></html>
