This king has recorded his exaction of tribute from Tyre and Sidon, “the land of Omri” (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Israel), Edom, and Philistia; and a siege of Damascus, followed by the submission of Mari’, its king, and the spoiling of his palace. The prostration of his enemy thus accounts for the permanent success of Jeroboam, who was himself a vassal of Assyria.<p><span class= "bld">He recovered.</span>—This verb was rendered “lie restored” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm" title="He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.">2Kings 14:25</a>, and that is the meaning here.<p><span class= "bld">Damascus and Hamath.</span>—Not the entire states so named, which were powerful independent communities, but portions of their territory, which had belonged to Israel in the days of Solomon. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/8-3.htm" title="And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.">2Chronicles 8:3-4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Which belonged to Judah.</span>—This is really an epithet restrictive of the phrase, “Damascus and Hamath,” the sense being, “<span class= "ital">Judœan</span> Damascus and Hamath.” (Comp, the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-1.htm" title="In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.">2Kings 15:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For Israel.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">in Israel</span>. The sense is obscure; but the particle “in” appears to refer to the <span class= "ital">re-incorporation</span> of the Damascene and Hamathite districts with Israel. Ewald would cancel “which belonged to Judah,” and read “to Israel” (so the Syriac and Arabic. But the LXX., Vulg., and Targum support the existing text.) Others explain: He <span class= "ital">restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to the theocratic people) <span class= "ital">through Israel </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the northern kingdom, to which the recovered districts were actually annexed). No explanation, however, is really satisfactory. It may be that by an oversight the Judæan editor wrote” to Judah, “instead of” to Israel and that some scribe added a marginal note “in Israel,” which afterwards crept into the text. It is curious to find certain districts of Hamath leagued with Azariah, king of Judah, against Tiglath Pileser.

It is a sign that God has not cast off his people, if he continues faithful ministers among them. Two reasons are given why God blessed them with those victories: 1. Because the distress was very great, which made them objects of his compassion. 2. Because the decree was not yet gone forth for their destruction. Many prophets there had been in Israel, but none left prophecies in writing till this age, and their prophecies are part of the Bible. Hosea began to prophesy in the reign of this Jeroboam. At the same time Amos prophesied; soon after Micah, then Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah. Thus God, in the darkest and most degenerate ages of the church, raised up some to be burning and shining lights in it; to their own age, by their preaching and living, and a few by their writings, to reflect light upon us in the last times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He recovered Damascus - Jeroboam probably gained certain advantages over Benhadad, which induced the latter to make his submission and consent to such terms as those extorted by Ahab <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>.<p>Hamath was probably among the actual conquests of Jeroboam.

While God granted him so great a measure of national prosperity and eminence, the reason is expressly stated (2Ki 14:26, 27) to be that the purposes of the divine covenant forbade as yet the overthrow of the kingdom of the ten tribes (see 2Ki 13:23).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Damascus and Hamath</span> were cities of Syria, but were taken from the Syrians by David and Solomon, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts.

And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2 Samuel 8:6</a>) that garrisons were placed in Damascus by David, and that the Syrians became servants to David. Having been once in the possession of the Israelites, the reconquest by Jeroboam II. may be spoken of as a recovery. A sort of occupation of Damascus was also granted by Ben-hadad to Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-34.htm" title="And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.">2 Chronicles 8:4</a> we learn that Solomon built ‘store cities’ in Hamath. The revolt of the ten tribes gave Hamath a chance of freedom again, of which the people probably availed themselves, and remained independent till the conquest by Jeroboam here spoken of. This event brought the city into the hand of Israel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath.</span> It has been suggested that these words mean no more than that Jeroboam took territory from Damascus and Hamath - from Damascus the trans-Jordanic territory which Hazael had conquered from Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>); from Hamath some small portion of the Coele-Syrian valley, about the head-streams of the Orontes and Litany (so Keil and Bahr). But there does not seem to be any sufficient reason for giving the words used this narrow signification. Damascus was conquered and annexed by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>), and held for a time even by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), of whose kingdom Hamath also seems to have formed part (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>). The word "recovered" is, therefore, a suitable one. The prophecy of Amos, no doubt, represents Damascus as independent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3, 4</a>); but this may have been written before Jeroboam conquered it. Hamath's subjection seems to be implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2, 14</a>. We may, therefore, well understand, with Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 124) and Dr. Pusey ('Minor Prophets,' pp, 157, 209), that Jeroboam . ' subdued Damascus and even <span class="accented">Hamath</span>," and added them to his kingdom. How long the subjection continued is a different question. Probably, in the troubles that followed the death of Zachariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10-14</a>), the yoke was thrown off. In the Assyrian Inscriptions, Damascus appears under its own king about  <span class="date">B.C. 786</span> (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 115), and it was certainly independent in  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>. At the latter date Hamath also appears as the capital of an independent kingdom (ibid., pp. 118, 120) under its own monarch. <span class="cmt_word">Which belonged to Judah.</span> Keil and Bahr render,"Hamath <span class="accented">of</span> Judah," regarding <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> as a genitive. Ewald proposes to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "Hamath of Zobah" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3</a>), or else to cut out <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5d4;</span> altogether. The passage is one of great difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">For Israel.</span> It is questionable whether this meaning can be obtained from the present text, which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. Bahr thinks that it can; but Ewald regards the change into <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> as one "of necessity." Might we not avoid all these alterations by translating simply - " how he recovered Damascus and Hamath to Judah <span class="accented">through</span> Is<span class="accented">rael"</span>? Attaching them to Israel was a sort of recovering of them to Judah, to which (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Judah of David and Solomon) they had once belonged. <span class="cmt_word">Are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Immediately after his ascent of the throne, Uzziah built, i.e., fortified, Elath, the Idumaean port (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), and restored it to Judah again. It is evident from this that Uzziah completed the renewed subjugation of Edom which his father had begun. The position in which this notice stands, immediately after his ascent of the throne and before the account of the duration and character of his reign, may be explained in all probability from the importance of the work itself, which not only distinguished the commencement of his reign, but also gave evident of its power. </body></html>
