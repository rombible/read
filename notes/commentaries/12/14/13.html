Thenius thinks the formal specification of Amaziah’s descent indicates that this narrative was derived from “the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.” At all events, it emphasises the importance of the incident, which is further indicated in the original by the order of the words: “And Amaziah king of Judah . . . did Jehoash king of Israel take . . .”<p><span class= "bld">Came.</span>—So the Hebrew margin. The Hebrew text has, <span class= "ital">brought him</span> (<span class= "ital">way’bî’ô;</span> a rare form). So Chronicles and the Vulg., but not the other versions. Jehoash brought Amaziah a prisoner to his own capital.<p><span class= "bld">Brake down the wall.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">made a breach in the wall.</span> No resistance appears to have been offered. Josephus relates that Amaziah was induced by menaces of death to order the gates to be thrown open to the enemy; a needless assumption, considering that the army had been routed and the king was a captive. He adds, that Jehoash rode in his chariot through the breach in the walls, leading Amaziah as a prisoner.<p><span class= "bld">From the gate.</span>—So Chronicles and the <span class= "ital">Syriac,</span> Vulg., and Arabic here. The Hebrew text <span class= "ital">has, at the gate</span>, which is due to the common confusion of the letters <span class= "ital">b</span> and <span class= "ital">m</span> (<span class= "ital">be, “in;” min,</span> “from”). The following “unto” shows that “from” is right.<p><span class= "bld">Of Ephraim.</span>—This gate lay on the north side of the city, and was also called the “Gate of Benjamin.” It answers to the modern Damascus gate.<p><span class= "bld">The corner gate.</span>—This gate was at the north-west corner of the wall at the point where it trended southwards.<p><span class= "bld">Four hundred cubits.</span>—That is, about 222 yards. The insolence of a victorious enemy is sufficient to account for this conduct of Jehoash. It was also a forcible way of convincing Amaziah that even his strongest city was not proof against the prowess of <span class= "ital">Ephraim.</span> Thenius thinks that Jehoash wanted to make room for the triumphal entry of his troops.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/14-13.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits....">2 Kings 14:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jehoash took Amaziah king of Judah, </span>&c. — Amaziah’s pedigree comes in here somewhat abruptly. <span class="ital">The son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah — </span>Because perhaps he had gloried in the dignity of his ancestors, or now smarted for their iniquity. <span class="ital">And came to Jerusalem — </span>Which tamely opened to him; probably because he demanded entrance in Amaziah’s name, and with his consent. <span class="ital">And brake down the wall of Jerusalem — </span>In reproach to them; and that he might, when he pleased, take possession of the royal city.

After Asa's time, it suffered more by the friendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meet with hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to hear two proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify and undervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excites contentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to those who are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin in private life; but when they arise between princes, they become the misery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of his challenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is in the heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, the occasion, whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented, or the like, but their own hearts do it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The object of breaking down the wall was to leave Jerusalem at the mercy of her rival; and it must have been among the conditions of the peace that the breach thus made should not be repaired.<p>Gates in Oriental cities are named from the places to which they lead. The gate of Ephraim must therefore have been a north gate: perhaps also known, later on, by the name of the "gate of Benjamin" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>. The corner gate was probably a gate at the northwest angle of the city, where the north wall approached the Valley of Hinnom. The entire breach was thus in the north wall, on the side where Jerusalem was naturally the weakest. Josephus says that Joash drove his chariot through the breach into the town, a practice not unusual with conquerors. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-14. But Amaziah would not hear&#8212;The sarcastic tenor of this reply incited the king of Judah the more; for, being in a state of judicial blindness and infatuation (2Ch 25:20), he was immovably determined on war. But the superior energy of Joash surprised him ere he had completed his military preparations. Pouring a large army into the territory of Judah, he encountered Amaziah in a pitched battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Then having marched to Jerusalem [2Ki 14:13], he not only demolished part of the city walls, but plundered the treasures of the palace and temple. Taking hostages to prevent any further molestation from Judah, he terminated the war. Without leaving a garrison in Jerusalem, he returned to his capital with all convenient speed, his presence and all his forces being required to repel the troublesome incursions of the Syrians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Came to Jerusalem; </span> commanding entrance in Amaziah’s name, and with his consent, which he durst not deny. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The gate of Ephraim; </span> which led to Ephraim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Four hundred cubits; </span> which was done, partly in scorn and contempt, and partly that he might re-enter and retake it, if they should attempt to renew the war. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh,....

And there is some difficulty in deciding what became of Amaziah at this time and afterwards. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-23.htm" title="And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2 Chronicles 25:23</a> it is added that Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem, and the <span class="ital">Kethib</span> (= they came) in this verse is intended to give that idea. Both A.V. and R.V. have translated the <span class="ital">Keri</span> (= he came). Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> IX. 9. 3) has given an account which makes Amaziah be brought as a captive into his own capital. ‘When the troops (of Judah) were scattered in alarm, Amaziah was left alone and was taken prisoner by the enemy. Then Jehoash threatened to put him to death unless he persuaded the people of Jerusalem to open their gates and admit him with his army into the city. And Amaziah through necessity and in fear for his life caused the enemy to be received. And Jehoash having broken down about four hundred cubits of the walls, drove in his chariot through the opening into Jerusalem, bringing Amaziah as his prisoner.’ This is a picture in which the imagination has added to the details of the sacred narrative. Yet the very formal way in which Amaziah is mentioned in this verse, both here and by the Chronicler, as ‘Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah’, seems to indicate that some crisis in the reign of this king is marked by the defeat at Beth-shemesh. Perhaps he was kept a prisoner till the death of Jehoash. The way in which it is said in verse 17 that Amaziah <span class="ital">lived</span> (not <span class="ital">reigned</span>) after the death of Jehoash, seems also, from its unusual nature, to mark an exceptional state of things.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the gate of Ephraim</span>] This portion of the wall was on the north of the city, opening towards the kingdom of Israel, and the demolition of a large part of the wall on that side was meant to leave the city exposed to the entry of the Israelites if they were desirous to come in. The gate was where now is ‘the Damascus gate’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash King of Israel took Amaziah King of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah at Beth-shemesh</span>  - Josephus says (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) that Amaziah was deserted by his troops, who were seized with a sudden panic and fled from the field - <span class="cmt_word">and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem.</span> According to Josephus, Joash threatened his prisoner with death unless the gates of Jerusalem were opened to him, and his army admitted into the town; and it was upon Amaziah's representations that the surrender was made as soon as the Israelite army appeared before the place. The breach in the wall was therefore not the result of siege operations, but the act of a conqueror, who desired to leave his enemy as defenseless as possible. <span class="cmt_word">From the gate of Ephraim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the main gate in the northern wall of the city - that by which travelers ordinarily proceeded into the territory of the tribe of Ephraim. In later times it seems to have been called indifferently "the gate of Ephraim" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>) and "the gate of Benjamin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>). The great north road, which passed through it, led across the Benjamite into the Ephraim-its territory. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the corner gate.</span> The, "corner gate" is generally thought to have been that at the north-western angle of the City wall, where it turned southward, but this is perhaps doubtful. The exact line of the city wall in the time of Amaziah is exceedingly uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Four hundred cubits</span>; six hundred feet, or two hundred yards. This seems to have been the entire distance between the two gates. As there were at least thirteen gates in the circuit of the walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-31.htm">Nehemiah 12:31-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>), which were probably not mere extensive than those of the present town (3960 yards), the distance of two hundred yards between one gate and another would not be improbable, the <span class="accented">average</span> distance being about three hundred yards. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brief account of the defeat of the Edomites in the Salt Valley and of the taking of the city of Sela is completed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-6.htm">2 Chronicles 25:6-16</a>. According to the latter, Amaziah sought to strengthen his own considerable army by the addition of 100,000 Israelitish mercenaries; but at the exhortation of a prophet he sent the hired Israelites away again, at which they were so enraged, that on their way home they plundered several of the cities of Judah and put many men to death. The Edomites had revolted from Judah in the reign of Joram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>.); Amaziah now sought to re-establish his rule over them, in which he was so far successful, that he completely defeated them, slaying 10,000 in the battle and then taking their capital, so that his successor Uzziah was also able to incorporate the Edomitish port of Elath in his own kingdom once more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>). On the Salt Valley (&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495; for &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495; in the Chronicles), a marshy salt plain in the south of the Dead Sea, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-12.htm">2 Chronicles 25:12</a> of the Chronicles, in addition to the 10,000 who were slain in battle, 10,000 Edomites were taken prisoners and cast headlong alive from the top of a rock. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; (the rock) with the article, because the epithet is founded upon the peculiar nature of the city, was probably the capital of the Edomites, called by the Greeks &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, and bore this name from its situation and the mode in which it was built, since it was erected in a valley surrounded by rocks, and that in such a manner that the houses were partly hewn in the natural rock. Of this commercial city, which was still flourishing in the first centuries of the Christian era, splendid ruins have been preserved in a valley on the eastern side of the ghor which runs down to the Elanitic Gulf, about two days' journey from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, on the east of Mount Hor, to which the Crusaders gave the name of vallis Moysi, and which the Arabs still call Wady Musa (see Robinson, Pal. ii. pp. 512ff., and for the history of this city, pp. 574ff., and Ritter's Erdkunde, xiv. pp. 1103ff.).</body></html>
