After Asa's time, it suffered more by the friendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meet with hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to hear two proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify and undervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excites contentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to those who are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin in private life; but when they arise between princes, they become the misery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of his challenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is in the heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, the occasion, whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented, or the like, but their own hearts do it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Glory of this ... - literally, "Be honored;" i. e.

Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah&#8212;People in the East very often express their sentiments in a parabolic form, especially when they intend to convey unwelcome truths or a contemptuous sneer. This was the design of the admonitory fable related by Joash in his reply. The thistle, a low shrub, might be chosen to represent Amaziah, a petty prince; the cedar, the powerful sovereign of Israel, and the wild beast that trampled down the thistle the overwhelming army with which Israel could desolate Judah. But, perhaps, without making so minute an application, the parable may be explained generally, as describing in a striking manner the effects of pride and ambition, towering far beyond their natural sphere, and sure to fall with a sudden and ruinous crash. The moral of the fable is contained in 2Ki 14:10.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Glory of this; </span> content thyself with that glory and success, and let not thine ambition betray thee to ruin. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up,....

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-14.htm" title="Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-20.htm" title="That his heart be not lifted up above his brothers, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the middle of Israel.">Deuteronomy 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-2.htm" title="Son of man, say to the prince of Tyrus, Thus said the Lord GOD; Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the middle of the seas; yet you are a man, and not God, though you set your heart as the heart of God:">Ezekiel 28:2</a>.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> where the A.V. has ‘contend not with them’, and in verses 5 and 19 of the same chapter, where the same word occurs, the R.V. has adopted ‘contend’ instead of ‘meddle’. The order is there given in respect of those nations whom the Israelites are charged to let alone. Hence in this verse R.V. has on the margin ‘provoke not calamity’. Calamity is thus viewed as an enemy, with whom Amaziah was unwisely venturing to go to war.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast indeed smitten Edom</span> (see ver. 7, and the comment), <span class="cmt_word">and thine heart hath lifted thee up</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, made thee proud, exalted thee above measure - <span class="cmt_word">glory of this, and tarry at home</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, rest content with the glory which thou hast gained in thy Edomite war; make thy boast thereof, but do not affront fresh dangers - <span class="cmt_word">for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt</span> - literally, <span class="accented">why wilt thou meddle with misfortune</span>? <span class="accented"> - <span class="cmt_word"></span>that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</span> Joash was as confident of success, if it came to war, as Amaziah.
