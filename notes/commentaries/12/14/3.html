Both were zealous for Yahweh in the earlier portion of their reigns, but in the latter part fell away; both disregarded the rebukes of prophets; and both, having forsaken God, were in the end conspired against and slain (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-6. He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David his father&#8212;The beginning of his reign was excellent, for he acted the part of a constitutional king, according to the law of God, yet not with perfect sincerity of heart (compare 2Ch 25:2). As in the case of his father Joash, the early promise was belied by the devious course he personally followed in later life (see 2Ch 20:14), as well as by the public irregularities he tolerated in the kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Right in the sight of the Lord; </span> that which was in some sort agreeable to God’s will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not like David his father; </span> not sincerely, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-2.htm" title="And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.">2 Chronicles 25:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He did according to all things as Joash his father did, </span> i.e. for a time served God aright, but afterwards fell to idolatry, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm" title="Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.">2 Chronicles 25:14</a></span>, as Joash had done, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-3.htm" title="But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.">2 Kings 12:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord,.....

Of course this can only refer to the general resemblance not to the various parts of Amaziah’s conduct. The next verse, which is almost word for word the same as is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-3.htm" title="But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.">2 Kings 12:3</a> concerning Joash, shews how Amaziah walked in his father’s footsteps.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David his father.</span> Only one King of Judah hitherto, viz. Asa, had obtained the praise that he "did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, <span class="accented">as did David his father"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a>). All the others had fallen short more or less; and Amaziah fell short in many respects. He was wanting in "a perfect heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fixed intention to do God's will; he was proud and boastful (ver. 10); he gave way to idolatry in his later years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>), and he despised the reproof of the prophet who was sent to rebuke his sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-16.htm">2 Chronicles 25:16</a>). Though placed among the "good kings' by the authors of both Kings and Chronicles, it is, as it were, under protest, with a distinct intimation that, although better than most of his predecessors, he did not reach a high standard. <span class="cmt_word">He did according to all things as Joash his father did.</span> There is something of Oriental hyperbole in this statement, which must be understood in the spirit, not in the letter. The two kings were differently circumstanced, and history did not "repeat itself" in their reigns. The position of Joash with respect to Jehoiada finds no parallel in the circumstances of the life of Amaziah. Still, the lives are parallel to some extent. Both kings began better than they ended. Both were zealous for Jehovah at first, but turned to idolatry at last. Both opposed themselves to prophets, and treated their rebukes with scorn. Both reused conspiracy against them by their misconduct, and were murdered by the malcontents. Further, both were unsuccessful in war, had to withstand a siege of their capital, and bought off their enemy by the surrender of the greater part of its wealth, including the treasures of the temple (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophecy which Elisha uttered before his death is here followed immediately by the account of its fulfilment, and to this end the oppression of the Israelites by Hazael is mentioned once more, together with that turn of affairs which took place through the compassion of God after the death of Hazael and in the reign of his son Benhadad. &#1500;&#1495;&#1509; is a pluperfect: "Hazael had oppressed" (for the fact itself compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a>). For the sake of the covenant made with the patriarchs the Lord turned again to the Israelites, and would not destroy them, and did not cast them away from His face &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491; ("till now"), as was the case afterwards, but delivered them from the threatening destruction through the death of Hazael. For in the reign of his son and successor Benhadad, Joash the son of Jehoahaz took from him again (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is to be connected with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;) the cities which he (Hazael) had taken from Jehoahaz in the war. These cities which Hazael had wrested from Jehoahaz were on this side of the Jordan, for Hazael had conquered all Gilead in the time of Jehu (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>). Joash recovered the former from Benhadad, whilst his son Jeroboam reconquered Gilead also (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). </body></html>
