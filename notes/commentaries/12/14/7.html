At the north-western corner of this plain stands a mountain of rock-salt, and the tract between this mountain and the sea is a salt-marsh. Salt springs also abound in the plain itself, so that the name would be fully accounted for. It is doubted, however, whether the original of the word "valley," commonly used of clefts and ravines, can be applied to such a sunk plain as the Sabkah; and it is certainly most unlikely that 10,000 prisoners would have been conveyed upward of eighty miles (the distance of the Sabkah from Petra), through a rough and difficult country, only in order to be massacred. On the whole, it is perhaps most probable that the "Valley of Salt" yet remains to be discovered, and that its true position was near Selah or Petra (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a> note). Amaziah gave to Petra the name Joktheel, "subdued by God," in a religious spirit as an acknowledgment of the divine aid by which his victory was gained. The name failed to take permanent hold on the place, because the Edomites, on not long afterward recovering their city, restored the old appellation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>).<p>Unto this day - The writer of Kings evidently gives the exact words of his document, composed not later than the reign of Ahaz, before whose death the Edomites had recovered Petra. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 14:7.

He tells us that he gathered and marshalled his men of war, from twenty years old and upward, to the number of 300,000 choice men. To these he hired mercenary troops out of Israel, another 100,000. But a man of God forbade him to take the Israelites with him, as the Lord was not with Israel. Though grieved at the loss of the hundred talents, which he had paid for this body of allies, Amaziah separated them and sent them back again, wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great wrath. After this with his own troops only Amaziah undertook the war with Edom, in which he was successful. According to Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> IX. 9. 1) the first planned expedition was against the Amalekites and Gebalites as well as the Edomites. On Gebal, a city of Phœnicia, see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-18.htm" title="And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.">1 Kings 5:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the valley of salt</span>] The R.V. prints both ‘Valley’ and ‘Salt’ with capitals to mark it as a proper name. The LXX. has a transliteration of the two words <span class="greekheb">Γεμελέδ</span>. The Valley of Salt lay at the south of the Dead Sea, and was on the border of the Edomite territory. We read that the Edomites had revolted from Judah in the days of Joram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/8-20.htm" title="In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves....">2 Kings 8:20-22</a>), and it seems they had not as yet been reduced to subjection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ten thousand</span>] Beside the 10,000 slain in the battle, the Chronicler mentions 10,000 more who were taken captive, and cast headlong from the rock so ‘that they all were broken in pieces’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-12.htm" title="And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.">2 Chronicles 25:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and took Selah</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">Sela</span>] <span class="ital">by war</span>] Sela which signifies ‘a rock’ is probably the city which was known in later times as ‘Petra’. It was a city of Edom, not far from Mount Hor, about 2 days’ journey northward from the top of the gulf of Akabah. The Chronicler says nothing about Sela, but mentions ‘the rock’ as the place from which the 10,000 captives were cast down. It may have been from the height on which Sela stood and took its name, that the execution of the captives took place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">called the name of it Joktheel</span>] This name, which is a trisyllable (Jokthe-él) is interpreted by Gesenius as ‘a Deo subactum’. It might with propriety be given by Amaziah to a city won by him after the direction which God had given him to put away the Israelite mercenaries. He would consider that the victory was a direct gift from God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto this day</span>] That Sela continued to be called Jokteel at the time when the book of Kings was compiled is in the highest degree improbable. We know that Edom reconquered some of the lost territory very soon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm" title="For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>) and during the captivity made inroads into the south of Judah as far as Hebron (Joseph. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> xii. 8.6). But in this passage the compiler takes the words of an earlier writer, exactly as they stood, and that earlier record was made before Sela was recovered and before the name Joktheel had fallen into disuse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand.</span> Edom had revolted from Judah and recovered complete independence in the reign of Jehoram, about fifty years previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>). Since that time the two countries had remained at peace. Now, however, Amaziah resolved upon a great effort to resubjugate them. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:9. &sect; 1) and Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>), he levied an army of 400,000 men - 300,000 Jews, and 100,000 hired Israelites - with which he marched against the three nations of the Amalekites, the Idumaeans, and the Gabalites. Rebuked by a prophet for want of faith in calling to his aid the wicked Israelites, he consented to dismiss them, and made the invasion at the head of his own troops only. These were carefully organized (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>), and met with a great success. Ten thousand of his enemies fell in battle, and an equal number were made prisoners. These last were barbarously put to death by being precipitated from the top of a rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-12.htm">2 Chronicles 25:12</a>). "The valley of salt," the scene of the battle, is probably identified with the sunken plain, now called <span class="accented">Es Sabkah</span>, at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. This is "a large flat of at least six miles by ten, occasionally flooded" (Tristram), but dry in the summertime. It is full of salt springs, and is bounded on the west and northwest by a long ridge of pure salt, known as the <span class="accented">Khasm Usdum</span>, so that the name "valley of salt" would be very appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">And took Selah by war.</span> Selah with the article (<span class="accented">has-Selah</span>) can only be the Idumaean capital, which the Greeks called Petra (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), and which is one of the most remarkable sites in the world. In the rocky mountains which form the eastern boundary of the Arabah or sandy slope reaching from the edge of the Sabkah to the Red Sea, amid cliffs of gorgeous colors, pink and crimson and purple, and ravines as deep and narrow as that of Proffers, partly excavated in the rook, partly emplaced upon it, stood the Edomite town, difficult to approach, still more difficult to capture, more like the home of a colony of sea-gulls than that of a number of men. Petra is graphically described by Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 88-92), and has also received notice from Robinson ('Researches,' vol. it. pp. 518-538), Highten ('Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 3. p. 1191), and others. <span class="cmt_word">And called the name of it Joktheel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "subdued by God."
