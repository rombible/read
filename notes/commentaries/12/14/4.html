Both were zealous for Yahweh in the earlier portion of their reigns, but in the latter part fell away; both disregarded the rebukes of prophets; and both, having forsaken God, were in the end conspired against and slain (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-6. He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David his father&#8212;The beginning of his reign was excellent, for he acted the part of a constitutional king, according to the law of God, yet not with perfect sincerity of heart (compare 2Ch 25:2). As in the case of his father Joash, the early promise was belied by the devious course he personally followed in later life (see 2Ch 20:14), as well as by the public irregularities he tolerated in the kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Howbeit; </span> though he did right, &c., for this particle is to be joined with those words, the rest being to be closed with a parenthesis. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Howbeit the high places were not taken away,....

Even Asa did not remove them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>). They were remnants of an old ancestral worship which went back to the time of the judges, and which had been connived at by judges and kings and prophets. Local feeling was everywhere in their favor, since they provided for local needs, and enabled men to dispense with the long] and tedious journey to the distant Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places</span>; literally, <span class="accented">were sacrificing and burning incense</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> continued the practice, which had come down to them from their ancestors.

These cities which Hazael had wrested from Jehoahaz were on this side of the Jordan, for Hazael had conquered all Gilead in the time of Jehu (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>). Joash recovered the former from Benhadad, whilst his son Jeroboam reconquered Gilead also (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). </body></html>
