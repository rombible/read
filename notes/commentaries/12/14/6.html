But we must remember, first, that the custom was that of the East generally (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>); and secondly, that it had the sanction of one who might be thought to have known thoroughly the mind of the legislator, namely, Joshua (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The relative is not here in its most usual form for the sense of ‘as’, but it could hardly be explained as=wherein. Another example of this less common use is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-22.htm" title="As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister to me.">Jeremiah 33:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every man shall be put to death</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">shall die</span>] <span class="ital">for his own sin</span>] The <span class="ital">Kethib</span> gives a different form of the verb in the last clause and the R.V. has followed this.

A Greek poet went so far as to say that a man was a fool who put to death the father, and allowed the son to live. The practice had a double ground. Sons, it might be assumed, would be cognizant of their father's intention, and would so be accessories before the fact. And the law of <span class="accented">claim</span>, or "blood-feud," would make it dangerous to spare them, since they would be bound to avenge their father's death on his destroyer. That the practice prevailed among the Israelites appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a>, where we find the children of Achan involved in his fate, and again from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>, where we are told that Naboth's sons suffered with their father. But it was contrary to an express command of the Law, as the writer goes on to show. <span class="cmt_word">According unto that which is written in the book of the Law of Moses.</span> "The book of the Law of Moses" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) may be either the Pentateuch regarded as one book, or Deuteronomy, the particular" book" of the Pentateuch in which the passage occurs. In either case the passage is fatal to the theory of the late' composition of Deuteronomy, which is here found to have ruled the conduct of a Jewish king a hundred and fifty years before Manasseh, two hundred before Josiah, and two hundred and eighty before the return from the Captivity - the dates assigned to Deuteronomy by recent "advanced" critics. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> As usual, when one sacred writer quotes another, the quotation is not exact. "But" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) is inserted at the beginning of the final clause, and the form of the verb in the same clause is modified. It seems to be intended that we should be made to feel that it is the sentiment or meaning conveyed, and not the phraseology in which it is wrapped up, that is of importance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophecy which Elisha uttered before his death is here followed immediately by the account of its fulfilment, and to this end the oppression of the Israelites by Hazael is mentioned once more, together with that turn of affairs which took place through the compassion of God after the death of Hazael and in the reign of his son Benhadad. &#1500;&#1495;&#1509; is a pluperfect: "Hazael had oppressed" (for the fact itself compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a>).

For in the reign of his son and successor Benhadad, Joash the son of Jehoahaz took from him again (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; is to be connected with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;) the cities which he (Hazael) had taken from Jehoahaz in the war. These cities which Hazael had wrested from Jehoahaz were on this side of the Jordan, for Hazael had conquered all Gilead in the time of Jehu (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>). Joash recovered the former from Benhadad, whilst his son Jeroboam reconquered Gilead also (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). </body></html>
