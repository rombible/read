A time of trouble had, no doubt, supervened. The conspirators would not wish to see Amaziah placed upon the throne, and may have opposed and delayed his appointment. But their efforts proved fruitless. After a time, the young king was confirmed (literally, "strengthened"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> settled and established in his kingdom, all opposition being overcome or dying away. This seems to be what the writer means. He cannot intend a confirmation by a foreign suzerain, which the phrase used might import (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>), when he has given no hint of any subjection of the kingdom to any foreign power, or indeed of any serious attack on its independence. <span class="cmt_word">That he slew his servants.</span> Jozachar and Jehozabad were "servants" of Joash, apparently domestic servants employed in his palace, and are therefore reckoned "servants" also of his successor. <span class="cmt_word">Which had slain the king his father.</span> In the "house of Millo,' where he lay sick.

These cities which Hazael had wrested from Jehoahaz were on this side of the Jordan, for Hazael had conquered all Gilead in the time of Jehu (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>). Joash recovered the former from Benhadad, whilst his son Jeroboam reconquered Gilead also (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). </body></html>
