They had rid themselves of the idolatrous father, but there was hope in the sixteen year old son. In Chronicles the name of this king is spelt <span class="ital">Uzziah</span>. This variation also occurs in the next chapter of 2 Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-13.htm" title="Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.">2 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm" title="And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.">2 Kings 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-32.htm" title="In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.">2 Kings 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-34.htm" title="And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.">2 Kings 15:34</a>). With this may be compared <span class="ital">Azareel</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-18.htm" title="The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brothers, were twelve:">1 Chronicles 25:18</a>), which is found in verse 4 of the same chapter to be the person who is also called <span class="ital">Uzziel</span>. There is not much difference in the signification of the two forms.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - SUCCESSION OF AZARIAH AND RESUMPTION OF THE WAR WITH EDOM. Though reserving his account of the reign of Azariah to the next chapter (vers. 1-7), the writer is led by the circumstances of Amaziah's death to mention <span class="accented">at once</span> the fact of his son Azariah's succession, and the first important act of his reign, the resumption of war with Edom. He then breaks off suddenly, in order to interpose an account of the reign of Jeroboam II., who was contemporary with Amaziah during fourteen years of his reign, <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people of Judah took Azariah.</span> This is a new expression, and implies a new, perhaps a tumultuary, proceeding. The <span class="accented">people</span>, uncertain probably of the intentions of the conspirators, and fearful that they might set up a king not of the house of David, took the initiative, went to the royal palace, and finding there a son of Amaziah - whether his eldest son or not, we cannot say - proclaimed him king and placed him upon the throne. The author of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>) agrees. Josephus is silent. <span class="cmt_word">Which was sixteen years old.</span> Young certainly, considering that his father was fifty-four (see ver. 2), but not necessarily "a younger son," since Amaziah's earlier children may have been daughters, or he may have married late in life. It is not doubted that Manasseh was Hezekiah's eldest son, yet he was only twelve when Hezekiah died at the same age as Amaziah, viz. fifty-four. <span class="cmt_word">And made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</span> There are two forms of the king's name, Azariah and Uzziah. The difference between them is not so great in the Hebrew, where they both begin with the same letter; but still it is considerable. One name is not a mere contraction of the other. Some suppose that the king changed one name for the other upon his accession; others, that he was called indifferently by either, since they were very similar in meaning. "Azariah" is "he whose help is Jehovah;" "Uzziah," "he whose strength is Jehovah." "Uzziah" is the predominant form, occurring four times in 2 Kings, twelve times in 2 Chronicles, three times in Isaiah, once in Hoses, once in Amos, and once in Zechariah; while "Azariah" occurs only in 2 Kings (eight times) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a> (once). Josephus uses the form "Ozias" (equivalent to, Uzziah), and so does St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8, 9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The repetition of the notice concerning the end of the reign of Joash, together with the formula from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-12.htm">2 Kings 13:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-13.htm">2 Kings 13:13</a>, may probably be explained from the fact, that in the annals of the kings of Israel it stood after the account of the war between Jehoash and Amaziah. This may be inferred from the circumstance that the name of Joash is spelt invariably &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; here, whereas in the closing notices in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-12.htm">2 Kings 13:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-13.htm">2 Kings 13:13</a> we have the later form &#1497;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, the one which was no doubt adopted by the author of our books. But he might be induced to give these notices once more as he found them in his original sources, from the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-17.htm">2 Kings 14:17</a>, that Amaziah outlived Jehoash fifteen years, seeing therein a manifestation of the grace of God, who would not destroy Amaziah notwithstanding his pride, but delivered him, through the death of his victor, from further injuries at his hands. As Amaziah ascended the throne in the second year of the sixteen years' reign of Jehoash, and before his war with Israel made war upon the Edomites and overcame them, the war with Israel can only fall in the closing years of Jehoash, and this king cannot very long have survived his triumph over the king of Judah.</body></html>
