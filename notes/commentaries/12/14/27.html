It is a sign that God has not cast off his people, if he continues faithful ministers among them. Two reasons are given why God blessed them with those victories: 1. Because the distress was very great, which made them objects of his compassion. 2. Because the decree was not yet gone forth for their destruction. Many prophets there had been in Israel, but none left prophecies in writing till this age, and their prophecies are part of the Bible. Hosea began to prophesy in the reign of this Jeroboam. At the same time Amos prophesied; soon after Micah, then Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah. Thus God, in the darkest and most degenerate ages of the church, raised up some to be burning and shining lights in it; to their own age, by their preaching and living, and a few by their writings, to reflect light upon us in the last times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord said not - Though the Israelites were brought thus low, yet the fiat did not as yet go forth for their destruction.

Jeroboam, the son of Joash king of Israel&#8212;This was Jeroboam II who, on regaining the lost territory, raised the kingdom to great political power (2Ki 14:25), but adhered to the favorite religious policy of the Israelitish sovereigns (2Ki 14:24). While God granted him so great a measure of national prosperity and eminence, the reason is expressly stated (2Ki 14:26, 27) to be that the purposes of the divine covenant forbade as yet the overthrow of the kingdom of the ten tribes (see 2Ki 13:23).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord said not, </span> i.e. not yet; he had not yet declared this, as afterwards he did by the succeeding prophets, though not in those words.

On the contrary, he gave the nation a breathing-space, a gleam of light, a second summer before the winter set in - a further opportunity of repenting and turning to him with all their hearts if they would only have taken advantage of it, a chance of redeeming the past and reestablishing themselves in his favor. He might well have destroyed them at this time if he had looked only to considerations of justice, if in his wrath he had not thought upon mercy. <span class="cmt_word">But he saved them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gave them the deliverance promised first by Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>), and then by Jonah the son of Amittai (ver. 25) - deliverance from Syria, recovery of their borders, and triumph over their enemies. He gave them all this <span class="cmt_word">by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.</span> Joash began the salvation, but it was reserved for Jeroboam to complete it. He was the true "savior" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>), the true accomplisher of the work, for which his father only paved the way. Thus one Jeroboam founded the kingdom; another refounded it, restored its ancient glories, and gave it its old dimensions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the people of Judah, i.e., the whole nation, not the whole of the men of war (Thenius), thereupon made his son Azariah (Uzziah) king, who was only sixteen years old. &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; or &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is the name given to this king here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-1.htm">2 Kings 15:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-6.htm">2 Kings 15:6</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-17.htm">2 Kings 15:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-23.htm">2 Kings 15:23</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a>; whereas in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-3.htm">2 Chronicles 26:3</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-11.htm">2 Chronicles 26:11</a>, etc., and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-1.htm">Hosea 1:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>, he is called &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; or &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (Uzziah). This variation in the name is too constant to be attributable to a copyist's error. Even the conjecture that Azariah adopted the name Uzziah as king, or that it was given to him by the soldiers after a successful campaign (Thenius), does not explain the use of the two names in our historical books. We must rather assume that the two names, which are related in meaning, were used promiscuously. &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; signifies "in Jehovah is help;" &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;, "whose strength is Jehovah." This is favoured by the circumstance adduced by Bertheau, that among the descendants of Kohath we also find an Uzziah who bears the name Azariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-9.htm">1 Chronicles 6:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-21.htm">1 Chronicles 6:21</a>), and similarly among the descendants of Heman an Uzziel with the name Azarel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-18.htm">1 Chronicles 25:18</a>).</body></html>
