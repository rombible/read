The hands of the idol Moloch being red hot, the children were passed through between them, which was considered a form of lustration. There is reason to believe that, in certain circumstances, the children were burnt to death (Ps 106:37). This was strongly prohibited in the law (Le 18:21; 20:2-5; De 18:10), although there is no evidence that it was practised in Israel till the time of Ahaz.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> After the manner of the heathens: <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm" title="You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:">Deu 12:2</a>"</span>; <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm" title="For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress; when on every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.">Jeremiah 2:20</a>"</span>; <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-13.htm" title="They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit prostitution, and your spouses shall commit adultery.">Hosea 4:13</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills,....

It was probably the stimulus that his example gave to the cult which induced Hezekiah to abolish it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And on the hills, and under every green tree</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>, with the comment). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jotham of Judah (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-1.htm">2 Chronicles 27:1-9</a>). - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32</a>. "In the second year of Pekah Jotham began to reign." This agrees with the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27</a>, that Pekah became king in the last year of Uzziah, supposing that it occurred at the commencement of the year. Jotham's sixteen years therefore came to a close in the seventeenth year of Pekah's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-1.htm">2 Kings 16:1</a>). His reign was like that of his father Uzziah (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-3.htm">2 Kings 15:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>), except, as is added in Chr. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>, that he did not force himself into the temple of the Lord, as Uzziah had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). All that is mentioned of his enterprises in the account before us is that he built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, that is to say, that he restored it, or perhaps added to its beauty. The upper gate, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a> compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-3.htm">2 Kings 8:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-5.htm">2 Kings 8:5</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16</a>, is the gate at the north side of the inner or upper court, where all the sacrifices were slaughtered, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38-43</a>. We also find from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>. that he built against the wall of Ophel, and several cities in the mountains of Judah, and castles and towers in the forests, and subdued the Ammonites, so that they paid him tribute for three years. Jotham carried on with great vigour, therefore, the work which his father had began, to increase the material prosperity of his subjects. </body></html>
