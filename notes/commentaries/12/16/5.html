The <span class= "ital">time</span> is soon after the accession of Ahaz. “Jotham, the last of a series of strong and generally successful princes, had died at a critical moment, when Pekah and Rezin were maturing their plans against his kingdom. The opposing parties in northern Israel suspended their feuds to make common cause against Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-21.htm" title="Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:21</a>), and the proud inhabitants of Samaria hoped by this policy to more than restore the prestige forfeited in previous years of calamity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/9-9.htm" title="And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,">Isaiah 9:9-10</a>). At the same time the Syrians began to operate in the eastern dependencies of Judah, their aim being to possess themselves of the harbour of Elath on the Red Sea, while the Philistines attacked the Judeans in the rear, and ravaged the fertile lowlands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-12.htm" title="The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm" title="At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelled there to this day.">2Kings 16:6</a>). A heavy and sudden disaster had already fallen on the Judean arms, a defeat in which ‘head and tail, palm-branch and rush’ had been mown down in indiscriminate slaughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-14.htm" title="Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.">Isaiah 9:14</a>). Ahaz was no fit leader in so critical a time; his character was petulant and childish, his policy was dictated in the harem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm" title="As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths.">Isaiah 3:12</a>). Nor was the internal order of the state calculated to inspire confidence. Wealth, indeed, had greatly accumulated in the preceding time of prosperity, but its distribution had been such that it weakened rather than added strength to the nation. The rich nobles were steeped in sensual luxury, the court was full of gallantry, feminine extravagance and vanity gave the tone to aristocratic society (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm" title="Woe to them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!">Isaiah 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:">Isaiah 3:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm" title="As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.

And from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-2.htm" title="And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.">Isaiah 7:2</a> we can see into what agitation the people of Judah were brought by the advance of the allied enemies. ‘It was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim (i.e. Israel). And his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome</span> him] i.e. They never took Jerusalem (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.">Isaiah 7:1</a>). This is the security which Isaiah was instructed to promise to Ahaz. But it is evident from the narrative of the Chronicler that much damage was done in the land by the invasion. He says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="Why the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.">2 Chronicles 28:5</a>) that Ahaz was delivered into the hand of the king of Syria, who smote him and carried away a great multitude of captives and brought them to Damascus, and he was also delivered into the hand of Pekah king of Israel, who slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand men in one day, and carried away captive two hundred thousand, women, sons and daughters, along with much spoil. We can understand the stir caused in Jerusalem by the approach of an army which had already inflicted such blows upon the land.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> <span class="accented">- War of Ahazleith Pekah and Rezin</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Rezin King of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah King of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war.</span> The alliance between Rezin and Pekah has been already glanced at (2 Kings 16:37). It began, apparently, in the reign of Jotham. The policy which brought it about was one that was entirely new. Since Syria developed an aggressive tendency under the first Ben-hadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), there had till now been no alliance made with her by either of the two Israelite kingdoms. She had been reckoned as their common enemy; and while they had on two occasions been allied together against her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28</a>), never as yet had either asked her help against the other. Now, however, Ephraim became confederate with Syria against Judah. The new policy must be ascribed to the new condition of things consequent upon the attitude assumed by Assyria under Tiglath-pileser. Assyria had been under a cloud for forty years. The nations of the western coast of Asia had ceased to fear her, and had felt at liberty to pursue their own quarrels. Her recovery of vigor altered the whole situation. It was at once evident to the statesmen who directed the policy of the small western states that, unless they combined; they were lost. Hence the alliance between Pekah and Rezin. Probably they would have been glad to have drawn Ahaz into the confederacy; but it would seem that he did not share their fears, and would not join them. Hereupon the design was formed to dethrone him, and set up in his place a new ruler, a certain Ben-Tabeal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>), on whose assistance they could rely. The two confederate princes then began the campaign. Pekah invaded Judaea, and gained a great victory over Ahaz, which is perhaps exaggerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-15</a>; Rezin carried his arms further south, took Elath, and reestablished the Edomites in power (see the comment on ver. 6). Then the allies joined forces and proceeded to besiege Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And they besieged Ahaz,</span> but could not ever-come him. The siege is mentioned by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>, who was commissioned by God to comfort Ahaz, and assure him that the city would not fall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-7.htm">Isaiah 7:7</a>). The fortifications of Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>) and Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) had, no doubt, greatly strengthened the city since the time when (as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>) it was captured so easily by Joash. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In those days the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin, etc. It is evident from the position of this verse at the close of the account of Jotham, that the incursions of the allied Syrians and Israelites into Judah under the command of Rezin and Pekah commenced in the closing years of Jotham, so that these foes appeared before Jerusalem at the very beginning of the reign of Ahaz. - It is true that the Syrians had been subjugated by Jeroboam II((<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>); but in the anarchical condition of the Israelitish kingdom after his death, they had no doubt recovered their independence. They must also have been overcome by the Assyrians under Pul, for he could never have marched against Israel without having first of all conquered Syria. But as the power of the Assyrians was greatly weakened for a time by the falling away of the Medes and Babylonians, the Syrians had taken advantage of this weakness to refuse the payment of tribute to Assyria, and had formed an alliance with Pekah of Israel to conquer Judah, and thereby to strengthen their power so as to be able to offer a successful resistance to any attack from the side of the Euphrates. - But as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a> show, it was otherwise decreed in the counsels of the Lord. </body></html>
