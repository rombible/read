Mr. Locke says, It was something made for the purpose of covering the people from the injuries of the weather on the sabbath days, when more were wont to assemble at the temple than the porch could contain: and Houbigant supposes it was something of the same kind. It is, indeed, generally understood to have been some building, either where the priests, after their weekly course was ended, abode until the next course came, which they did upon the sabbath day; or in which the guard of the temple kept their station; or some canopy, or other covered place, under which the king used to sit to hear God’s word, and see the sacrifices, which might be called <span class="ital">the covert of the sabbath, </span>because the chief times in which the king used it for those ends was the weekly sabbath, and other solemn days of feasting or fasting, (which all come under the name of <span class="ital">sabbaths, </span>in the Old Testament,) upon which the king used more solemnly to present himself before the Lord than at other times. “And the reason,” says Dr. Dodd, “why the king ordered this to be taken away was, because he intended to trouble himself no more with coming to the temple, and by this action to express his hatred and contempt of the sabbath, as his removing the bases, the laver, and the brazen sea, was probably with a design to deface the service of God in the temple, and thence to bring it into public disesteem.” <span class="ital">The king’s entry without — </span>The passage by which he used to go from his palace to the temple, and which had been made for the convenience of the royal family; <span class="ital">turned he </span>— Another way, and for other uses, <span class="ital">from the house of the Lord — </span>To show that he did not intend to frequent the house of the Lord any longer. <span class="ital">For the king of Assyria — </span>To oblige him, who probably had returned his visit, and found fault with this entry, as inconvenient, and a disparagement to his palace. Thus, to ingratiate himself with this heathen king, he expresses his public contempt and rejection of that religion which had been the only partition wall between the kings of Judah and other kings.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:17-20 Ahaz put contempt upon the sabbath, and thus opened a wide inlet to all manner of sin.

Used on the sabbath day, either for the people to sit under to hear the law explained by the priests; or for the course of the priests to be in, that went out that day, to give way to the course that entered, which yet did not depart from the temple till evening; or rather for the king himself to sit under, while attending the temple service of that day, and might be the cover of the scaffold, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a> and be very rich cloth of gold; and therefore he took it away for the king of Assyria, or to signify that he should not frequent the place any more: and hence it follows: <p>and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the Lord; the way which led from the king's palace to it, he turned it a round about way, that it might not be discerned there was a way from the one to the other: and this he did <p>for the king of Assyria; to gratify him, that he might from hence conclude that he had wholly relinquished the worship of God in the temple, and should cleave to the gods of Damascus and Syria; or for fear of him, that he might not see the way into the temple, and take away the vessels; or find him, should he be obliged to hide himself there, when in danger by him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> for the king of Assyria.</span><p>(l) Or tent, in which they lay on the sabbath, who had served their week in the temple and so departed home.<p>(m) Either to flatter the king of Assyria, when he should thus see him change the ordinance of God or else that the temple might be a refuge for him if the king should suddenly assault his house.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">And the covert</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">the covered way</span>] <span class="ital">for the sabbath</span>] The noun, which occurs nowhere else, signifies some colonnade along which the king could pass when on the sabbath he went to the temple. It is not mentioned in the description of the temple building, and must have been added afterwards, and most likely was richly adorned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that they had built in the house</span>] i.e. in the temple court, not in the interior of the temple-building.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the king’s entry without</span>] This is perhaps the ‘ascent’ mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-4.htm" title="And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.">2 Chronicles 9:4</a> and which called forth the great admiration of the queen of Sheba. We may be sure it was made as beautiful as Solomon’s workmen and wealth could make it. This was outside the temple precincts but perhaps was closely joined to the covered way before mentioned so that the whole of the king’s progress might be made in private.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">turned he</span> from [R.V. <span class="bld">unto</span>] <span class="ital">the house of the Lord</span>] There is considerable difficulty in this clause. One thing however is clear, that ‘from’ cannot be correct. The accusative is the case of direction, and there is no preposition expressed in the original. Hence ‘unto’ must be the sense. The A.V. seems to have intended to describe the removal or alteration of these two passages so as to separate them from the temple, the R.V., which gives in the margin ‘round’, appears to imply that both the erections, the one from the palace to the temple area, the other within the court, were brought into closer proximity to the temple-building. But the verb rendered ‘turned’ signifies ‘changed’ also, and it seems not unlikely that it refers to an alteration made in these colonnades similar to that which had been made with the bases and the brasen sea. From them all the decorative portion had been taken away lest it should excite the cupidity of the Assyrian. And in the richly decorated ascent and covered way a like dismantling took place and for a like reason. If this be the sense, then ‘unto the house of the Lord’ must be taken as an adverbial clause explaining that the removal of ornaments and gold took place throughout the whole length, even up to the very temple building.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">because of</span>] <span class="ital">the king of Assyria</span>] The preposition=literally ‘from the face of’ is a form constantly employed after verbs of fleeing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-8.htm" title="And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, from where came you? and where will you go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.">Genesis 16:8</a>), of seeking help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-20.htm" title="And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry to the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a savior, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.">Isaiah 19:20</a>) and so of fearing, humbling oneself, trembling, &c. This is its sense here. Ahaz did what he did, because he was fearful that otherwise the Assyrian king would seize on all that was choicest. The tribute already claimed had doubtless been large, and the subject monarch though glad of his deliverance from Rezin and Pekah, felt that the drain on his resources ought to be allowed to extend no farther, if he could prevent it. We need not suppose that Tiglath-pileser was about to come in person to visit Jerusalem. His emissaries were sure to be there, and the report of existing treasure was sure to give rise to enlarged demands.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house.</span> The "covert for the sabbath" was probably (as Keil notes) "a covered place or stand in the court of the temple, to be used by the king whenever he visited the temple with his retinue on the sabbath, or on feast-days." It may have been elaborately ornamented. <span class="cmt_word">And the king's entry without.</span> This may have been "the ascent into the house of the Lord," which Solomon constructed for his own use (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>), and which was among those marvels of art that made the spirit of the Queen of Sheba faint within her. <span class="cmt_word">Turned he from the house of the Lord for the King of Assyria.</span> It is not clear what meaning our translators intended to express, and it is still less clear what was the sense intended by the original writer. Ahaz did something to the royal stand inside the temple, and to the;' ascent" which led to it, and what he did was done, not "for the King of Assyria," but "<span class="accented">for fear</span> of the King of Assyria;" but what exactly his action was, we cannot say.

The form &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; is neither to be altered into &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; nor regarded as a copyist's error for &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, as we have several words in this chapter that are formed with dull Syriac u-sound. The visit of Ahaz to Damascus is simply mentioned on account of what follows, namely, that Ahaz saw an altar there, which pleased him so much that he sent a picture and model of it "according to all the workmanship thereof," i.e., its style of architecture, to Urijah the priest (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>), and had an altar made like it for the temple, upon which, on his return to Jerusalem, he ordered all the burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and drink-offerings to be presented. The allusion here is to the offerings which he commanded to be presented for his prosperous return to Jerusalem. </body></html>
