The ambassadors had no difficulty in attaining their object, which perfectly fell in with the schemes of the great king. The invincible army was set in motion, Damascus was taken, and its inhabitants led captive, and Gilead and Galilee suffered the same fate” (<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>.) According to Schrader, the expedition “to Philistia”in 734 B.C., was directed against Pekah, who probably saved himself by an instant submission. It was only after Tiglath had settled matters with the northern kingdom, and so isolated Damascus, that he turned his arms against Rezin. Two whole years were spent in reducing him (733-732 B.C. ) In an inscription dating from his seventeenth year, Tiglath Pileser mentions that he received tribute from Eniel, king of Hamath, Muthumbaal, king of Arvad, Sanibu of Ammon, Salamanu of Moab, Mitinti of Asca-lon, Jahuhazi (Jehoahaz, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Ahaz) of Judah, Qausmalaka of Edom, Hanun of Gaza, and other princes. This probably relates to the expedition of 734 B.C. , in which year, therefore, Ahaz (Jehoahaz) must have put himself under the protection of Assyria (Schrader, <span class= "ital">K.A.T.,</span> p. 257 <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-8.htm" title="And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.">2 Kings 16:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Ahaz took the silver, </span>&c. — The treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king’s house, had been sent some years before by Jehoash to the king of Syria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.">2 Kings 12:18</a>. It seems, however, they had been well replenished again by the piety of his successors, Amaziah, Azariah, and especially Jotham. But what authority had Ahaz to dispose thus of the public money, and exhaust the treasures of both church and state, to gratify his new patron and guardian? We can only answer, that it is common for those, who have brought themselves into straits by one sin, to endeavour to extricate themselves by another. And those that have alienated themselves from God, will make no difficulty in alienating from him any other of his rights. In this instance, the sin itself was its own punishment; for, though the king of Assyria <span class="ital">hearkened unto Ahaz, </span>and, for his own ends, made a descent on Damascus, and took it, thereby giving a powerful diversion to the king of Syria, and obliging him to forego his design against Jerusalem; yet Ahaz made but an ill bargain, seeing he not only robbed the temple, and expended his own treasures, but enslaved both himself and his people to the king of Assyria.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 Few and evil were the days of Ahaz.

So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser&#8212;In spite of the assurance given him by Isaiah by two signs, the one immediate, the other remote (Isa 7:14; 8:4), that the confederate kings would not prevail against him, Ahaz sought aid from the Assyrian monarch, to purchase which he sent the treasures of the palace and temple.

The Chronicler says he ‘gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God’. This looks as if he melted down the gold and silver to send to Tiglath-pileser.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>for <span class="ital">a present</span>] The word is not that term for present which literally signifies ‘blessing’ (see note on v. 15). This word has rather the sense of a ‘bribe’. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm" title="And you shall take no gift: for the gift blinds the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.">Exodus 23:8</a> it is ‘the <span class="ital">gift</span> that blindeth the wise’. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-25.htm" title="Cursed be he that takes reward to slay an innocent person.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-3.htm" title="And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.">1 Samuel 8:3</a> it is a ‘<span class="ital">bribe</span>’.

So that the <span class="ital">present</span> of Ahaz is not represented by this word as of a noble character.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.</span> Hitherto the temple treasures had been diverted from their proper use, and secularized for the sole purpose (except in one instance) of buying off the hostility of foreign foe, who threatened the city and the temple itself with destruction (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>). Now, as on <span class="accented">one</span> former occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), they were utilized to purchase an alliance. <span class="cmt_word">And sent it for a present to the King of Assyria.</span> So Gyges King of Syria sent presents to Asshur-bani-pal to purchase his aid against the Cimmerians ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 68), and Susub of Babylon sent his temple treasures to Umman-Minan of Elam (ibid., pp. 46, 47), to purchase his assistance against Sennacherib. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the time mentioned, "in the seventeenth year of Pekah Ahaz became king" see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32</a>. The datum "twenty years old" is a striking one, even if we compare with it <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>. As Ahaz reigned only sixteen years, and at his death his son Hezekiah became king at the age of twenty-five years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>), Ahaz must have begotten him in the eleventh year of his age. It is true that in southern lands this is neither impossible nor unknown,<p>(Note: In the East they marry girls of nine or ten years of age to boys of twelve or thirteen (Volney, Reise, ii. p. 360). Among the Indians husbands of ten years of age and wives of eight are mentioned (Thevenot, Reisen, iii. pp. 100 and 165). In Abyssinia boys of twelve and even ten years old marry (Rppell, Abessynien, ii. p. 59). Among the Jews in Tiberias, mothers of eleven years of age and fathers of thirteen are not uncommon (Burckh. Syrien, p. 570); and Lynch saw a wife there, who to all appearance was a mere child about ten years of age, who had been married two years already. In the epist. ad N. Carbonelli, from Hieronymi epist. ad Vitalem, 132, and in an ancient glossa, Bochart has also cited examples of one boy of ten years and another of nine, qui nutricem suam gravidavit, together with several other cases of a similar kind from later writers. Cf. Bocharti Opp. i.((Geogr. sacr.) p. 920, ed. Lugd. 1692.)<p>but in the case of the kings of Judah it would be without analogy. The reading found in the lxx, Syr., and Arab. at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-1.htm">2 Chronicles 28:1</a>, and also in certain codd., viz., five and twenty instead of twenty, may therefore be a preferable one. According to this, Hezekiah, like Ahaz, was born in his father's sixteenth year.</body></html>
