So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.">1Kings 12:32-33</a>.) It thus appears that Ahaz, like Uzziah, personally exercised the priestly function of sacrifice.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:10-16 God's altar had hitherto been kept in its place, and in use; but Ahaz put another in the room of it. The natural regard of the mind of man to some sort of religion, is not easily extinguished; but except it be regulated by the word, and by the Spirit of God, it produces absurd superstitions, or detestable idolatries. Or, at best, it quiets the sinner's conscience with unmeaning ceremonies.

They were comparatively small, and scarcely suited for "whole burnt-offerings." One type was square, about half the height of a man, and ornamented round the top with a sort of battlement. Another had a triangular base and a circular top consisting of a single flat stone. A third was a sort of portable stand, narrow, and about the height of a man. This last was of the kind which the kings took with them in their expeditions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-16. And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser&#8212;This was a visit of respect, and perhaps of gratitude. During his stay in that heathen city, Ahaz saw an altar with which he was greatly captivated. Forthwith a sketch of it was transmitted to Jerusalem, with orders to Urijah the priest to get one constructed according to the Damascus model, and let this new altar supersede the old one in the temple. Urijah, with culpable complaisance, acted according to his instructions (2Ki 16:16). The sin in this affair consisted in meddling with, and improving according to human taste and fancy, the altars of the temple, the patterns of which had been furnished by divine authority (Ex 25:40; 26:30; 27:1; 1Ch 28:19). Urijah was one of the witnesses taken by Isaiah to bear his prediction against Syria and Israel (Isa 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, a sacrifice, and that not unto God, but unto the Syrian idols, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-23.htm" title="For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me.

What the writer has it in his mind to record is that the king, on his return from Damascus, at once made use of the new' altar for his private sacrifices. If he had meant to tax Ahaz with so great a sin as that which brought the curse of leprosy upon Uzziah, he would almost certainly have made his meaning clearer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of the war which the allied Syrians and Israelites waged upon Ahaz, only the principal fact is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a>, namely, that the enemy marched to Jerusalem to war, but were not able to make war upon the city, i.e., to conquer it; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a> we have a brief notice of the capture of the port of Elath by the Syrians. We find <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a> again, with very trifling alterations, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a> at the head of the prophecy, in which the prophet promises the king the help of God and predicts that the plans of his enemies will fail. According to this, the allied kings intended to take Judah, to dethrone Ahaz, and to install a vassal king, viz., the son of Tabeel. We learn still more concerning this war, which had already begun, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>, in the closing years of Jotham, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5-15</a>; namely, that the two kings inflicted great defeats upon Ahaz, and carried off many prisoners and a large amount of booty, but that the Israelites set their prisoners at liberty again, by the direction of the prophet Oded, and after feeding and clothing them, sent them back to their brethren. It is now generally admitted that these statements are not at variance with our account (as Ges., Winer, and others maintain), but can be easily reconciled with it, and simply serve to complete it.<p>(Note: Compare C. P. Caspari's article on the Syro-Ephraimitish war in the reigns of Jotham and Ahaz (Univers. Progr. von Christiania, 1849), where the different views concerning the relation between the two accounts are fully discussed, and the objections to the credibility of the account given in the Chronicles most conclusively answered.)<p>The only questions in dispute are, whether the two accounts refer to two different campaigns, or merely to two different events in the same campaign, and whether the battles to which the Chronicles allude are to be placed before or after the siege of Jerusalem mentioned in our text. The first question cannot be absolutely decided, since there are no decisive arguments to be found in favour of either the one supposition or the other; and even "the one strong argument" which Caspari finds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a> against the idea of two campaigns is not conclusive. For if the design which the prophet there attributes to the allied kings, "we will make a breach in Judah," i.e., storm his fortresses and his passes and conquer them, does obviously presuppose, that at the time when the enemy spake or thought in this manner, Judah was still standing uninjured and unconquered, and therefore the battles mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5-6</a> cannot yet have been fought; it by no means follows from the connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a> (of the same chapter) that <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a> refers to plans which the enemy had only just formed at the time when Isaiah spoke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-4.htm">2 Kings 7:4</a>.). On the contrary, Isaiah is simply describing the plans which the enemy devised and pursued, and which they had no doubt formed from the very commencement of the war, and now that they were marching against Jerusalem, hoped to attain by the conquest of the capital. All that we can assume as certain is, that the war lasted longer than a year, since the invasion of Judah by these foes had already commenced before the death of Jotham, and that the greater battles (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5-6</a>) were not fought till the time of Ahaz, and it was not till his reign that the enemy advanced to the siege of Jerusalem. - With regard to the second question, it cannot be at all doubtful that the battles mentioned preceded the advance of the enemy to the front of Jerusalem, and therefore our account merely mentions the last and principal event of the war, and that the enemy was compelled to retreat from Jerusalem by the fact that the king of Assyria, Tiglath-pileser, whom Ahaz had called to his help, marched against Syria and compelled Rezin to hurry back to the defence of his kingdom. - It is more difficult to arrange in the account of the capture of Elath by the Syrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>) among the events of this war. The expression &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; merely assigns it in a perfectly general manner to the period of the war. The supposition of Thenius, that it did not take place till after the siege of Jerusalem had been relinquished, and that Rezin, after the failure of his attempt to take Jerusalem, that he might not have come altogether in vain, marched away from Jerusalem round the southern point of the Dead Sea and conquered Elath, is impossible, because he would never have left his own kingdom in such a defenceless state to the advancing Assyrians. We must therefore place the taking of Elath by Rezin before his march against Jerusalem, though we still leave it undecided how Rezin conducted the war against Ahaz: whether by advancing along the country to the east of the Jordan, defeating the Judaeans there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5</a>), and then pressing forward to Elath and conquering that city, while Pekah made a simultaneous incursion into Judah from the north and smote Ahaz, so that it was not till after the conquest of Elath that Rezin entered the land from the south, and there joined Pekah for a common attack upon Jerusalem, as Caspari supposes; or whether by advancing into Judah along with Pekah at the very outset, and after he had defeated the army of Ahaz in a great battle, sending a detachment of his own army to Idumaea, to wrest that land from Judah and conquer Elath, while he marched with the rest of his forces in combination with Pekah against Jerusalem.<p>"Rezin brought Elath to Aram and drove the Jews out of Elath, and Aramaeans came to Elath and dwelt therein to this day." &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; does not mean "to lead back" here, but literally to turn, to bring to a person; for Elath had never belonged to Aram before this, but was an Edomitish city, so that even if we were to read &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1512;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; could not mean to bring back. But there is no ground whatever for altering &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; into &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; (Cler., Mich., Ew., Then., and others), whereas the form &#1488;&#1512;&#1501; is at variance with such an alteration through the assumption of an exchange of r and d, because &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; is never written defective &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a>. There are also no sufficient reasons for altering &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (Keri); &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; is merely a Syriac form for &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; with the dull Syriac u-sound, several examples of which form occur in this very chapter, - e.g., &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; for &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a>, and &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1514; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>, - whereas &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;, with additions, is only written plene twice in the ancient books, and that in the Chronicles, where the scriptio plena is generally preferred (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>), but is always written defective (&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;). Moreover the statement that "&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (Edomites, not the Edomites) came thither," etc., would be very inappropriate, since Edomites certainly lived in this Idumaean city in perfect security, even while it was under Judaean government. And there would be no sense in the expression "the Edomites dwelt there to this day," since the Edomites remained in their own land to the time of the captivity. All this is applicable to Aramaeans alone. As soon as Rezin had conquered this important seaport town, it was a very natural thing to establish an Aramaean colony there, which obtained possession of the trade of the town, and remained there till the time when the annals of the kings were composed (for it is to this that the expression &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; refers), even after the kingdom of Rezin had long been destroyed by the Assyrians, since Elath and the Aramaeans settled there were not affected by that blow.<p>(Note: If we only observe that &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; has not the article, and therefore the words merely indicate the march of an Aramaean colony to Elath, it is evident that &#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; would be unsuitable; for when the &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; had been driven from the city which the Syrians had conquered, it was certainly not some Edomites but the Edomites who took possession again. Hence Winer, Caspari, and others are quite right in deciding that &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is the only correct reading.)<p>As soon as the Edomites had been released by Rezin from the control of Judah, to which they had been brought back by Amaziah and Uzziah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>), they began plundering Judah again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>); and even the Philistines took possession of several cities in the lowland, to avenge themselves for the humiliation they had sustained at the hand of Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). </body></html>
