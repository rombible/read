Ahaz spoiled the Temple of its ornamental work, not out of wanton malice, but from dire necessity. He had to provide a present <span class= "ital">for the king of Assyria.</span> Thus these verses are really a continuation of the first statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10</a>. They inform us how Ahaz managed not to appear empty-handed at Damascus. (So Thenius.) Prof. R. Smith says: “Ahaz, whose treasures had been exhausted by his first tribute, was soon driven by the repeated demands of his masters to strip the Temple even of its ancient bronze-work and other fixed ornaments. The incidental mention of this fact in a fragment of the history of the Temple incorporated in the Book of Kings is sufficient evidence of the straits to which the kingdom of Judah was reduced.”<p><span class= "bld">Borders of the bases.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-28.htm" title="And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:">1Kings 7:28</a>. Thenius thinks Ahaz replaced them with unadorned plates, and set the laver up in a different fashion; but the text does not <span class= "ital">say</span> so.

There were ten bases, with a laver on the top of each one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen</span>] This sea was also the work of Hiram. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/7-23.htm" title="And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about....">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>. It was supported by twelve oxen, three looking each way, and standing with their tails beneath the huge vessel. Ahaz took these beautiful castings away and allowed the sea to rest upon stone supports. As all these acts are in the next verse said to be done ‘because of the king of Assyria’ we may suppose that Tiglath-pileser was disposed to ask for the beautiful things which he saw, and as it was not in Ahaz’s power to say him nay, the king removed these treasures that the Assyrian monarch might not see and ask for them.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases.</span> By "the bases" are probably meant the stands of the ten brazen layers, which Hiram the Tyrian artificer made for Solomon, and which Solomon placed outside the temple, five on either side of the entrance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-39.htm">1 Kings 7:39</a>). The "borders of the bases" seem to have consisted of ornamental panels, on which were carved, in relief, figures of lions, oxen, and cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-29.htm">1 Kings 7:29</a>), The object of Ahaz in these mutilations may have been merely destructive, as we find Egyptian kings, after a change of religion, mutilating the tablets, and erasing the inscriptions put up in honor of those gods who had ceased to be in favor with them. Or, possibly, he may, as Keil supposes, have wished to transfer the ornamental carvings to some other edifice, e.g. an idolatrous temple or a palace. <span class="cmt_word">And removed the laver from off them</span> - removed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from each base "the laver" which stood upon it - <span class="cmt_word">and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it.</span> (On Solomon's "molten sea," or great laver, and the twelve oxen which supported it, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>.) The "sea" was probably removed from off the backs of the oxen, in order that they might be made use of, as ornaments, elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">And put it upon a pavement of stones</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon a pedestal of stone</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ahaz paid Tiglath-pileser a visit in Damascus, "to present to him his thanks and congratulations, and possibly also to prevent a visit from Tiglath-pileser to himself, which would not have been very welcome" (Thenius). The form &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; is neither to be altered into &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; nor regarded as a copyist's error for &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, as we have several words in this chapter that are formed with dull Syriac u-sound. The visit of Ahaz to Damascus is simply mentioned on account of what follows, namely, that Ahaz saw an altar there, which pleased him so much that he sent a picture and model of it "according to all the workmanship thereof," i.e., its style of architecture, to Urijah the priest (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>), and had an altar made like it for the temple, upon which, on his return to Jerusalem, he ordered all the burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and drink-offerings to be presented. The allusion here is to the offerings which he commanded to be presented for his prosperous return to Jerusalem. </body></html>
