The natural regard of the mind of man to some sort of religion, is not easily extinguished; but except it be regulated by the word, and by the Spirit of God, it produces absurd superstitions, or detestable idolatries. Or, at best, it quiets the sinner's conscience with unmeaning ceremonies.

And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser&#8212;This was a visit of respect, and perhaps of gratitude. During his stay in that heathen city, Ahaz saw an altar with which he was greatly captivated. Forthwith a sketch of it was transmitted to Jerusalem, with orders to Urijah the priest to get one constructed according to the Damascus model, and let this new altar supersede the old one in the temple. Urijah, with culpable complaisance, acted according to his instructions (2Ki 16:16). The sin in this affair consisted in meddling with, and improving according to human taste and fancy, the altars of the temple, the patterns of which had been furnished by divine authority (Ex 25:40; 26:30; 27:1; 1Ch 28:19). Urijah was one of the witnesses taken by Isaiah to bear his prediction against Syria and Israel (Isa 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having once began to debauch his conscience, he could not now make an honourable retreat; and therefore proceeds to execute all the king’s commands. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that King Ahaz commanded.

The form &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; is neither to be altered into &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; nor regarded as a copyist's error for &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, as we have several words in this chapter that are formed with dull Syriac u-sound. The visit of Ahaz to Damascus is simply mentioned on account of what follows, namely, that Ahaz saw an altar there, which pleased him so much that he sent a picture and model of it "according to all the workmanship thereof," i.e., its style of architecture, to Urijah the priest (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>), and had an altar made like it for the temple, upon which, on his return to Jerusalem, he ordered all the burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and drink-offerings to be presented. The allusion here is to the offerings which he commanded to be presented for his prosperous return to Jerusalem. </body></html>
