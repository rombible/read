The verse seems to imply that Urijah had pushed it forward nearer to the sanctuary, and set the new Syrian altar in its place. Ahaz, not satisfied with this arrangement, which appeared to confer a kind of precedence on the old altar, drew it back again, and fixed it on the north side of his new altar.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:10-16 God's altar had hitherto been kept in its place, and in use; but Ahaz put another in the room of it. The natural regard of the mind of man to some sort of religion, is not easily extinguished; but except it be regulated by the word, and by the Spirit of God, it produces absurd superstitions, or detestable idolatries. Or, at best, it quiets the sinner's conscience with unmeaning ceremonies. Infidels have often been remarkable for believing ridiculous falsehoods.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hereto the "Brasen altar" (marginal reference) had, it would seem, occupied a position directly in front of the temple porch, which it exactly equalled in width. Now Ahaz removed it from this place, and gave the honorable position to his new altar, which he designed to supersede the old far all ordinary purposes <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-15.htm">2 Kings 16:15</a>.<p>From between the altar ... - Urijah, having received no official directions, had placed the new altar in front of the old, between it and the eastern gate of the court.

And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser&#8212;This was a visit of respect, and perhaps of gratitude. During his stay in that heathen city, Ahaz saw an altar with which he was greatly captivated. Forthwith a sketch of it was transmitted to Jerusalem, with orders to Urijah the priest to get one constructed according to the Damascus model, and let this new altar supersede the old one in the temple. Urijah, with culpable complaisance, acted according to his instructions (2Ki 16:16). The sin in this affair consisted in meddling with, and improving according to human taste and fancy, the altars of the temple, the patterns of which had been furnished by divine authority (Ex 25:40; 26:30; 27:1; 1Ch 28:19). Urijah was one of the witnesses taken by Isaiah to bear his prediction against Syria and Israel (Isa 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The brazen altar of burnt-offerings, </span> made by Solomon, and placed there by God’s appointment.

This arrangement Ahaz changes, and taking away the brasen altar, he leaves his own in the front of the temple, and carries the older and more sacred altar to the north side of the new one. Thus they both stood in a line parallel to the front of the house, but the king’s new altar had the place of honour, before the temple-doors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">north side of the</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">his</span>] <span class="ital">altar</span>] As before.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he brought also the brazen altar, which was before the Lord.</span> One sin leads on to another. Having introduced his self-invented <span class="accented">quasi-idolatrous</span> altar into the temple, and so inserted "the thin end of the wedge," Ahaz was not satisfied, but proceeded to another innovation. Urijah, having had no express order from the king with respect to the position of the new altar, had placed it in front of the old one, between it and the eastern gate of the court. Thus the old altar, which was directly in front of the temple porch, seemed to cut the new altar off from the temple. Ahaz would not have this continue, and resolved on removing the altar of Solomon from, its place, and putting it elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">From the forefront of the house</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a>), <span class="cmt_word">from between the altar</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the new altar - <span class="cmt_word">and the house of the Lord</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the temple building - <span class="cmt_word">and put it on the north side of the altar.</span> The removal of Solomon's altar from its place of honor to a side position left the space clear between the temple and the new altar, which thus, without exactly occupying the same site, took practically the place of Solomon's altar. Solomon's altar, shifted to one side, was put, as it were, in the background; the eye rested on the new altar, right in front of the porch and temple, which so became "the main altar" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>), as it is called in the next verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this distress Ahaz turned to Tiglath-pileser, without regarding either the word of Isaiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-4.htm">2 Kings 7:4</a>., which promised salvation, or the prophet's warning against an alliance with Assyria, and by sending the gold and silver which were found in the treasures of the temple and palace, purchased his assistance against Rezin and Pekah. Whether this occurred immediately after the invasion of the land by the allied kings, or not till after they had defeated the Judaean army and advanced against Jerusalem, it is impossible to discover either from this verse or from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-16.htm">2 Chronicles 28:16</a>; but probably it was after the first great victory gained by the foe, with which <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a> and 8 agree. - On &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; see Ewald, 151, b. </body></html>
