It is noticeable that he and not Jehoiada takes the initiative in the matter.

The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No money had for some time been brought in (marginal reference "g"). Perhaps it was difficult for the priests and Levites to know exactly what proportion of the money paid to them was fairly applicable to the temple service and to their own support; and what, consequently, was the balance which they ought to apply to the repairs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Jehoash said to the priests, &c.&#8212;There is here given an account of the measures which the young king took for repairing the temple by the levying of taxes: 1. "The money of every one that passeth the account," namely, half a shekel, as "an offering to the Lord" (Ex 30:13). 2. "The money that every man is set at," that is, the redemption price of every one who had devoted himself or any thing belonging to him to the Lord, and the amount of which was estimated according to certain rules (Le 27:1-8). 3. Free will or voluntary offerings made to the sanctuary. The first two were paid annually (see 2Ch 24:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either because the people were generally corrupt and backward to the worship of God, especially where it cost them any thing; or because the persons employed in making the collections were negligent, or unfaithful, perverting the money received to their own uses, as may seem probable from the contrary character of other persons, of whom it is noted that they dealt faithfully, below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-15.htm" title="Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.">2 Kings 12:15</a></span>; or because the people did not like this way of collection, and had no good opinion of the collectors’ faithfulness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But it was so, that in the twenty and third year of King Jehoash, the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. Either the people being backward to pay in the money, or the priests converted it to their own use: or, however, were negligent of doing the work enjoined them by the king, either in collecting the money, or in using it as they were directed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">In the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash</span>] By which time he must have attained the age of thirty and was able to act with decision. According to the Chronicler the first order had been, ‘See that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not’. That account also makes Jehoiada more personally responsible than he is here represented to have been. ‘The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the priests had not repaired the breaches</span>] We are not told why this was so, though the king asked the question. They had evidently been receiving the money, for the king’s order in the next verse is ‘Take no more money’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of King Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.</span> No charge is made against the priests of malversation or embezzlement. They had simply been negligent. Probably very little money had come in; and they had not been very active in their endeavors to obtain larger contributions. It must be remembered that what went to the fabric fund would, for the most part, be a deduction from the ordinary revenue of the temple, which was not, perhaps, much in excess of the ordinary demands upon it. We can, therefore, quite understand that the king's policy would not be popular with the priests (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>). Still, it is to be observed that they are not said to have executed no repairs, but only not to have "made haste" and completed their task by the time that the king looked for its completion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And he took the captains, and they brought the king down out of the house of Jehovah, etc. The word &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; is not to be pressed, but simply affirms that Jehoiada entrusted the persons named with the duty of conducting the king into his palace. Beside the captains over a hundred (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>) there are mentioned &#1493;&#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, i.e., the royal halberdiers (the body-guard), who had passed over to the new king immediately after the fall of Athaliah and now followed their captains, and &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501;, all the rest of the people assembled. Instead of the halberdiers there are mentioned in the Chronicles &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, the nobles and lords in the nation-a completion implied in the facts themselves, since Jehoiada had drawn the heads of the nation into his plan, and on the other hand the express allusion to the body-guard might be omitted as of inferior importance. We cannot infer from &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; that the bridge between Moriah and Zion was not yet in existence, as Thenius supposes, but simply that the bridge was lower than the temple-courts. Instead of &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, the gate of the runners (i.e., of the halberdiers), we find in the Chronicles &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, the upper gate, which appears to have been a gate of the temple, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>. The statement that they came by the way of the runners' gate into the house of the king is not at variance with this, for it may be understood as meaning that it was by the halberdiers' gate of the temple that the entry into the palace was carried out. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-20.htm">2 Kings 11:20</a> this account is concluded with the general remark that all the people rejoiced, sc. at the coronation of Joash, and the city was quiet, when they slew Athaliah with the sword. This is the way, so far as the sense is concerned, in which the last two clauses are to be connected. </body></html>
