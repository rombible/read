The change initiated by Jehoash consisted in this, that henceforth gifts intended for the sanctuary itself were kept apart from the gifts intended for the priesthood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-16.htm" title="The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.">2 Kings 12:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">The trespass-money and sin-money, </span>&c. — “Besides the money paid to the priests for trespasses committed in holy things it is thought that persons living at a distance sent money to the priests to purchase trespass- offerings and sin-offerings, and sacrifice them in their names: and, as they commonly sent more than the sacrifices cost, the surplus became a perquisite, under the name of <span class="ital">trespass-money </span>and <span class="ital">sin-money.” — </span>Scott.

The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The trespass money and the sin money - In all cases of injury done to another, a man was bound by the Law to make compensation, to the sufferer, if possible; if not, to his nearest kinsman.
