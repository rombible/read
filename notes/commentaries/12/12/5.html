However, the Levites hastened it not.">2Chronicles 24:5</a>. From that passage it is evident that the chronicler understood that the priests were required to collect such moneys, each in his own city and district, year by year. Our text, taken alone, would seem to imply that persons going to the Temple to have the value of vows estimated, or to make free-will offerings, resorted to the priests whom they knew.

The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The collection was not to be made in Jerusalem only, but in all "the cities of Judah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>; the various priests and Levites being collectors in their own neighborhoods.<p>Breaches - The word in the original includes every kind and degree of ruin or dilapidation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

"The money of every one that passeth the account," namely, half a shekel, as "an offering to the Lord" (Ex 30:13). 2. "The money that every man is set at," that is, the redemption price of every one who had devoted himself or any thing belonging to him to the Lord, and the amount of which was estimated according to certain rules (Le 27:1-8). 3.

From 2 Kings it might be thought that the words of Jehoash applied to such offerings as were made at the temple, and then it would be hard to see what a man’s acquaintance had to do with such a matter. But in 2 Chron. we are told that the priests and Levites were bidden ‘to go out unto the cities of Judah and gather money of all Israel’. Hence nothing was more natural than that each should go among the people to whom he was best known, and from whom he would have the best chance of bringing in contributions, Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> IX. 8. 2) says that ‘the priests and Levites were sent through the whole land to ask <span class="ital">half a shekel from each person</span> for the furniture and restoration of the temple, which had been broken up by Joram and Athaliah and her sons’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and let them repair</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">they shall repair</span>. This is literal, and besides allows more emphasis to be given to the pronoun ‘they’ which is placed in a marked position in the original. The wish of the king at first was to put the whole matter in the charge of the priest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the breaches</span>] The Hebrew word, which the LXX. merely transliterates (<span class="greekheb">βεδέκ</span>), is found only in this chapter and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-5.htm" title="And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,">2 Kings 22:5</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm" title="The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-27.htm" title="Your riches, and your fairs, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your caulkers, and the occupiers of your merchandise, and all your men of war, that are in you, and in all your company which is in the middle of you, shall fall into the middle of the seas in the day of your ruin.">Ezekiel 27:27</a>. But in the last-mentioned passages it is used of the filling up, by calking, of the chinks in ships. Hence we can understand the sort of decay which had taken place in the temple-building. Years of neglect had allowed the walls to crumble and crack and similar damages to arise in every part.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance.</span> The money was to be gathered of "all Israel," out of all "the cities of Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>). The priests of each locality were to be the collectors, and would therefore gather "of their acquaintance." As we cannot suppose that very much would accrue from either the first or second source, since a census was rarely taken, and personal vows were not very common, we must regard the command of Joash as, in the main, the authorization of a general collection throughout the kingdom of voluntary contributions towards the temple repairs, and so as analogous to the "letters" which our own sovereigns, or archbishops, issue from time to time for collections in churches for special objects. <span class="cmt_word">And let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.</span> The "breaches," or dilapidations, may have been caused, partly by the neglect of necessary repairs during the reigns of Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Athaliah; but they were mainly the result of the willful violence of Athaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>). Apparently, the damage done must have been very great. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And he took the captains, and they brought the king down out of the house of Jehovah, etc. The word &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; is not to be pressed, but simply affirms that Jehoiada entrusted the persons named with the duty of conducting the king into his palace. Beside the captains over a hundred (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>) there are mentioned &#1493;&#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, i.e., the royal halberdiers (the body-guard), who had passed over to the new king immediately after the fall of Athaliah and now followed their captains, and &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501;, all the rest of the people assembled. Instead of the halberdiers there are mentioned in the Chronicles &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, the nobles and lords in the nation-a completion implied in the facts themselves, since Jehoiada had drawn the heads of the nation into his plan, and on the other hand the express allusion to the body-guard might be omitted as of inferior importance. We cannot infer from &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; that the bridge between Moriah and Zion was not yet in existence, as Thenius supposes, but simply that the bridge was lower than the temple-courts. Instead of &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, the gate of the runners (i.e., of the halberdiers), we find in the Chronicles &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, the upper gate, which appears to have been a gate of the temple, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>. The statement that they came by the way of the runners' gate into the house of the king is not at variance with this, for it may be understood as meaning that it was by the halberdiers' gate of the temple that the entry into the palace was carried out. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-20.htm">2 Kings 11:20</a> this account is concluded with the general remark that all the people rejoiced, sc. at the coronation of Joash, and the city was quiet, when they slew Athaliah with the sword. This is the way, so far as the sense is concerned, in which the last two clauses are to be connected. </body></html>
