(The accent dividing the verse ought to fall on “the Lord” rather than on “his days.”) Perhaps the peculiar form of the sentence arose in this way: the writer first set down the usual statement concerning kings who supported the worship of Jehovah, and then, remembering the evils which ensued upon the death of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm" title="Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.">2Chronicles 24:17</a>), added as a correction of that statement, “during which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.” Thenius says the words <span class= "ital">can</span> only be rendered, <span class= "ital">all his life long, because Jehoiada had instructed him</span>. They certainly <span class= "ital">can</span>, however, be rendered as our version renders them, and further, thus: “And Jehoash did . . . all his days, <span class= "ital">whom Jehoiada the priest instructed.”</span> But the ambiguity of the statement gave an opportunity for discrediting the chronicler.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-2.htm" title="And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.">2 Kings 12:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jehoash did what was right, </span>&c. — Having, 1st, such a good director as Jehoiada was, so wise, experienced, and faithful: and, 2d, so much wisdom as to hearken to him, and be directed by him. Here we learn of what advantage it is to princes, especially while they are young, and indeed to young people in general, to have good instructers and counsellors about them.

The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All his days ... - i. e., so long as Jehoiada was his adviser" (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-15.htm">2 Chronicles 24:15-22</a>). Jehoida was, practically speaking, regent during the minority of Jehoash, i. e., 10 or 12 years. An increase of power to the priestly order was the natural consequence. Jehoiada bore the title of "high priest" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-10.htm">2 Kings 12:10</a>, which had been dropped since the time of Eleazar <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a>, and the Levitical order from this time became more mixed up with public affairs and possessed greater influence than previously.

Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord&#8212;so far as related to his outward actions and the policy of his government. But it is evident from the sequel of his history that the rectitude of his administration was owing more to the salutary influence of his preserver and tutor, Jehoiada, than to the honest and sincere dictates of his own mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, for the matter of it, though not with an honest and sincere mind, but only by the influence of his good tutor and restorer, as the words here following plainly imply. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days,....

This statement that Jehoash did what was right <span class="ital">all his days</span> is opposed to the narrative in Chronicles. The LXX. appears not to have had ‘his’ in connexion with ‘days’, for the rendering is ‘he did what was right all the days during which Jehoiada instructed him’. The necessity for being consistent with Chronicles has led to the rendering of the relative by ‘wherein’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.</span> So the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Luther, De Wette, Keil, Bahr, and our Revisers. Only Ewald and Thenius attempt to make the passage contradict Chronicles by translating, "Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days, because Jehoiada the priest had instructed him." But this translation is very forced and unnatural. The writer evidently intended to add a qualifying clause to his statement that Joash reigned well "all his days," but did not wish to draw too much attention to it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Renewal of the covenant, extermination of the worship of Baal, and entrance of the king into the palace. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>. After Jehoash was crowned and Athaliah put to death, Jehoiada concluded the covenant (1) between Jehovah on the one hand and the king and people on the other, and (2) between the king and the people. The former was simply a renewal of the covenant which the Lord had made with Israel through Moses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>), whereby the king and the people bound themselves &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., to live as the people of the Lord, or to keep His law (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-9.htm">Deuteronomy 27:9-10</a>), and was based upon the "testimony" handed to the king. This covenant naturally led to the covenant between the king and the people, whereby the king bound himself to rule his people according to the law of the Lord, and the people vowed that they would be obedient and subject to the king as the ruler appointed by the Lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>). The renewal of the covenant with the Lord was necessary, because under the former kings the people had fallen away from the Lord and served Baal. The immediate consequence of the renewal of the covenant, therefore, was the extermination of the worship of Baal, which is mentioned at once in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>, although its proper place in order of time is after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>. All the people (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>) went to the temple of Baal, threw down his altars, broke his images (the columns of Baal and Astarte) rightly, i.e., completely (&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>), and slew the priest Mattan, probably the chief priest of Baal, before his altars. That the temple of Baal stood within the limits of the sanctuary, i.e., of the temple of Jehovah (Thenius), cannot be shown to be probable either from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a> or from the last clause of this verse. (For <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a> see the fuller remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>.) The words "and the priest set overseers over the house of Jehovah" do not affirm that Jehoiada created the office of overseer over the temple for the purpose of guarding against a fresh desecration of the temple by idolatry (Thenius), but simply that he appointed overseers over the temple, namely, priests and Levites entrusted with the duty of watching over the performance of worship according to the precepts of the law, as is more minutely described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>. </body></html>
