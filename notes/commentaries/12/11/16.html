The rendering of the A.V. agrees with the LXX. and the Vulgate. But the verb here used is not that employed for such an act as the arrest here described would be. It is better therefore to adopt the translation of the Targum followed by Jewish and many modern commentators, ‘They gave room to her on both hands’.

He says she was put to death "at the gate of the king's mules," but does not mark the locality. The gate intended can scarcely be the "horse gate" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a>, which was in the eastern wall, and north of the temple. It was probably a gate on the western side of the Tyropoeon valley, giving entrance to the stables of the palace (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-15.htm">2 Chronicles 23:15</a>, and see below, ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">And there was she slain</span>; "with the sword" (ver. 20).

The high priest gave the captains "the spears and shields (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>) which (belonged) to king David, that were in the house of Jehovah," i.e., the weapons which David had presented to the sanctuary as dedicatory offerings. Instead of &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; we ought probably to read &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1514; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>), after the &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; of the Chronicles, since the collective force of &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; is very improbable in prose, and a &#1514; might easily drop out through a copyist's error. Jehoiada gave the captains weapons from the temple, because, as has been already observed, they had come unarmed, and not, as Thenius imagines, to provide them with old and sacred weapons instead of their ordinary ones. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-11.htm">2 Kings 11:11</a> the position of all the divisions is given in a comprehensive manner, for the purpose of appending the further course of the affair, namely, the coronation of the king. "Thus the halberdiers stood, every one with his weapons in his hand, from the right wing of the house to the left wing, towards the altar (of burnt-offering) and the (temple-) house, round about the king," i.e., to cover the king on all sides. For it is evident that we are not to understand &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; as signifying the encircling of the king, from the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>, according to which Jehoiada did not bring out the king's son till after the men had taken up their positions. The use of &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, to signify the captains with the armed priests and Levites put under their command for this purpose, is an uncommon one, but it may be explained from the fact that &#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; had retained the general meaning of royal halberdiers; and the priests and Levites under the command of the captains of the royal body-guard by this very act discharged the duty of the royal body-guard itself. The chronicler has used the indefinite expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;-haa`aam, the whole of the people assembled in the temple-court.</body></html>
