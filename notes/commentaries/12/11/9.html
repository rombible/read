Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out.

Having revealed to them the secret of the young king's preservation and entered into a covenant with them for the overthrow of the tyrant, he then arranged with them the plan and time of carrying their plot into execution (see on [336]2Ch 22:10-23:21). The conduct of Jehoiada, who acted the leading and chief part in this conspiracy, admits of an easy and full justification; for, while Athaliah was a usurper, and belonged to a race destined by divine denunciation to destruction, even his own wife had a better and stronger claim to the throne; the sovereignty of Judah had been divinely appropriated to the family of David, and therefore the young prince on whom it was proposed to confer the crown, possessed an inherent right to it, of which a usurper could not deprive him. Moreover, Jehoiada was most probably the high priest, whose official duty it was to watch over the due execution of God's laws, and who in his present movement, was encouraged and aided by the countenance and support of the chief authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, in the country. In addition to all these considerations, he seems to have been directed by an impulse of the Divine Spirit, through the counsels and exhortations of the prophets of the time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded,....

The LXX. instead of any rendering of the word for ‘priest’ has <span class="greekheb">ὁ συνετός</span>.

The Chronicler, writing much later, gives Jehoiada the title on the first occasion that he mentions him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>). When it is said that "<span class="accented">all</span> the captains took their men and came to Jehoiada," the intention is to mark their exact obedience to the orders given them. Strictly speaking, only two out of the five actually appeared before Jehoiada on the day of the execution of his project, two divisions only having been summoned to come to the temple (ver. 7). The other three took up the positions assigned them in and about the royal palace. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Government of Athaliah (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-10.htm">2 Chronicles 22:10-12</a>). After the death of Ahaziah of Judah, his mother Athaliah, a daughter of Ahab and Jezebel (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>), seized upon the government, by putting to death all the king's descendants with the exception of Joash, a son of Ahaziah of only a year old, who had been secretly carried off from the midst of the royal children, who were put to death, by Jehosheba, his father's sister, the wife of the high priest Jehoiada, and was first of all hidden with his nurse in the bed-chamber, and afterwards kept concealed from Athaliah for six years in the high priest's house. The &#1493; before &#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; is no doubt original, the subject, Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah, being placed at the head absolutely, and a circumstantial clause introduced with &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;: "Athaliah, when she saw that, etc., rose up." &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, all the royal seed, i.e., all the sons and relations of Ahaziah, who could put in any claim to succeed to the throne. At the same time there were hardly any other direct descendants of the royal family in existence beside the sons of Ahaziah, since the elder brothers of Ahaziah had been carried away by the Arabs and put to death, and the rest of the closer blood-relations of the male sex had been slain by Jehu (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm">2 Kings 10:13</a>). - Jehosheba (&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;, in the Chronicles &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;), the wife of the high priest Jehoiada (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>), was a daughter of king Joram and a sister of Ahaziah, but she was most likely not a daughter of Athaliah, as this worshipper of Baal would hardly have allowed her own daughter to marry the high priest, but had been born to Joram by a wife of the second rank. &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; (Chethb), generally a substantive, mortes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-8.htm">Ezekiel 28:8</a>), here an adjective: slain or set apart for death. The Keri &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; is the participle Hophal, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>. &#1492;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1512; is to be taken in connection with &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;: she stole him (took him away secretly) from the rest of the king's sons, who were about to be put to death, into the chamber of the beds, i.e., not the children's bed-room, but a room in the palace where the beds (mattresses and counterpanes) were kept, for which in the East there is a special room that is not used as a dwelling-room (see Chardin in Harm. Beobb. iii. p. 357). This was the place in which at first it was easiest to conceal the child and its nurse. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "they (Jehosheba and the nurse) concealed him," is not to be altered into &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; after the Chronicles, as Thenius maintains. The masculine is used in the place of the feminine, as is frequently the case. Afterwards he was concealed with her (with Jehosheba) in the house of Jehovah, i.e., in the home of the high-priest in one of the buildings of the court of the temple. </body></html>
