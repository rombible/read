No doubt there was a strong element of Baal-worshippers and partisans of Athaliah in the capital. “The people of the land” (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, probably, the people whom the centurions had called together from the country, at the instance of Jehoiada, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-2.htm" title="And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 23:2</a>) are contrasted with the burghers of Jerusalem. The phrase, “the city was in quiet” (or “had rest,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might.

It is well with a people, when all the changes that pass over them help to revive, strengthen, and advance the interests of religion among them. Covenants are of use, both to remind us of, and bind us to, the duties already binding on us. They immediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with one another, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The people rejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet. The way for people to be joyful and at peace, is to engage fully in the service of God; for the voice of joy and thanksgiving is in the dwellings of the righteous, but there is no peace for the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They slew Athaliah with the sword - This is one of the many little repetitions which mark the manner of the writer, and which generally contain some little point which has not been mentioned before (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-16.htm">2 Kings 11:16</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 11:17-20.

The covenant between the king and the people was the consequence of this, and by it the king bound himself to rule according to the divine law, while the people engaged to submit, to give him allegiance as the Lord's anointed. The immediate fruit of this renewal of the covenant was the destruction of the temple and the slaughter of the priests of Baal (see 2Ki 10:27); the restoration of the pure worship of God in all its ancient integrity; and the establishment of the young king on the hereditary throne of Judah [2Ki 11:19].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the people of the land rejoiced,....

The <span class="accented">whole land</span> was content with the revolution that had taken place. No opposition showed itself. Ewald has no ground for his statement that the heathenizing party was strong in Jerusalem, and that the worshippers of Jehovah "had for a long time to keep watch in the temple, to prevent surprise by the heathenizing party" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 136, note 3). He has mistaken the intention of the last clause of ver. 18.
