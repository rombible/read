The troops of the royal guard regularly succeeded each other on duty just as they do in modern European capitals. That the Sabbath was the day on which they relieved each other is known only from this passage; but the priestly and Levitical guilds did the same, and their organisation in many ways resembled that of an army.<p><span class= "bld">The watch of the king’s house.</span>—There were two places to be occupied for the success of the present movement—viz., the royal palace and the Temple, “the king’s house” and “the house of the Lord.” In the former was Athaliah, the usurping queen, whose movements must be closely watched, and whose adherents must be prevented from occupying and defending the palace; in the latter, the young heir to the throne, who must be protected from attack. That “the king’s house” here means the palace proper is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-16.htm" title="And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.">2Kings 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm" title="And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house.

The LXX. adds, “at the entry” (<span class= "greekheb">ἐν τῷ πυλῶνι</span>)—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the grand entrance to the palace itself.

Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out.

Three of the five divisions "enter in" on the Sabbath; the other two "go forth" on the Sabbath <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a>. By the former phrase seems to be meant the mounting guard at the royal palace (the "king's house," where Athaliah then was); by the latter the serving of escort to the sovereign beyond the palace bounds. Jehoiada orders that of those whose business it would be to guard the palace on the ensuing Sabbath, one company or cohort should perform that task in the ordinary way, while another should watch the gate of Sur - or better, "the gate of the foundation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a> - that by which the palace was usually quitted for the temple, and a third should watch another of the palace gates, called "the gate of the guard" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>). The two companies whose proper business it would be to serve as the royal escort beyond the palace walls, he orders to enter the temple, and surround the person of the young king.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 11:4-12. He Is Made King.<p>4. the seventh year&#8212;namely, of the reign of Athaliah, and the rescue of Jehoash.<p>Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers, &c.&#8212;He could scarcely have obtained such a general convocation except at the time, or on pretext, of a public and solemn festival. Having revealed to them the secret of the young king's preservation and entered into a covenant with them for the overthrow of the tyrant, he then arranged with them the plan and time of carrying their plot into execution (see on [336]2Ch 22:10-23:21). The conduct of Jehoiada, who acted the leading and chief part in this conspiracy, admits of an easy and full justification; for, while Athaliah was a usurper, and belonged to a race destined by divine denunciation to destruction, even his own wife had a better and stronger claim to the throne; the sovereignty of Judah had been divinely appropriated to the family of David, and therefore the young prince on whom it was proposed to confer the crown, possessed an inherent right to it, of which a usurper could not deprive him. Moreover, Jehoiada was most probably the high priest, whose official duty it was to watch over the due execution of God's laws, and who in his present movement, was encouraged and aided by the countenance and support of the chief authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, in the country. In addition to all these considerations, he seems to have been directed by an impulse of the Divine Spirit, through the counsels and exhortations of the prophets of the time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A third part of you; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="bld">A third part of you</span>, (i.e. of the whole number, including those <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that come in</span> and those <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that go out on the sabbath</span>,) even <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">they that enter in on the sabbath</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and so the two other third parts were to consist of those that went out on the sabbath, as some gather from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-6.htm" title="And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.">2 Kings 11:6</a>,7</span>.

These duties Jehoiada deputed to the five captains whom he had taken into his confidence. Three bodies of men, presumably each under a captain, are to watch the palace at different points, while two other bodies are to be in charge of the house of the Lord about the king. It is not without interest to observe that this fivefold division of the guards corresponds to the number of the captains selected, though they and their number are only mentioned in the narrative of 2 Chronicles. We see from this, that although we may not, at this distance of time, be able to make clear every detail of the two stories, they fit here very remarkably into each other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a third</span> part <span class="ital">of you that enter</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">come</span>] <span class="ital">in on the sabbath</span>] Those who are to take part in the work that is planned are to be the guards who enter on their duty on the Sabbath, and those who are going off duty. As the words are addressed to the captains over hundreds the ‘of you’ must apply to the soldiers under their command. But it is perfectly intelligible that a somewhat similar arrangement of the Levites might also be made, and that they should take their part in work of restoring the king. From the narrative in 2 Chronicles we see that the priests and Levites were arranged in 3 divisions, one of which was to have the duty of porters, as it seems, at the doors of the temple, another to be at the king’s house, and the third at the gate of the foundation. On this last position see below. Thus, as in the case of the purely military arrangement, the larger number of the priestly and Levitical body was to serve near the royal palace. We note also from Chronicles that the occasion of some feast was arranged as the time for carrying out the plan. For it is said that ‘all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall even be keepers of the watch of the king’s house</span>] R.V. omits ‘even’. The LXX. adds ‘at the doorway’ in the end of this clause. No doubt they would be stationed so as to prevent any one from the palace coming forth, without their consent, to interfere with the proceedings at the temple.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do.</span> It is evident, from 2 Chronicles and from Josephus, that a considerable interval of time separates the events of ver. 5 from those of ver. 4. The <span class="accented">immediate</span> arrangement made between Jehoiada and the centurions was that they should "go throughout the whole land" (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 2), visit "all the cities of Judah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), and gather out of them a strong force of Levites and priests (Josephus), together with a certain number of other representative Israelites, which force they should bring with them to Jerusalem, and place at his disposal. To accomplish this must have taken some weeks. When the force had arrived, Jehoiada summoned it to meet him in the courts of the temple, and swore it to a similar covenant to that which he had made with the centurions. He then bided his time, completed his arrangements, utilized the store of arms laid up in the temple armory (ver. 10), and finally gave two charges - one to the centurions, which is given here (vers. 5-8), and the other to the force collected from the cities of Judah, which is given in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>). The orders given to the two forces were very similar, but not identical. <span class="cmt_word">A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath.</span> The royal body-guard consisted of five divisions, each probably of a hundred men, and each commanded by its own captain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>). It was usual on the sabbath for three divisions out of the five to mount guard at the royal palace, while two were engaged outside, keeping order in the city, and especially at the temple. We do not know the ordinary disposition of the guard, either inside or outside the palace. On this occasion Jehoiada commanded that the palace-guard should be disposed as follows: one division at the palace proper, in the courts and halls and antechambers; a second at one of the issues from the palace, known as "the gate of Sur;" and a third at an issue called "the gate of the guard," which was certainly towards the east, where the palace fronted the temple. The object was to secure the palace, but not to prevent the queen from leaving it. <span class="cmt_word">Shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the royal palace. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Conclusion of the history of Jehu's reign.
