In the fervour of their newly-awakened enthusiasm for Jehovah, the assembly may have hurried off at once to the work of demolition. It seems to be implied that the “house of Baal” stood on the Temple mount, in ostentatious rivalry with the sanctuary of Jehovah.

This house of Baal had, perhaps, been built by Athaliah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1Kings 16:31-32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">His altars . . . his images.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">its</span> (the Temple’s) <span class= "ital">altars . . . its images.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord.</span>—The obviously close connection of this statement with what precedes, almost proves that the sanctuary of Baal had stood within the Temple precincts, probably in the outer court. After the destruction of it, Jehoiada appointed certain overseers—probably Levites of rank—to prevent any future desecration of the Temple by the practice of idolatrous rites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/8-5.htm" title="Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.

It is well with a people, when all the changes that pass over them help to revive, strengthen, and advance the interests of religion among them. Covenants are of use, both to remind us of, and bind us to, the duties already binding on us. They immediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with one another, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The people rejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet. The way for people to be joyful and at peace, is to engage fully in the service of God; for the voice of joy and thanksgiving is in the dwellings of the righteous, but there is no peace for the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A temple had been built to Baal at Jerusalem itself by Athaliah, Ahaziah, or Jehoram.

Jehoiada Restores God's Worship.<p>17, 18. a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people&#8212;The covenant with the Lord was a renewal of the national covenant with Israel (Ex 19:1-24:18; "to be unto him a people of inheritance," De 4:6; 27:9). The covenant between the king and the people was the consequence of this, and by it the king bound himself to rule according to the divine law, while the people engaged to submit, to give him allegiance as the Lord's anointed. The immediate fruit of this renewal of the covenant was the destruction of the temple and the slaughter of the priests of Baal (see 2Ki 10:27); the restoration of the pure worship of God in all its ancient integrity; and the establishment of the young king on the hereditary throne of Judah [2Ki 11:19].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Before the altar; </span> to which possibly he fled for refuge; or rather, he was brought thither as a fit sacrifice to his God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Officers over the house of the Lord; </span> of which see more particularly, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-18.htm" title="Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.">2 Chronicles 23:18</a>,19</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the people of the land,....

We are told also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm" title="For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow on Baalim.">2 Chronicles 24:7</a> that the sons of Athaliah had broken up (i.e. broken into) the house of God, and bestowed the dedicated things of the house of the Lord upon the Baalim. It is clear from this that the house of Baal was not any portion of the temple which had been appropriated to the idolatrous worship, but a separate building, into which spoils from the temple had been conveyed. It may have been on the same hill with the temple, though of that we cannot be certain. There can however be no doubt that the Baal worship had not extended largely in Judah. Hence the readiness of the people of the land, called to Jerusalem by some festival, to go to the Baalite edifice and destroy it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">brake they in pieces throughly</span>] That there should be no chance of a restoration. The multitude were no doubt helped in their destruction by the military force with which, in these doings, they had been in such close combination.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Mattan the priest of Baal</span>] We read of no other priest of Baal in Judah, and so we may conclude that though the court favoured idolatry, it found no great favour with the rest of the kingdom. Otherwise we should have heard of an array of priests like that of Jezebel in Samaria.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord</span>] From this necessity we may gather that the regular ministrations in the temple had been interfered with by the introduction of the Baalim. The Chronicler gives fuller details on this matter, and the two accounts have so much verbal similarity in other parts that we cannot avoid the conclusion that both writers used a common source of information. He says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/23-18.htm" title="Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David....">2 Chronicles 23:18-19</a>) ‘Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the Lord, to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, <span class="ital">as it was ordained by</span> David. And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people of the land</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all those who had come up to Jerusalem from the various cities of Judah to help Jehoiada (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">went into the house of Baal.</span> According to Josephus, "the house of Baal" here mentioned was built by Jehoram and Athaliah in the reign of the former ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 4), But, if this was the case, it is rather strange that the writer of Chronicles, who enumerates so many of the evil acts of Jehoram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4, 6, 11</a>), does not mention it. The present narrative shows that the temple was in, or very near, Jerusalem; but there is nothing to fix the site of it. <span class="cmt_word">And brake it down</span> - Josephus says they "razed it to the ground" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly.</span> It was common among the heathen to have several altars in one temple, and not uncommon to have several images even of the same god, especially if he was a god worshipped under different forms, as Baal was (whence the word "Baalim"). The Baalim of this temple are mentioned by the writer of Chronicles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</span> The name "Mattan" recalls that of the last King of Judah, which was originally Mattaniah, equivalent to "gift of Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Mattan would be simply "gift." We may presume that, though only called "priest," he was the high priest. <span class="cmt_word">And the priest</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiada  - <span class="cmt_word">appointed officers over the house of the Lord.</span> The parallel passage of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18, 19</a>) explains this statement. We are there told that "Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the priests the Levites... to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David. And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which was unclean in anything should enter in." During Athaliah's reign the temple service had ceased; breaches had been broken in the outer walls; and neither the priests nor the porters had served in their regular order; there had been no morning or evening sacrifice, and no antiphonal psalm-singing. Jehoiada re-established the regular courses and the worship. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the approaches to the temple had all been occupied in this manner, Jehoiada brought out the king's son from his home in the temple; or, he brought him forth, set the crown upon him, and handed him the testimony, i.e., the book of the law, as the rule of his life and action as king, according to the precept in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is connected with &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, because &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; has the general meaning "delivered to him, handed him," and does not specially affirm the putting on of the crown. &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, they made him king. The subject is the persons present, through, as a matter of course, the anointing was performed by Jehoiada and the priests, as the Chronicles expressly affirm.
