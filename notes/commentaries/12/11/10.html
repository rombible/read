The arms which David had laid up in the Temple as spoils of war were now to be used, appropriately enough, for the restoration of David’s heir to the throne. Possibly, as Bähr suggests, the guards who came off duty at the palace had left their weapons there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-10.htm" title="And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.">2 Kings 11:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">To the captains did the priest give King David’s spears and shields — </span>Offensive and defensive weapons, both for themselves and for all their soldiers; for they had all come into the temple unarmed, to prevent suspicion.

Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out.

Having revealed to them the secret of the young king's preservation and entered into a covenant with them for the overthrow of the tyrant, he then arranged with them the plan and time of carrying their plot into execution (see on [336]2Ch 22:10-23:21). The conduct of Jehoiada, who acted the leading and chief part in this conspiracy, admits of an easy and full justification; for, while Athaliah was a usurper, and belonged to a race destined by divine denunciation to destruction, even his own wife had a better and stronger claim to the throne; the sovereignty of Judah had been divinely appropriated to the family of David, and therefore the young prince on whom it was proposed to confer the crown, possessed an inherent right to it, of which a usurper could not deprive him. Moreover, Jehoiada was most probably the high priest, whose official duty it was to watch over the due execution of God's laws, and who in his present movement, was encouraged and aided by the countenance and support of the chief authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, in the country. In addition to all these considerations, he seems to have been directed by an impulse of the Divine Spirit, through the counsels and exhortations of the prophets of the time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Spears and shields; </span> offensive and defensive weapons, which he gave to the captains, both for themselves, and for all their soldiers; for they all came into the temple unarmed, to prevent suspicion.

Thus the English is made to correspond to the Hebrew order more closely, and to the translation in 2 Chron. It is to be observed that both accounts agree about the weapons being delivered to the soldiery by Jehoiada, thus making clear that to both compilers it was known that the whole undertaking was controlled by the guard and not by the priests and Levites, though, as his manner is, the writer of Chronicles puts them in the forefront as much as he can.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">king David’s stears and shields</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the spears and shields that had been king David’s</span>. This is the form in 2 Chronicles, except that there ‘bucklers’ are mentioned between ‘spears’ and ‘shields’. These weapons were those which David in his wars had taken from his enemies, and stored probably in the chambers round the temple. For the practice of so devoting the weapons of the conquered cf. the sword of Goliath laid up in store with Ahimelech at Nob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm" title="And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here.

Of course it means ‘temple’, but the English reader might suppose that the original had here a different word. The same change has to be made in the next verse, three times over; and in the parallel verse in 2 Chron.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give King David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the Lord.</span> We hear of David carrying with him to Jerusalem the "shields of gold," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shields ornamented with gold, which he took from the servants of Hadadezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>); but otherwise we are not told of his establishing an armory. Solomon made six hundred shields of solid gold, and laid them up in the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>); but these were carried off by Sheshonk, when he invaded Judaea in the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>). Rehoboam, in their place, made three hundred brazen shields (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>), which, however, were deposited in the guard-chamber of the royal palace. Of spears collected by David, and laid up in the temple, we know nothing beyond the present passage. There can be little doubt that the weapons were brought forth from their receptacle with the view (as Ewald says) of "consecrating the work of the restoration of the Davidic house with the sacred arms of the great founder himself" (see 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 136) - not, however, with arms that he had worn, but with some which he had collected and laid up. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Dethronement of Athaliah and Coronation of Joash (compare the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23.htm">2 Chronicles 23</a>, which is more elaborate in several points).<p>(Note: In both accounts we have only short extracts preserved from a common and more complete original, the extracts having been made quite independently of one another and upon different plans. Hence the apparent discrepancies, which have arisen partly from the incompleteness of the two abridged accounts, and partly from the different points of view from which the extracts were made, but which contain no irreconcilable contradictions. The assertion of De Wette, which has been repeated by Thenius and Bertheau, that the chronicler distorted the true state of the case to favour the Levites, rests upon a misinterpretation of our account, based upon arbitrary assumptions, as I have already shown in my apologetischer Versuch ber die Chronik (p. 361ff.).)<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a><p>In the seventh year of Athaliah's reign, Jehoiada sent for the captains of the king's body-guard to come to him into the temple, and concluded a covenant with them, making them swear and showing them the king's son, namely, to dethrone the tyrant Athaliah and set the king's son upon the throne. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, centuriones, military commanders of the executioners and runners, i.e., of the royal body-guard.
