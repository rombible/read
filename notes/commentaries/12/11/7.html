Jehoash, one of the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound up in one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David, the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed, hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt. Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out.

Having revealed to them the secret of the young king's preservation and entered into a covenant with them for the overthrow of the tyrant, he then arranged with them the plan and time of carrying their plot into execution (see on [336]2Ch 22:10-23:21). The conduct of Jehoiada, who acted the leading and chief part in this conspiracy, admits of an easy and full justification; for, while Athaliah was a usurper, and belonged to a race destined by divine denunciation to destruction, even his own wife had a better and stronger claim to the throne; the sovereignty of Judah had been divinely appropriated to the family of David, and therefore the young prince on whom it was proposed to confer the crown, possessed an inherent right to it, of which a usurper could not deprive him. Moreover, Jehoiada was most probably the high priest, whose official duty it was to watch over the due execution of God's laws, and who in his present movement, was encouraged and aided by the countenance and support of the chief authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, in the country. In addition to all these considerations, he seems to have been directed by an impulse of the Divine Spirit, through the counsels and exhortations of the prophets of the time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">You that go forth on the sabbath, </span> i.e. who having finished their course and week, should have gone home, but were detained, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-8.htm" title="So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.">2 Chronicles 23:8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king; </span> whilst the rest guard the doors and entrances into the temple, these shall have a special care of the king’s person, part on his right, and part on his left hand. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath,.... The course that went out of service at the end of the sabbath; these were not suffered, not any of them, to go into the country, but were detained for the present purpose, and divided into two parts: <p>even they shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king, these were placed in the temple where the king was, or where he should be brought forth, and be a guard on his right and left; this interpretation seems to be agreeably to the order of the text here, and is the sense of Jarchi; but there is this objection to it, that, by such a distribution of both courses, no provision is made for the services of the temple; wherefore Dr. Lightfoot (c) divides them into six parts, each into three, one third of the course that came in for service, the other to keep the watch at the king's house, and the other third at the gate Sur; and the course that went out, one third of them was placed at the gate behind the guard, and the other two to keep the watch of the house for the king's safety; but according to the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4</a>, there were but three ranks or orders of them in all; wherefore the sense of Kimchi, Ben Gersom, and Abarbinel, seems most agreeable, that the first consisted of those that went in on the sabbath, not of all, but half of them, the other half being employed in the service of the sanctuary; and the other two of the course that went out, even all of them, they being entirely at leisure, who were divided into two parts, and disposed of as above. <p>(c) Prospect of the Temple, c. 20. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And two parts of all you that <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.</span><p>(h) Whose charge is ended.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">And two parts of all you that go forth</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">And the two companies of you, even all that go forth</span>. All those men who were going off duty at the palace were to divide themselves into two bodies, and go and serve at the temple to protect the king.

After the death of Ahaziah of Judah, his mother Athaliah, a daughter of Ahab and Jezebel (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>), seized upon the government, by putting to death all the king's descendants with the exception of Joash, a son of Ahaziah of only a year old, who had been secretly carried off from the midst of the royal children, who were put to death, by Jehosheba, his father's sister, the wife of the high priest Jehoiada, and was first of all hidden with his nurse in the bed-chamber, and afterwards kept concealed from Athaliah for six years in the high priest's house. The &#1493; before &#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; is no doubt original, the subject, Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah, being placed at the head absolutely, and a circumstantial clause introduced with &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;: "Athaliah, when she saw that, etc., rose up." &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, all the royal seed, i.e., all the sons and relations of Ahaziah, who could put in any claim to succeed to the throne. At the same time there were hardly any other direct descendants of the royal family in existence beside the sons of Ahaziah, since the elder brothers of Ahaziah had been carried away by the Arabs and put to death, and the rest of the closer blood-relations of the male sex had been slain by Jehu (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm">2 Kings 10:13</a>). - Jehosheba (&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;, in the Chronicles &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;), the wife of the high priest Jehoiada (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>), was a daughter of king Joram and a sister of Ahaziah, but she was most likely not a daughter of Athaliah, as this worshipper of Baal would hardly have allowed her own daughter to marry the high priest, but had been born to Joram by a wife of the second rank. &#1502;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; (Chethb), generally a substantive, mortes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-8.htm">Ezekiel 28:8</a>), here an adjective: slain or set apart for death. The Keri &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; is the participle Hophal, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>. &#1492;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1512; is to be taken in connection with &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;: she stole him (took him away secretly) from the rest of the king's sons, who were about to be put to death, into the chamber of the beds, i.e., not the children's bed-room, but a room in the palace where the beds (mattresses and counterpanes) were kept, for which in the East there is a special room that is not used as a dwelling-room (see Chardin in Harm. Beobb. iii. p. 357). This was the place in which at first it was easiest to conceal the child and its nurse. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "they (Jehosheba and the nurse) concealed him," is not to be altered into &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; after the Chronicles, as Thenius maintains. The masculine is used in the place of the feminine, as is frequently the case. Afterwards he was concealed with her (with Jehosheba) in the house of Jehovah, i.e., in the home of the high-priest in one of the buildings of the court of the temple. </body></html>
