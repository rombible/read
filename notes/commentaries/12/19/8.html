No further communication was held with him. He had outraged all propriety by his appeal to the "men upon the wall" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-27.htm">2 Kings 18:27-35</a>); and it seems to have been thought most dignified to give him no answer at all.

It has been placed at <span class="accented">Tel</span>-<span class="accented">es-Safieh</span>, twelve miles northeast of <span class="accented">Um-Lakis</span>; at <span class="accented">Arak-el-Menshiyeh</span>, about five miles nearly due east of the same; and near <span class="accented">Umm-el-Bikar</span>, four miles south-east of <span class="accented">Um-Lakis</span>. A removal from Um-Lakis to Tel-el-Safieh would mean a retreat. A march from Um-Lakis to either of the other sites would he quite compatible with an intention to push on to Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">For he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</span> Whether Lachish had been taken or not cannot be determined from these words. But we can scarcely suppose that a place of such slight strength can have defied the Assyrian arms successfully.
