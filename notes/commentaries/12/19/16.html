To treat the figurative language of the Old Testament in such a manner does violence to common sense. “Bow thine ear,” “Open thine eyes,” in Hezekiah’s mouth simply meant “Intervene actively between me and my enemy;” although, no doubt, such expressions originally conveyed the actual thoughts of the Israelites about God.<p><span class= "bld">Which hath sent him.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">which he hath sent.</span> The “words” are regarded as a single whole, a <span class= "ital">message.</span><p><span class= "bld">The living God.</span>—In contrast with the lifeless idols of Hamath, Arpad, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/19-16.htm" title="LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God....">2 Kings 19:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Which hath sent him </span>— That is, the messenger who brought this railing letter; or rather Rab-shakeh, who is easily understood to be referred to from the contents of the former chapter, although he would not do him the honour to name him. <span class="ital">Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations, </span>&c. — He acknowledges their triumphs over the gods of the heathen, but distinguishes between them and the God of Israel. <span class="ital">And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods — </span>They were unable to help either themselves or their worshippers, and therefore it is no wonder that the Assyrians have destroyed them. And, in destroying them, though they knew it not, they really served the justice and jealousy of the God of Israel, who has determined to annihilate all the gods of the heathen. But they were deceived in thinking they could therefore be too hard for him, who was so far from being one of the gods whom men’s hands had made, that he himself made all things.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:8-19 Prayer is the never-failing resource of the tempted Christian, whether struggling with outward difficulties or inward foes. At the mercy-seat of his almighty Friend he opens his heart, spreads his case, like Hezekiah, and makes his appeal. When he can discern that the glory of God is engaged on his side, faith gains the victory, and he rejoices that he shall never be moved. The best pleas in prayer are taken from God's honour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which dwellest between the cherubims - The reference is to the shechinah, or miraculous glory, which from time to time appeared above the mercy-seat from between the two cherubims, whose wings overshadowed the ark of the covenant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-27</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, etc.).<p>Thou art the God, even thou alone - This is the protest of the pure theist against the intense polytheism of Sennacherib's letter, which assumes that gods are only gods of particular nations, and that Hezekiah's God is but one out of an indefinite number, no stronger or more formidable than the rest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 19:14-34. Hezekiah's Prayer.<p>14-19. Hezekiah received the letter &#8230; and went up into the house of the Lord&#8212;Hezekiah, after reading it, hastened into the temple, spread it in the childlike confidence of faith before the Lord, as containing taunts deeply affecting the divine honor, and implored deliverance from this proud defier of God and man. The devout spirit of this prayer, the recognition of the Divine Being in the plenitude of His majesty&#8212;so strikingly contrasted with the fancy of the Assyrians as to His merely local power; his acknowledgment of the conquests obtained over other lands; and of the destruction of their wooden idols which, according to the Assyrian practice, were committed to the flames&#8212;because their tutelary deities were no gods; and the object for which he supplicated the divine interposition&#8212;that all the kingdoms of the earth might know that the Lord was the only God&#8212;this was an attitude worthy to be assumed by a pious theocratic king of the chosen people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which hath sent him, </span> i.e. the messenger who brought this railing letter, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.">2 Kings 19:14</a></span>; or Rab-shakeh, who was easily understood out of the former chapter, although he would not do him the honour to name him; or, <span class="ital">sent it</span>, to wit, this letter. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,....

The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">LORD, <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> living God.</span><p>(k) Show by effect that you will not allow your Name to be blasphemed.<p>(l) By this title he discerns God from all idols and false gods.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Lord, bow down thine ear, and hear</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear</span>. This is the translation in Isaiah of the same Hebrew. Both should be alike, and the form chosen by R.V. seems preferable as the words are addressed to God. The king can only speak in the figures which men would use to one another, but in this application of human attributes to the Almighty there need not be of necessity any misconception. There could have been none in Hezekiah’s thoughts concerning the Maker of heaven and earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which hath sent him</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">wherewith he hath sent</span>] <span class="ital">to reproach the living God</span>] There is in the orginal a suffix in the singular number attached to the verb, which refers to the ‘words’ before alluded to though they are mentioned as plural. The idea is however singular, and indicates the ‘message’. So that literally the Hebrew would be translated ‘which he hath sent it’, and that is their way of saying, ‘wherewith he hath sent’. The A.V. took the suffix which in the parallel place of Isaiah is not expressed to refer to Rab-shakeh and so translated ‘which hath sent him’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hezekiah calls Jehovah ‘the living God’ as opposed to the idols of wood and stone spoken of in Sennacherib’s letter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Lord, bow down thine ear, and hear.</span> "Bow down thine ear" is a Hebrew idiom for "give ear," "attend "(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">Psalm 31:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-2.htm">Psalm 71:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-1.htm">Psalm 86:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, etc.).
