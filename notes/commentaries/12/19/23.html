The words contain an admirable description of the boastings of a proud monarch, puffed up with his great success. As if he had said, What place is there into which I cannot make my way?

God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah.

The prophetic message consisted of three different portions:&#8212;First, Sennacherib is apostrophized (2Ki 19:21-28) in a highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid vanity, haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian despot. Secondly, Hezekiah is addressed (2Ki 19:29-31), and a sign is given him of the promised deliverance&#8212;namely, that for two years the presence of the enemy would interrupt the peaceful pursuits of husbandry, but in the third year the people would be in circumstances to till their fields and vineyards and reap the fruits as formerly. Thirdly, the issue of Sennacherib's invasion is announced (2Ki 19:32-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By thy messengers; </span> so thou hast advanced thy very servants above me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I am come up to the height of the mountains; </span> I have brought up my very chariots to those mountains which were thought inaccessible by my army. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lebanon; </span> a high hill, famous for cedars and fir trees, here following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof:</span> this may be understood, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, <i>and</i> the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> lodgings of his borders, <i>and into</i> the forest of his Carmel.</span><p>(p) Meaning Jerusalem, which Isaiah calls the height of his borders, that is, of Judah, Isa 37:24.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">By thy messengers</span>] Rab-shakeh and his companions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">With the multitude of my chariots</span>] This is the translation of the marginal reading (<span class="ital">Keri</span>) which stands as <span class="ital">Kethib</span> in the corresponding verse of Isaiah. Another reading is represented on the margin of the R.V. thus ‘with the driving of my chariots’. This stands in the Hebrew text in Kings, and by some is preferred as being more unusual and therefore perhaps better suited to a poetical passage like the present. But the form in Isaiah has the support of all the versions and so had better be adopted here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>to <span class="ital">the sides</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">innermost parts</span>] <span class="ital">of Lebanon</span>] The word which A.V. translates ‘sides’ is very frequently applied to the interior, as of a house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-10.htm" title="And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say to him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with you? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold your tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.">Amos 6:10</a>), or a ship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-5.htm" title="Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.">Jonah 1:5</a>), or a cave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm" title="And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good to you.

And so here it indicates the interior recesses of Lebanon, whither as conqueror Sennacherib expects to penetrate. The Lebanon was one of the choicest parts of the Holy Land, and its beauty is extolled in several passages of Solomon’s song (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm" title="For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelled in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.">1 Kings 9:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and will</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">I will</span>] <span class="ital">cut down the tall cedar trees</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">cedars</span>] <span class="ital">thereof</span>] Both the changes are to the form in Isaiah. The beauty of the Lebanon was in its glorious trees. The figure chosen therefore expresses the devastation which the Assyrian purposed to bring on the grandest features of the country.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the lodgings of his borders</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">his farthest lodging-places</span>. The words express the intention of the Assyrian to leave no place in the whole land of Judah unravaged, however remote it might be. There is a various reading in Isaiah, which is rendered ‘the height of his border’. The LXX. does not represent this clause.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and into <span class="ital">the forest of his Carmel</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the forest of his fruitful field</span>. R.V. also omits the italics. Carmel though often used as a proper name to designate that beautiful and fertile promontory which stretches out to the Mediterranean on the border of the tribe of Asher, yet as a common noun signifies a fruitful garden-like field. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm" title="And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.">Jeremiah 2:7</a>, ‘I brought you into a plentiful country’ (<span class="ital">lit.</span> a country of garden-land, Heb. <span class="ital">Carmel</span>).

But he had <span class="accented">thought</span> it; and God accounts men's deliberate thoughts as their utterances. Isaiah's "oracle" brings out and places in a striking light the pride, self-confidence, and self-sufficiency which underlay Sennacherib's messages and letters. <span class="cmt_word">With the multitude of my chariots</span>; or, <span class="accented">with chariots upon chariots</span>. The chariot-force was the main arm of the Assyrian military service - that on which most dependence was placed, and to which victory was commonly attributed. The number of chariots that could be brought into the field by the Assyrians is nowhere stated; but we find nearly four thousand hostile chariots collected to oppose an ordinary Assyrian invasion, and defeated (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 362, note 8). The estimates of Cterias - eleven thousand for Ninas, and a hundred thousand for Semiramis (Died. Sic., 2:5. &sect; 4) - are, of course, unhistorical. <span class="cmt_word">I am come up to the height of the mountains.</span> "The height of the mountains" is here the high ground which an army would have to traverse in passing from the Coele-Syrian valley into Palestine. It is not exactly Lebanon, which runs parallel with the coast, and certainly does not "guard Palestine to the north," as Keil supposes; But it may be viewed as a "side" or "flank" of Lebanon. In point of fact, Lebanon and Hermon unite their roots to form a barrier between the Coele-Syrian plain (<span class="accented">El Buka'a</span>) and the valley of the Jordan, and an invader from the north must cross this barrier. It is not so difficult or rugged but that the Assyrians could bring their chariots ever it. They were accustomed to traverse far more difficult regions in Zagros and Niphatos and Taurus, and to carry their chariots with them, dismounting when necessary, and having the vehicles lifted over obstacles by human hands (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74). <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon.</span> An army which invades Palestine by the Coele-Syrian valley - quite the easiest and most usual line of invasion - necessarily passes along the entire eastern "side," or "flank," of Lebanon, which is the proper meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and not "loftiest height" (Keil), or "innermost recess" (Revised Version). The plural, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, is natural when a mountain range, like Lebanon, is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">And will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof.</span> The felling of timber in the Syrian mountain-chains was a common practice of the Assyrian invaders, and had two quite distinct objects. Sometimes it was mere cruel devastation, done to injure and impoverish the inhabitants; but more often it was done for the sake of the timber which the conqueror carried off into his own country. "The mountains of Amanus I ascended," says Asshur-nazir-pal; "wood for bridges, pines, box, cypress, I cut down... cedar-wood from Amanus I destined for Bit-Hira and my pleasure-house called Azmaku, and for the temple of the moon and sun, the exalted gods. I proceeded to the land of Iz-mehri, and took possession of it throughout: I cut down beams for bridges, and carried them to Nineveh" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 74). The cedar (<span class="accented">erez</span>) and the pine, or juniper (<span class="accented">berosh</span>), were in special request. <span class="cmt_word">And I will enter into the lodgings of his borders -</span> rather, the <span class="accented">lodge of its</span> border - perhaps a palace or hunting-lodge on the outskirt of the Lebanon forest region (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and into the forest of his Carmel</span>; rather, the <span class="accented">forest of its orchard</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the choicest part of the Lebanon forest region - the part which is rather park or orchard than mere forest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the challenge, to observe the blasphemies of Sennacherib, Hezekiah mentions the fact that the Assyrians have really devastated all lands, and therefore that it is not without ground that they boast of their mighty power; but he finds the explanation of this in the impotence and nothingness of the gods of the heathen. &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;, truly, indeed - the kings of Asshur have devastated the nations and their land. Instead of this we find in Isaiah: "they have devastated all lands and their (own) land" - which is evidently the more difficult and also the more original reading, and has been altered in our account, because the thought that the Assyrians had devastated their own land by making war upon other lands, that is to say, had depopulated it and thereby laid it waste, was not easy to understand. "And have cast their gods into the fire, for they are not gods, but works of human hands, wood and stone, and have thus destroyed them." Hezekiah does not mention this as a sign of the recklessness of the Assyrians (Knobel), but, because Sennacherib had boasted that the gods of no nation had been able to resist him (vv. 12, 13), to put this fact in the right light, and attach thereto the prayer that Jehovah, by granting deliverance, would make known to all the kingdoms of the earth that He alone was God. Instead of &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; we have in Isaiah &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503;, the inf. absol.; in this connection the more difficult and more genuine reading. This also applies to the omission of &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-19.htm">2 Kings 19:19</a>) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-20.htm">Isaiah 37:20</a>, since the use of Jehovah as a predicate, "that Thou alone art Jehovah," is very rare, and has therefore been misunderstood even by Gesenius. By the introduction of Elohim, the thought "that Thou Jehovah art God alone" is simplified. </body></html>
