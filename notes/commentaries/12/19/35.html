SENNACHERIB’S RETREAT, AND HIS “VIOLENT END.</span><p>(35) <span class= "bld">And it came to pass </span>(in)<span class= "bld"> that night.</span>—This definition of time is wanting in the parallel text; but it is implied by the phrase in the morning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">Isaiah 37:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">2Kings 19:35</a>). The night intended can hardly be the one which followed the day when the prophecy was spoken (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.">2Kings 19:29</a>). The expression “in that night,” may perhaps be compared with the prophetic “in that day,” and understood to. mean simply “in that memorable night which was the occasion of this catastrophe.” (Theuius sees in this clause an indication that the present section was derived from another source, probably from the one used by the chronicler in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/32-20.htm" title="And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.">2Chronicles 32:20-23</a>. Reuss thinks this confirmed by the fact that neither the prediction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-7.htm" title="Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.">2Kings 19:7</a>, nor that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/19-21.htm" title="This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.">2Kings 19:21-34</a>, speaks of so great and so immediate an overthrow.)<p><span class= "bld">The angel of the Lord went out.</span>—The destroying angel, who smote the firstborn of the Egyptians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/12-12.htm" title="For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.">Exodus 12:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>), and smote Israel after David’s census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/24-15.htm" title="So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.">2Samuel 24:15-17</a>). These passages undoubtedly favour the view that the Assyrian army was devastated by pestilence, as Josephus asserts. Others have suggested the agency of a simoom, a storm with lightning, an earthquake, &c. In any case a supernatural causation is involved not only in the immense number slain, and that in one night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-6.htm" title="Nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness; nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.">Psalm 91:6</a>), but in the coincidence of the event with the predictions of Isaiah, and with the crisis in the history of the true religion:<p>“Vuolsi così colà dove si puote<p>Ciò che si vuole; e più non dimandare.”<p><span class= "bld">In the camp of the Assyrians.</span>—Where this was is not said.

The disaster did not break the power of the great king, who continued to reign for twenty years, and waged many other victorious wars. But none the less it must have been a very grave blow, the effects of which were felt throughout the empire, and permanently modified the imperial policy; for in the following year Chaldæa was again in revolt, and to the end of his reign Sennacherib never renewed his attack upon Judah” (<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">And when they arose early.</span>—The few who were spared found, not sick and dying, but corpses, all around them.

The night which immediately followed the sending of this message to Hezekiah, was the main body of the besieging army slain. Hezekiah had not force sufficient to sally out upon them, and attack their camp, nor would God destroy them by sword or bow; but he sent a destroying angel, in the dead of night, to make an assault upon them, which their sentinels, though ever so watchful, could neither discover nor resist: such an angel as slew the firstborn of Egypt. Josephus says, the angel slew them by inflicting a pestilential disease which caused death immediately. “But his authority,” says Vitringa, “in matters of this kind, is of no great weight. It is my opinion,” continues he, “that in a dreadful storm, raised by this destroying angel, these men were killed by lightning; their bodies being burned within, while their outward garments were untouched.” The number slain was prodigious, and Rab-shakeh, probably, among them. <span class="ital">And when they rose early in the morning — </span>Namely, the few that were left alive; <span class="ital">behold, they were all dead corpses — </span>Scarce a living man of their companions and fellow- soldiers remained. How great in power and might must the holy angels be, when one angel, in one night, could make so great a slaughter! And how weak are the mightiest men before the almighty God!

Those whose children are undutiful, ought to consider whether they have not been so to their Father in heaven? This history exhibits a strong proof of the good of firm trust and confidence in God. He will afflict, but not forsake his people. It is well when our troubles drive us to our knees. But does it not reprove our unbelief? How unwilling are we to rest on the declaration of Jehovah! How desirous to know in what way he will save us! How impatient when relief is delayed! But we must wait for the fulfilling of his word.

They imply that there was no disturbance during the night, no alarm, no knowledge on the part of the living that their comrades were dying all around them by thousands. All mere natural causes must be rejected, and God must be regarded as having slain the men in their sleep without causing disturbance, either by pestilence or by that "visitation" of which English law speaks. The most nearly parallel case is the destruction of the first-born, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>.<p>The Egyptian version of this event recorded in Herodotus is that, during the night, silently and secretly, an innumerable multitude of field-mice spread themselves through the Assyrian host, and gnawed their quivers, bows, and shield-straps, so as to render them useless. When morning broke, the Assyrians fled hastily, and the Egyptians pursuing put a vast number to the sword. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 19:35, 36.

As to the secondary agent employed in the destruction of the Assyrian army, it is most probable that it was effected by a hot south wind, the simoon, such as to this day often envelops and destroys whole caravans. This conjecture is supported by 2Ki 19:7 and Jer 51:1. The destruction was during the night; the officers and soldiers, being in full security, were negligent; their discipline was relaxed; the camp guards were not alert, or perhaps they themselves were the first taken off, and those who slept, not wrapped up, imbibed the poison plentifully. If this had been an evening of dissolute mirth (no uncommon thing in a camp), their joy (perhaps for a victory), or "the first night of their attacking the city," says Josephus, became, by its effects, one means of their destruction [Calmet, Fragments].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That night; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The sequel is told in a few words. That night destruction came down on the host of Sennacherib, as it lay en-camped at some distance from Jerusalem, silently and swiftly. Without noise, without disturbance, the sleeping men slept the sleep of death, and in the morning, when the survivors awoke, it was found that a hundred and eighty-five thousand were slain. Upon this, with the remnant of his army, Sennacherib hastily returned to Nineveh. There, some time after - about seventeen years according to our reckoning  - a conspiracy was formed against him by two of his sons, who murdered him as he was worshipping in a temple, and fled into Armenia. Another son, Esarhaddon, succeeded. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass that night.</span> The important expression, "that night," is omitted from the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>, but is undoubtedly an original portion of the present history. It can have no other meaning - as Keil and Bahr have seen - than "the night following the day on which Isaiah had foretold to Hezekiah the deliverance of Jerusalem." God's word "runneth very swiftly." No sooner was the premise given than the destroying angel received his orders, and "that night" the terrible stroke fell. <span class="cmt_word">That the angel of the Lord went out</span>; or, <span class="accented">an angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, LXX.). We cannot say, with Bahr, that it was "the same one who smote the firstborn in Egypt, and inflicted the pestilence after the census under David." Revelation does not tell us that there is definitely one destroying angel. "The angel of death" is a rabbinical invention. It accords rather with the analogy of God's dealings that he should use at one time the services of one minister, at another time those of another. <span class="cmt_word">And smote.</span> Imagination has been over-busy in conjecturing the exact manner of the smiting. Some critics have suggested pestilence, or more definitely "the plague" (Gesenius, Dathe, Maurer, Ewald, Winer, Thenins, Keil, etc.); others a terrible storm (Vitringa, Stanley); others the simoom (Prideaux, Milman); others a nocturnal attack by Tirhakah (Ussher, Preiss, Michaelis). Some of these the text altogether precludes, as the attack of Tirhakah, which must have aroused the whole host, and not left the disaster to be discovered by those who "awoke early in the morning." Others are improbable, as the simoom, or a terrible storm with thunder and lightning, which have never been known to accomplish such a destruction. Pestilence is no doubt possible, but a pestilence of a strange and miraculous character, to which men succumbed without awaking or disturbing others. But the narrative rather points to sudden and silent death during sleep, such as often happens to men in the course of nature singly, and here on this occasion was made to happen in one night to a hundred and eighty-five thousand men by the Divine omnipotence acting abnormally. <span class="cmt_word">In the camp of the Assyrians.</span> The destruction was not only at one time, but in one place. "The camp of the Assyrians" cannot mean half a dozen camps situated in half a dozen different places, as Keil supposes. Sennacherib was somewhere with his main army, encamped for the night, and there, wherever it was, the blow fell. But the exact locality is uncertain. All that the narrative makes clear is that it was not in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. Herodotus places the catastrophe at Pelusium (2. 141). Bahr thinks it was probably before Libnah. I should incline to place it between Libnah and the Egyptian frontier, Sennacherib, when he heard that Tirhakah was coming against him (ver. 9), having naturally marched forward to meet and engage his army. <span class="cmt_word">A hundred four score and five thousand.</span> These figures do not pretend to exactness, and can scarcely have been more than a rough estimate. They are probably the Assyrians' own estimate of their loss, which the Jews would learn from such of the fugitives as fell into their hands. <span class="cmt_word">And when they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the survivors - <span class="cmt_word">arose early in the morning, they</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hundred and eighty-five thousand  - <span class="cmt_word">were all dead corpses</span> - absolutely dead, that is; not merely sick or dying. The fact makes against the theory of a pestilence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To confirm what he had said, the prophet gave to Hezekiah a sign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a>.): "Eat this year what groweth in the fallow, and in the second year what groweth wild, and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof." That the words are not addressed to the king of Assyria as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>, but to Hezekiah, is evident from their contents. This sudden change in the person addressed may be explained from the fact that from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29</a> the words contain a perfectly fresh train of thought. For &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1494;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-34.htm">1 Samuel 2:34</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-10.htm">1 Samuel 14:10</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-29.htm">Jeremiah 44:29</a>. In all these passages &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, is not a (supernatural) wonder, a &#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-3.htm">1 Kings 13:3</a>, but consists simply in the prediction of natural events, which serve as credentials to a prediction, whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-7.htm">Isaiah 38:7</a> a miracle is given as an &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;. The inf. abs. &#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500; is not used for the pret. (Ges., Then., and others), but for the imperf. or fut.: "one will eat." &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, the (present) year. &#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#1495; signifies the corn which springs up and grows from the grains that have been shaken out the previous year (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-11.htm">Leviticus 25:11</a>). &#1505;&#1495;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (in Isa. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1505;) is explained by Abulw. as signifying the corn which springs up again from the roots of what has been sown. The etymology of the word is uncertain, so that it is impossible to decide which of the two forms is the original one. For the fact itself compare the evidence adduced in the Comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-7.htm">Leviticus 25:7</a>, that in Palestine and other lands two or three harvests can be reaped from one sowing. - The signs mentioned do not enable us to determine with certainty how long the Assyrians were in the land. All that can be clearly gathered from the words, "in this and the following year will they live upon that which has sprung up without any sowing," is that for two years, i.e., in two successive autumns, the fields could not be cultivated because the enemy had occupied the land and laid it waste. But whether the occupation lasted two years, or only a year and a little over, depends upon the time of the year at which the Assyrians entered the land. If the invasion of Judah took place in autumn, shortly before the time for sowing, and the miraculous destruction of the Assyrian forces occurred a year after about the same time, the sowing of two successive years would be prevented, and the population of Judah would be compelled to live for two years upon what had sprung up without sowing. Consequently both the prophecy of Isaiah and the fulfilment recorded in vv. 35, 36 would fall in the autumn, when the Assyrians had ruled for a whole year in the land; so that the prophet was able to say: in this year and in the second (i.e., the next) will they eat after-growth and wild growth; inasmuch as when he said this, the first year had not quite expired. Even if the overthrow of the Assyrians took place immediately afterwards (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>), with the extent to which they had carried out the desolation of the land, many of the inhabitants having been slain or taken prisoners, and many others having been put to flight, it would be utterly impossible in the same year to cultivate the fields and sow them, and the people would be obliged to live in the second or following year upon what had grown wild, until the harvest of the second year, when the land could be properly cultivated, or rather till the third year, when it could be reaped again.<p>(Note: There is no necessity, therefore, to explain the sign here given, either by the assumption of a sabbatical year, with or without a year of jubilee following, or by supposing that the Assyrians did not depart immediately after the catastrophe described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>, but remained till after they had attempted an expedition into Egypt, or indeed by any other artificial hypothesis.)</body></html>
