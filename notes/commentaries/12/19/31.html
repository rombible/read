God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory.

Then Isaiah &#8230; sent&#8212;A revelation having been made to Isaiah, the prophet announced to the king that his prayer was heard. The prophetic message consisted of three different portions:&#8212;First, Sennacherib is apostrophized (2Ki 19:21-28) in a highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid vanity, haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian despot. Secondly, Hezekiah is addressed (2Ki 19:29-31), and a sign is given him of the promised deliverance&#8212;namely, that for two years the presence of the enemy would interrupt the peaceful pursuits of husbandry, but in the third year the people would be in circumstances to till their fields and vineyards and reap the fruits as formerly. Thirdly, the issue of Sennacherib's invasion is announced (2Ki 19:32-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A remnant; </span> that handful of Jews who now were gathered together, and shut up in Jerusalem, shall go out to their several habitations, and by my singular blessing increase exceedingly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They that escape out of Mount Zion; </span> the same thing expressed in other words, which is usual in the Hebrew language. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this:</span> although when you reflect upon yourselves, and consider either your present fewness and weakness, or your great unworthiness, this may seem too great a blessing for you to expect or believe; yet God will do it from the zeal which he hath, both for his own name, to vindicate it from the blasphemous reproaches of the Assyrians, and for the good of his undeserving people. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,....

The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> zeal of the LORD <i>of hosts</i> shall do this.</span><p>(x) The love, that God has for his Church will overcome the counsels and enterprises of men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">And they that escape out of mount Zion</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">And out of mount Zion they that shall escape</span>.

Long ago have I done this, from the days of olden time have I formed it! Now have I brought it to pass, that fortified cities should be to be destroyed into waste heaps." <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-26.htm">2 Kings 19:26</a>. "And their inhabitants, short of hand, were dismayed and put to shame; they were herb of the field and green of the turf, grass of the roofs and blighted corn before the stalk." <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-27.htm">2 Kings 19:27</a>. "And thy sitting and thy going out and thy coming I know, and thy raging against me." <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>. "Because of thy raging against me and thy safety, which rise up into my ears, I put my ring into thy nose, and my bridle into thy lips, and bring thee back by the way by which thou hast come." The words are still addressed to the Assyrian, of whom the Lord inquires whether he does not know that the destructive deeds performed by him had been determined very long before. "Hast thou not heart?" namely, what follows, what the Lord had long ago made known through His prophets in Judah (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-7.htm">Isaiah 7:7-9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-4</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>, etc.). &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511;, from distant time have I done it, etc., refers to the divine ordering and governing of the events of the universe, which God has purposed and established from the very beginning of time. The pronoun &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, and the suffixes attached to &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;, do not refer with vague generality to the substance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm">2 Kings 19:24</a>, i.e., to the boastings of the Assyrians quoted there (Drechsler), but to &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;, i.e., to the conquests and devastations which the Assyrian had really effected. The &#1493; before &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; introduces the apodosis, as is frequently the case after a preceding definition of time (cf. Ges. 155, a). &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;&#1497;, "that it may be to destroy" (&#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, a contraction of &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, Keri and Isaiah, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;; see Ewald, 73, c., and 245, b.), i.e., that it shall be destroyed, - according to a turn which is very common in Isaiah, like &#1500;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, it is to burn  equals  it shall be burned (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-15.htm">Isaiah 44:15</a>, and Ewald, 237, c.). The rendering given by Ges., Knob., Then., and others, "that thou mayest be for destruction," is at variance with this usage.</body></html>
