God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory.

Then Isaiah &#8230; sent&#8212;A revelation having been made to Isaiah, the prophet announced to the king that his prayer was heard. The prophetic message consisted of three different portions:&#8212;First, Sennacherib is apostrophized (2Ki 19:21-28) in a highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid vanity, haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian despot. Secondly, Hezekiah is addressed (2Ki 19:29-31), and a sign is given him of the promised deliverance&#8212;namely, that for two years the presence of the enemy would interrupt the peaceful pursuits of husbandry, but in the third year the people would be in circumstances to till their fields and vineyards and reap the fruits as formerly. Thirdly, the issue of Sennacherib's invasion is announced (2Ki 19:32-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Therefore; </span> because I had armed thee with my commission and strength, and taken away their spirit and courage, and withdrew my help from them to give it to thee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their inhabitants; </span> the people of Israel, and Judah, and other places which thou hast conquered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As the grass of the field; </span> which is weak and quickly fading, and unable to resist any hand or instrument which offers violence to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As corn blasted before it be grown up, </span> i.e. all their designs and hopes were disappointed before they could come to any perfection or success. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,....

The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore their <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were <i>as</i> the grass of the field, and <i>as</i> the green herb, <i>as</i> the grass on the housetops, and <i>as corn</i> blasted before it be grown up.</span><p>(r) Thus he describes the wicked, who flourish for a time, and later fade and decay like flowers.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">Therefore</span>] i.e. Not, as thou thinkest, because of thy might, but because I sent thee; for this reason it is that the people against whom thou camest were dismayed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of small power</span>] Literally, as in the margin ‘short of hand’.

When God has decreed a change in the distribution of power among the nations, his providence works doubly. It infuses confidence and strength into the aggressive people, and spreads dismay and terror among those who are attacked. Unaccountable panics seize them - they seem paralyzed; instead of making every possible preparation for resistance, they fold their hands and do nothing. They are like fascinated birds before the stealthy advance of the serpent. <span class="cmt_word">They were dismayed and confounded.</span> Historically, the prophet declares, this was the cause of the general collapse of the nations whom the Assyrians attacked. God put a craven fear into their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house-tops.</span> The "grass of the field" is one of the most frequent similes for weakness. "All flesh is grass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>); "They shall soon be cut down like the grass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>); "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>); "I am withered like grass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>). In the hot sun of an Eastern sky nothing faded more quickly. But this weakness was intensified in the "grass of the house-tops." It "withered before it grew up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>). The depth of earth was so slight, the exposure so great, the heat so scorching, that it sank in death almost as soon as it had sprung to life. Such has been the weakness of the nations given over as a prey to the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_word">And as corn blasted before it be grown up.</span> Corn blasted before it shoots into a stalk is as frail as grass, or frailer. It dwindles and disappears without even asserting itself. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The divine promise. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-21.htm">2 Kings 19:21</a>. When Hezekiah had prayed, the prophet Isaiah received a divine revelation with regard to the hearing of this prayer, which he sent, i.e., caused to be handed over, to the king. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-21.htm">2 Kings 19:21</a>) is omitted in Isaiah, so that &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is to be taken in the sense of "with regard to that which thou hast prayed to me," whilst &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (I have heard) elucidates the thought and simplifies the construction. The word of the Lord announced to the king, (1) the shameful retreat of Sennacherib as a just retribution for his mockery of the living God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-21.htm">2 Kings 19:21-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22-29</a>); (2) the confirmation of this assurance through the indication of a sign by which Hezekiah was to recognise the deliverance of Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm">2 Kings 19:29-31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30-32</a>), and through the distinct promise, that the Assyrian would neither come into the city nor besiege it, because the Lord was sheltering it (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33-35</a>).
