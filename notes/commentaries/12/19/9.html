Sennacherib does not <span class= "ital">name</span> Tirhakah, but calls him “the king of Meluhhu,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Meroë. The two successors of Sennacherib had further wars with Tirhakah. Esarhaddon, according to notices in the annals of Assurbanipal, conquered Tirhakah, “king of Mizraim and Cush, and divided Egypt between a number of vassal kings. A list of twenty names is preserved, beginning with” Necho king of Memphis and Sais.” This was Esarhaddon’s tenth expedition (circ. 671 B.C. ). Tirhakah, however, invaded Egypt once more, for “he despised the might of Asshur, Istar, and the great gods my lords, and trusted to his own power.” This led to Assurbanipal’s first expedition, which was directed against Egypt. Ewald and Knobel suppose that Isaiah 18 refers to an embassy from Tirhakah asking the co-operation of Judah against the common foe. If it be alleged that Shabataka was still nominal king of Egypt, we may regard Tirhakah as commanding in his father’s name. But Egyptian chronology is too uncertain to be allowed much weight in the question.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm" title="And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,">2 Kings 19:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">He heard say of Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, </span>&c. — Probably of Ethiopia beyond Egypt.

He was the last king of the 25th or Ethiopian dynasty, which commenced with Shebek or Sabaco, and he reigned upward of 26 years. The Assyrian inscriptions show that he still ruled in Egypt as late as 667 B.C., when Esarhaddon <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a> died, and his son Asshur-bani-pal succeeded him. He probably ascended the Egyptian throne about 692 B.C., having previously ruled over Ethiopia before he became king of Egypt (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-9.htm">Isaiah 37:9</a>). Thus he was probably reigning in Ethiopia at the time of Sennacherib's expedition, while Sethos and perhaps other secondary monarchs bore rule over Egypt. His movements caused Sennacherib to send a second embassy, instead of marching in person against the Jewish king. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-13. when he heard say of Tirhakah &#8230;, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee, &c.&#8212;This was the "rumor" to which Isaiah referred [2Ki 19:7]. Tirhakah reigned in Upper Egypt, while So (or Sabaco) ruled in Lower Egypt. He was a powerful monarch, another Sesostris, and both he and Sabaco have left many monuments of their greatness. The name and figure of Tirhakah receiving war captives, are still seen in the Egyptian temple of Medinet Abou. This was the expected succor which was sneered at by Rab-shakeh as "a bruised reed" (2Ki 18:21). Rage against Hezekiah for allying himself with Egypt, or the hope of being better able to meet this attack from the south, induced him, after hearing the rumor of Tirhakah's advance, to send a menacing letter to Hezekiah, in order that he might force the king of Judah to an immediate surrender of his capital. This letter, couched in the same vaunting and imperious style as the speech of Rab-shakeh, exceeded it in blasphemy, and contained a larger enumeration of conquered places, with the view of terrifying Hezekiah and showing him the utter hopelessness of all attempts at resistance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">King of Ethiopia, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">of Cush</span>, i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Nor was there any need that he should force his passage through Egypt, which is objected against this opinion by a very learned man; because the Egyptians (against whom this Sennacherib warred, as heathen historians, Herodotus and Berosus, relate) and the Ethiopians were confederates in this expedition, as Josephus expressly affirms; who lived above 1600 years nearer the time when this was done than we, and therefore was more likely to understand it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,....

The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,</span><p>(e) That is, Sennacherib.<p>(f) For the kings of Ethiopia and Egypt joined together against the king of Assyria because of his oppression of other countries.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">And when he heard say of Tirhakah</span>] Tirhakah is called by Manetho, <span class="ital">Tarakos</span>. He was the third and last king of the 25th dynasty, which was Ethiopian. The duration of his reign is not accurately known. The news of Tirhakah’s advance caused Sennacherib to feel the importance of getting Jerusalem into his possession, seeing it was so much stronger than any position which he yet had. It had been a fortress of considerable importance in the time of the Jebusites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm" title="And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.">2 Samuel 5:6</a>), and in the intervening period between David and Hezekiah its defences had been made much more complete.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah</span>] This time they were the bearers of a letter (see below, verse 14) to the king. This may be the letter alluded to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-17.htm" title="He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.">2 Chronicles 32:17</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> <span class="accented">- Sennacherib's letter to Hezekiah</span>. Sennacherib seems to have been induced to write to Hezekiah by the fact that he could not march against him at once. A forward movement on the part of Tirhakah was reported to him (ver. 9), and he thought it necessary to meet, or at least watch it. But he must vent his anger on the rebel Judaean monarch in some way. He sends a letter, therefore, as more weighty and impressive than a mere message. He warns Hezekiah against being himself deceived by Jehovah (ver. 10); and he expands his inductive argument in proof of the irresistible might of Assyria, by an enumeration of four more recent conquests (ver. 12). Otherwise, he does little but repeat what Rabshakeh had already urged. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he heard say of Tirhakah King of Ethiopia.</span> Tirhakah was one of the most distinguished of the later Egyptian monarchs. An Ethiopian by birth, and originally ruling from Napata over the Upper Nile valley from the First Cataract to (perhaps) Khartoum, he extended his dominion over Egypt probably about  <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>, maintaining, however, Shabatok, as a sort of puppet-king, upon the throne. About  <span class="date">B.C. 693</span> he succeeded Shabatok, and held the throne till  <span class="date">B.C. 667</span>, being engaged in many wars with the Assyrians. The native form of his name is "Tahrak" or "Tahark," the Assyrian "Tarku" or "Tarqu," the Greek "Taracos" or "Tearchon." He has left numerous memorials in Egypt and Ethiopia, and was regarded by the Greeks as a great conqueror. At the time of Sennacherib's second attack on Hezekiah (about  <span class="date">B.C. 699</span>) he was, as appears in the text, not yet King of Egypt, but only of Ethiopia. Still, he regarded Egypt as practically under his suzerainty, and when it was threatened by Sennacherib's approach, he marched to the rescue. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, he is come out to fight against thee.</span> He may have regarded himself as bound in honor to come to the relief of Hezekiah, or he may have been simply bent on defending his own territory. He sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying, <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"A day of distress, and of chastisement, and of rejection is this day." &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1492;: the divine chastisement. &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1492;: contemptuous treatment, or rejection of the people on the part of God (compare &#1504;&#1488;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>).
