Of Nisroch we have no information except this passage, and it is uncertain whether the name be rightly represented in the Hebrew. Some have connected the word with the Hebrew <span class="ital">nesher</span> = an eagle, and because on the Assyrian monuments one most conspicuous figure is an eagle-headed man have thought that the name given to the god by the Hebrews refers to this representation. Probably the name is incorrect either because the Jews did not learn it correctly, or connected it with a false etymology. Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> x. 1, 5) says Sennacherib was murdered ‘in his own temple Arasce’ (<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ναῷ Ἀράσκῃ</span>), which looks as if he had had some different name before him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Adrammclech and Sharezer</span> his sons] Just as in verse 31 the Massoretic text had an omission of consonants and gave only the vowels of the word, so it is done with ‘his sons’ here. The consonants as well as vowels are written in the parallel place in Isaiah. The Chronicler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-21.htm" title="And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.">2 Chronicles 32:21</a>) says ‘they that came forth of his own bowels slew him with the sword’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>into <span class="ital">the land of Armenia</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Ararat</span>. The change is in accordance with the Hebrew text. But the interpretation of Ararat as Armenia is found in the Vulgate of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-4.htm" title="And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.">Genesis 8:4</a>, where ‘upon the mountains of Ararat’ is represented by <span class="ital">super montes Armeniœ</span>. Then in the verse of Isaiah parallel to this of 2 Kings, the LXX. translates by <span class="greekheb">εἰς Ἀρμενίαν</span>, and the Vulgate by <span class="ital">in terram Armeniorum</span>. That <span class="ital">Ararat</span>, though unknown to the Greeks and Romans, was the name of a part of Armenia is made evident by the name <span class="ital">Araratia</span> being given by Moses of Khorene to the central province of that country (<span class="ital">Hist. Armen</span>. Whiston, p. 361). In <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/1-21.htm" title="And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; who appointed over his father's accounts, and over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael's son.">Tob 1:21</a> where we have a notice of this king Sennacherib and his death, the name of the land of refuge is given as <span class="ital">Ararath</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Esarhaddon</span>] According to the Assyrian canon this king came to the throne in b.c. 681, and reigned till 668. In consequence of disaffection in Babylonia, he united it to the Assyrian kingdom and was the first (and only) Assyrian who had two capital cities. For he resided now in Nineveh and now in Babylon. On his dwelling at Babylon, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm" title="Why the LORD brought on them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>. Esarhaddon was famous for the number and grandeur of his buildings, having erected in Mesopotamia and Assyria no fewer than thirty temples. His palace at Nimrûd has been discovered and excavated in recent times.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> - seventeen or eighteen years afterwards; not "fifty-five days" after, as the author of Tobit (1. 21) says - <span class="cmt_word">as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god.</span> The word Nisroch offers considerable difficulty. It has been connected with <span class="accented">nesher</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>), "eagle," and explained as a reference to the eagle-headed genius sometimes seen in the Assyrian sculptures ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 265). But there is no evidence that the genii were ever worshipped in Assyria, much less that they had temples of their own, nor is any name resembling "Nisroch" attached to any of them. The word itself is somewhat doubtful, and different manuscripts of the Septuagint, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>, have the variants of <span class="accented">Nasaraeh</span>, <span class="accented">Esorach</span>, <span class="accented">Meserach</span>, and <span class="accented">Asarach</span>, while Josephus has <span class="accented">Araskas</span>. Asarach might conceivably be a strengthened form of Asshur; but the substitution of <span class="accented">samech</span> for <span class="accented">shin</span> is against this explanation. Still, Asshur was certainly Sennacherib's favorite god, the deity whom he principally worshipped. Josephus regards the name as belonging, not to the god, but to the temple (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), which is perhaps the true solution of the difficulty. Translate - "as he was worshipping his god in the house Nisroch." <span class="cmt_word">That Adram-melech and Sharezer his sons.</span> Adram-melech is called "Adrammeles" by Aby-denus, "Ardamazanes" by Polyhistor. Neither form resembles any known Assyrian name, but <span class="accented">Adrammelech has a good</span> Semitic derivation (see the comment on 2 Kings 18:31). "Sharezer" is probably a shortened form of Nergal-shar-ozer (comp. "Shalman," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), which was a name in use at the time ('Eponym Canon,' p. 68). Abydenus seems to have called him Nergilus. <span class="cmt_word">Smote him with the sword.</span> So Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:1. &sect; 5) and Mos. Chor. ('Hist. Armen.,' 1:22). A mutilated inscription of Esarhaddon's seems to have described his war with his brothers ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 103) at the commencement of his reign, but the earlier part is wanting. <span class="cmt_word">And they escaped into the land of Armenia</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of Ararat</span>. The Hebrew "Ararat" is the Assyrian "Ur-arda" - the ordinary name for the country about Lakes Van and Urumiyeh. The name "Armenia" is not found earlier than the inscriptions of Darius Hystaspis. <span class="cmt_word">And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</span> Esarhaddon (the <span class="accented">Sarchedon</span> of Tobit 1:21, and the Asshur-akh-iddin of the Assyrian inscriptions) succeeded his father in  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>, and was engaged for some time in a war with his brothers on the Upper Euphrates, after which he made himself master of Nineveh. He reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 669</span>, when he was succeeded by his son, Asshur-bani-pal. Assyria reached the acme of her prosperity in his time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sign is followed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-30.htm">2 Kings 19:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-31.htm">2 Kings 19:31</a> by the distinct promise of the deliverance of Judah and Jerusalem, for which Isaiah uses the sign itself as a type. "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again strike roots downwards and bear fruit upwards; for from Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and that which is escaped from Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah will do this." &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1505;&#1507;, to add roots, i.e., to strike fresh roots. The meaning is, that Judah will not succumb to this judgment. The remnant of the nation that has escaped from destruction by the Assyrians will once more grow and flourish vigorously; for from Jerusalem will a rescued remnant go forth. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; denotes those who have escaped destruction by the judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.). The deliverance was attached to Jerusalem or to Mount Zion, not so much because the power of the Assyrians was to be destroyed before the gates of Jerusalem, as because of the greater importance which Jerusalem and Mount Zion, as the centre of the kingdom of God, the seat of the God-King, possessed in relation to the covenant-nation, so that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, it was thence that the Messianic salvation was also to proceed. This deliverance is traced to the zeal of the Lord on behalf of His people and against His foes (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), like the coming of the Messiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> to establish an everlasting kingdom of peace and righteousness. The deliverance of Judah out of the power of Asshur was a prelude and type of the deliverance of the people of God by the Messiah out of the power of all that was ungodly. The &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; of Isaiah is omitted after &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>; though here it is supplied by the Masora as Keri. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-34</a> Isaiah concludes by announcing that Sennacherib will not come to Jerusalem, nor even shoot at the city and besiege it, but will return disappointed, because the Lord will defend and save the city for the sake of His promise. The result of the whole prophecy is introduced with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;: therefore, because this is how the matter stands, viz., as explained in what precedes. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, with regard to the king, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20</a>. &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, "he will not attack it with a shield," i.e., will not advance with shields to make an attack upon it. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>. It only occurs here in a hostile sense: to come against, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>, i.e., to advance against a city, to storm it. The four clauses of the verse stand in a graduated relation to one another: not to take, not even to shoot at and attack, yea, not even to besiege the city, will he come. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> we have <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a> taken up again, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a> is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> for the purpose of strengthening the promise. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; we have in Isaiah &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;: "by which he has come." The perfect is actually more exact, and the imperfect may be explained from the fact that Sennacherib was at that very time advancing against Jerusalem.

"For my sake," as Hezekiah had prayed in v. 19; and "for my servant David's sake," because Jehovah, as the unchangeably true One, must fulfil the promise which He gave to David (sees at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). </body></html>
