For the sign here given is not so much intended to be a token of their present deliverance from Sennacherib, which would be effected before the sign took place, as of their future preservation from him and the Assyrians, and of blessings which were to continue long after it. In other passages of Scripture we have signs given in the same manner, particularly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm" title="And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.">Exodus 3:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a>. At the time that Isaiah spoke this, nothing seemed more improbable than that the Jews, delivered from the Assyrians, should freely use and enjoy their own land, and be supported from its productions. They had cause to fear that the Assyrians would be greatly enraged at their shameful repulse, and the destruction of their army, and would quickly recruit their forces and come against them with far greater strength and violence than before. But if not, they had reason to fear another enemy equally formidable and destructive, a grievous famine. The Assyrian army had trodden down or eaten up all their corn, and the next year, which was the fifteenth of Hezekiah, was the sabbatical year, in which their law neither allowed them to plough nor sow. How were they to be supported? God engages they shall have sufficient support: <span class="ital">Ye shall eat this year — </span><span class="greekheb">ספיח</span>, <span class="ital">sapiach, sponte natum, </span>the natural produce of the ground, which the invasion of the Assyrian army in a great measure prevented you from ploughing and sowing. <span class="ital">And the second year, that which springeth of the</span> <span class="ital">same — </span><span class="greekheb">סחישׁ</span>, <span class="ital">sachish, sponte renatum, </span>the name here given to the spontaneous productions of the earth the second year that it had not been sown. <span class="ital">And in the third year, sow ye, and reap — </span>You shall not sow, and another reap, as has lately been the case; but you shall enjoy the fruit of your own labour. Now this was an excellent sign, for it was miraculous, especially considering the waste and destruction which the Assyrians had made in the land, and that the Jews had been forced to retire into their strong holds, and consequently to neglect their tilling, sowing, and reaping. And these events taking place accordingly, year after year, and the predictions being punctually fulfilled, the hopes of Hezekiah and his people would be revived and confirmed more and more, and assurance would be given them that they had nothing further to fear from the Assyrians, and that God would yet defend, bless, and prosper his people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:20-34 All Sennacherib's motions were under the Divine cognizance. God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as good ground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit in our lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophet now once more addresses Hezekiah, and gives him a "sign," or token, whereby he and his may be assured that Sennacherib is indeed bridled, and will not trouble Judaea anymore. It was a sign of the continued freedom of the land from attack during the whole of the remainder of Sennacherib's reign - a space of 17 years. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. Then Isaiah &#8230; sent&#8212;A revelation having been made to Isaiah, the prophet announced to the king that his prayer was heard. The prophetic message consisted of three different portions:&#8212;First, Sennacherib is apostrophized (2Ki 19:21-28) in a highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid vanity, haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian despot. Secondly, Hezekiah is addressed (2Ki 19:29-31), and a sign is given him of the promised deliverance&#8212;namely, that for two years the presence of the enemy would interrupt the peaceful pursuits of husbandry, but in the third year the people would be in circumstances to till their fields and vineyards and reap the fruits as formerly. Thirdly, the issue of Sennacherib's invasion is announced (2Ki 19:32-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A sign unto thee, </span> to wit, of the certain accomplishment of the promises here made to thee; that Zion should triumph over this insulting enemy, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-21.htm" title="This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.">2 Kings 19:21</a></span>; that God would not only preserve the city from his present fury, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-34.htm" title="For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.">2 Kings 19:34</a></span>, but also that God would bless his people with a durable prosperity, and a happy increase, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-30.htm" title="And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.">2 Kings 19:30</a>,31</span>. And thus it is not only a sign of a short deliverance, which would be past before this sign was fulfilled, (though there are instances of such signs as followed the thing done; as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm" title="And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.">Exodus 3:12</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a></span>) but of a future mercy, which was to continue long after that sign. And this sign was the more necessary, because otherwise Hezekiah and his people had cause to fear that the Assyrians would be greatly enraged for their shameful repulse, and the destruction of their army, and would quickly recruit their army, and return against them with far greater force and violence. But some affirm that Sennacherib, when he heard of Tirhakah’s march against him, of which <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm" title="And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,">2 Kings 19:9</a></span>, went with his army to meet him, and overthrew him, and the Egyptian who was joined with him, as was noted before; and prosecuted his victory by following them into Egypt and Ethiopia; in the conquest of which he spent two years, in which space the people did eat such things as grew of themselves; and in the third year returned to Jerusalem, intending to besiege it. It is true, it is said, and so the sign went before the thing, (which may be objected against the truth of this relation,)<span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-9.htm" title="And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,">2 Kings 19:9</a></span>, that <span class="ital">when he heard of Tirhakah, he sent messengers to Hezekiah</span>, pretending as if he would forthwith come against him; but it is not said that he did so, nor is it set down what he did with Tirhakah, because the design of the sacred writer was only to write the history of the Jewish nation; not of others, but only with respect to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the third year:</span> this was an excellent sign, for it was miraculous; especially considering the waste and havoc which the Assyrians had made in the land; and that the Jews had been forced to retire into their strong hold, and consequently to neglect their tilling, and sowing, and reaping; and yet this year they should have sufficient provision from those fruits of the earth which the Assyrian left; and the second year, which probably was the year of release, in which they might neither sow, nor reap from such fruits as the earth brought forth of its own accord; and so in the third year. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof; </span> you shall not sow, and another reap, as lately you did; but you shall enjoy the fruit of your own labours. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,.... The report of Rabshakeh's speech, recorded in the preceding chapter: <p>that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth; rent his clothes because of the blasphemy in the speech; and he put on sackcloth, in token of mourning, for the calamities he feared were coming on him and his people: and he went into the house of the Lord; the temple, to pray unto him. The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And this <i>shall be</i> a <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</span><p>(t) God not only promised him the victory, but gives him a sign to confirm his faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">And this</span> shall be <span class="ital">a</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">the</span>] <span class="ital">sign unto thee</span>] The next portion of the oracle is addressed to Hezekiah. On the giving of a sign to mark the certainty of a prophecy, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/7-11.htm" title="Ask you a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above....">Isaiah 7:11-14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ye shall eat</span> this <span class="ital">year such things as grow of themselves</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">that which groweth of itself</span>. The meaning of the sign appears to be this. Sennacherib was to be driven away from Jerusalem, yet though the land had been overrun by the enemy, and the people of Jerusalem had been shut up within the walls, they should find enough produce from what had been shed on the ground in the previous harvest time to serve them for the first year. In the next year they should be supplied in the same way, so that they could rest from the labours of the field, and both they and their lands enjoy a sabbatical year. Then in the third year they should commence undisturbedly their agricultural work, and enjoy their crops in peace. So that the sign looks far beyond the immediate deliverance (as also it does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a> just quoted) and proclaims to Jerusalem a prolonged period of peace and security.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this shall be a sign unto thee.</span> Another sudden change in the address. The prophet turns from Sennacherib to Hezekiah, and proceeds to give him a sign, and otherwise speak to him encouragingly. Signs were at the time freely offered and given by God both to the faithful and the unfaithful (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11, 14</a>). They generally consisted in the prediction of some near event, whose occurrence was to serve as a pledge, or evidence, of the probable fulfillment of another prediction of an event more distant. Such signs are not necessarily miraculous. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves.</span> The Assyrian invasion, coming early in the spring, as was usual, had prevented the Israelites from sowing their lands. But they would soon be gone, and then the Israelites could gather in such self-sown corn as they might find in the corn-lands. The next year, probably a sabbatical year, they were authorized to do the same, notwithstanding the general prohibition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5</a>); the third year they would return to their normal condition. The sign was not given with reference to Sennacherib's departure, which belonged to the first year, and must take place before the ingathering of the self-sown corn could begin, but with reference to the promise that Jerusalem should be free from any further attack on his part. Sennacherib reigned seventeen years longer, but led no further expedition into Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">And in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This derision falls upon the Assyrian, for having blasphemed the Lord God by his foolish boasting about his irresistible power. "Whom hast thou despised and blasphemed, and against whom hast thou lifted up the voice? and thou liftest up thine eyes against the Holy One of Israel." Lifting up the voice refers to the tone of threatening assumption, in which Rabshakeh and Sennacherib had spoken. Lifting up the eyes on high, i.e., to the heavens, signifies simply looking up to the sky (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>), not "directing proud looks against God" (Ges.). Still less is &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; to be taken adverbially in the sense of haughtily, as Thenius and Knobel suppose. The bad sense of proud arrogance lies in the words which follow, "against the Holy One of Israel," or in the case of Isaiah, where &#1488;&#1500; stands for &#1506;&#1500;, in the context, viz., the parallelism of the members. God is called the Holy One of Israel as He who manifests His holiness in and upon Israel. This title of the Deity is one of the peculiarities of Isaiah's range of thought, although it originated with Asaph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). This insult to the holy God consisted in the fact that Sennacherib had said through his servants (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm">2 Kings 19:24</a>): "With my chariots upon chariots I have ascended the height of the mountains, the uttermost part of Lebanon, so that I felled the tallness of its cedars, the choice of its cypresses, and came to the shelter of its border, to the forest of its orchard. I have dug and drunk strange water, so that I dried up all the rivers of Egypt with the sole of my feet." The words put into the mouth of the Assyrian are expressive of the feeling which underlay all his blasphemies (Drechsler). The two verses are kept quite uniform, the second hemistich in both cases expressing the result of the first, that is to say, what the Assyrian intended still further to perform after having accomplished what is stated in the first hemistich. When he has ascended the heights of Lebanon, he devastates the glorious trees of the mountain. Consequently in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm">2 Kings 19:24</a> the drying up of the Nile of Egypt is to be taken as the result of the digging of wells in the parched desert; in other words, it is to be interpreted as descriptive of the devastation of Egypt, whose whole fertility depended upon its being watered by the Nile and its canals. We cannot therefore take these verses exactly as Drechsler does; that is to say, we cannot assume that the Assyrian is speaking in the first hemistichs of both verses of what he (not necessarily Sennacherib himself, but one of his predecessors) has actually performed. For even if the ascent of the uttermost heights of Lebanon had been performed by one of the kings of Assyria, there is no historical evidence whatever that Sennacherib or one of his predecessors had already forced his way into Egypt. The words are therefore to be understood in a figurative sense, as an individualizing picture of the conquests which the Assyrians had already accomplished, and those which they were still intending to effect; and this assumption does not necessarily exhibit Sennacherib "as a mere braggart, who boastfully heaps up in ridiculous hyperbole an enumeration of the things which he means to perform" (Drechsler). For if the Assyrian had not ascended with the whole multitude of his war-chariots to the loftiest summits of Lebanon, to feel its cedars and its cypresses, Lebanon had set no bounds to his plans of conquest, so that Sennacherib might very well represent his forcing his way into Canaan as an ascent of the lofty peaks of this mountain range. Lebanon is mentioned, partly as a range of mountains that was quite inaccessible to war-chariots, and partly as the northern defence of the land of Canaan, through the conquest of which one made himself lord of the land. And so far as Lebanon is used synecdochically for the land of which it formed the defence, the hewing down of its cedars and cypresses, those glorious witnesses of the creation of God, denotes the devastation of the whole land, with all its glorious works of nature and of human hands. The chief strength of the early Asiatic conquerors consisted in the multitude of their war-chariots: they are therefore brought into consideration simply as signs of vast military resources; the fact that they could only be used on level ground being therefore disregarded. The Chethb &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;, "my chariots upon chariots," is used poetically for an innumerable multitude of chariots, as &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; for an innumerable host of locusts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>), and is more original than the Keri &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497; &#1512;&#1489;, the multitude of my chariots, which simply follows Isaiah. The "height of the mountains" is more precisely defined by the emphatic &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, the uttermost sides, i.e., the loftiest heights, of Lebanon, just as &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; &#1497;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-23.htm">Ezekiel 32:23</a> are the uttermost depths of Sheol. &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493; &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514;, his tallest cedars. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, his most select or finest cypresses. &#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, for which Isaiah has the more usual &#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493; &#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, "the height of his end," is the loftiest point of Lebanon on which a man can rest, not a lodging built on the highest point of Lebanon (Cler., Vitr., Ros.). &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;, the forest of his orchard, i.e., the forest resembling an orchard. The reference is to the celebrated cedar-forest between the loftiest peaks of Lebanon at the village of Bjerreh.</body></html>
