Those whose children are undutiful, ought to consider whether they have not been so to their Father in heaven? This history exhibits a strong proof of the good of firm trust and confidence in God. He will afflict, but not forsake his people. It is well when our troubles drive us to our knees. But does it not reprove our unbelief? How unwilling are we to rest on the declaration of Jehovah! How desirous to know in what way he will save us! How impatient when relief is delayed! But we must wait for the fulfilling of his word.

Nineveh, marked by some ruins opposite Mosul, appears here unmistakably as the Assyrian capital, which it became toward the close of the 9th century B.C. It has previously been mentioned only in Genesis (marginal reference). Sennacherib was the first king who made it his permanent residence. Its great size and large population are marked in the description of Jonah Jon 3:2-3; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>, whose visit probably fell about 760 B.C. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. So Sennacherib king of Assyria &#8230; went and returned&#8212;the same way as he came (2Ki 19:33). The route is described (Isa 10:28-32). The early chariot track near Beyrout is on the rocky edge of Lebanon, which is skirted by the ancient Lycus (Nahr-el Kelb). On the perpendicular face of the limestone rock, at different heights, are seen slabs with Assyrian inscriptions, which having been deciphered, are found to contain the name of Sennacherib. Thus, by the preservation of these tablets, the wrath of the Assyrian invaders is made to praise the Lord.<p>dwelt at Nineveh&#8212;This statement implies a considerable period of time, and his Annals carry on his history at least five years after his disastrous campaign at Jerusalem. No record of his catastrophe can be found, as the Assyrian practice was to record victories alone. The sculptures give only the sunny side of the picture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God spared <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sennacherib, </span> not in mercy, but in wrath, reserving him to a more dreadful and shameful death by the hands of his own children. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,.... The report of Rabshakeh's speech, recorded in the preceding chapter: <p>that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth; rent his clothes because of the blasphemy in the speech; and he put on sackcloth, in token of mourning, for the calamities he feared were coming on him and his people: and he went into the house of the Lord; the temple, to pray unto him. The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">36</span>. <span class="ital">and dwelt at Nineveh</span>] Apparently, and very naturally, deterred from any of his grander schemes by the terrible calamity which had befallen him, Sennacherib went to his own capital. How long a time elapsed between this overthrow around Jerusalem and the death of the king, spoken of in the next verse, we have not sufficient data to decide. The canon of Ptolemy fixes the accession of Sennacherib in b.c. 702, his death in b.c. 680. These dates cannot be made to harmonize with the Scripture chronology.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Sennacherib King of Assyria departed, and went and returned.</span> The, original is more lively, and more expressive of haste. Sennacherib, it is said, "decamped, and departed, and returned" - the heaping up of the verbs expressing the hurry of the march home (Keil); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt at Nineveh.</span> Nineveh was Sennacherib's favorite residence. He had built himself a palace, there, marked by the modern mound of Koyunjik. Sargon, his father, had dwelt mainly at Dur-Sargina or Khorsabad, Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaueser at Calah or Nimrod. Sennacherib's palace and his ether buildings at Nineveh are described in his annals at some length (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 50-52). The expression, "dwelt at Nineveh," does not mean that he never quitted it, but merely implies that he dwelt there for some considerable time after his return, as he appears to have done by his annals. The Eponym Canon makes his last year  <span class="date">B.C. 682</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sign is followed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-30.htm">2 Kings 19:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-31.htm">2 Kings 19:31</a> by the distinct promise of the deliverance of Judah and Jerusalem, for which Isaiah uses the sign itself as a type. "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again strike roots downwards and bear fruit upwards; for from Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and that which is escaped from Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah will do this." &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1505;&#1507;, to add roots, i.e., to strike fresh roots. The meaning is, that Judah will not succumb to this judgment. The remnant of the nation that has escaped from destruction by the Assyrians will once more grow and flourish vigorously; for from Jerusalem will a rescued remnant go forth. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; denotes those who have escaped destruction by the judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.). The deliverance was attached to Jerusalem or to Mount Zion, not so much because the power of the Assyrians was to be destroyed before the gates of Jerusalem, as because of the greater importance which Jerusalem and Mount Zion, as the centre of the kingdom of God, the seat of the God-King, possessed in relation to the covenant-nation, so that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, it was thence that the Messianic salvation was also to proceed. This deliverance is traced to the zeal of the Lord on behalf of His people and against His foes (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), like the coming of the Messiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> to establish an everlasting kingdom of peace and righteousness. The deliverance of Judah out of the power of Asshur was a prelude and type of the deliverance of the people of God by the Messiah out of the power of all that was ungodly. The &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; of Isaiah is omitted after &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>; though here it is supplied by the Masora as Keri. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-34</a> Isaiah concludes by announcing that Sennacherib will not come to Jerusalem, nor even shoot at the city and besiege it, but will return disappointed, because the Lord will defend and save the city for the sake of His promise. The result of the whole prophecy is introduced with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;: therefore, because this is how the matter stands, viz., as explained in what precedes. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, with regard to the king, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20</a>. &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, "he will not attack it with a shield," i.e., will not advance with shields to make an attack upon it. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>. It only occurs here in a hostile sense: to come against, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>, i.e., to advance against a city, to storm it. The four clauses of the verse stand in a graduated relation to one another: not to take, not even to shoot at and attack, yea, not even to besiege the city, will he come. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> we have <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a> taken up again, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a> is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> for the purpose of strengthening the promise. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; we have in Isaiah &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;: "by which he has come." The perfect is actually more exact, and the imperfect may be explained from the fact that Sennacherib was at that very time advancing against Jerusalem. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-34.htm">2 Kings 19:34</a> we have &#1488;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; instead of the &#1506;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; of Isaiah: &#1506;&#1500; is more correct than &#1488;&#1500;. "For my sake," as Hezekiah had prayed in v. 19; and "for my servant David's sake," because Jehovah, as the unchangeably true One, must fulfil the promise which He gave to David (sees at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). </body></html>
