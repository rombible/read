(So the versions, except that the Targum has “they slew.”) The blinding of Zedekiah need not have been done by the conqueror himself, although in the Assyrian sculptures kings are actually represented as blinding and otherwise torturing their captives. It is no argument against the singular, “he carried him to Babylon,” to say with Thenius that Zedekiah was sent to Babylon at once, while Nebuchadnezzar remained at Riblah. <span class= "ital">“</span>Qui facit per alium, facit per se.”<p><span class= "bld">The sons.</span>—Who fled with him (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm" title="Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.">Jeremiah 41:10</a>).

This seeming contradiction, Zedekiah the false prophet could not reconcile, and therefore concluded that both prophecies were false, and, if we may credit Josephus, Zedekiah the king stumbled at this difficulty. Both, however, were literally accomplished. The reflection which Josephus makes on this event, is worthy of the reader’s attention: “This may serve to convince even the ignorant, of the power and wisdom of God; and of the constancy of his counsels through all the various ways of his operations. It may likewise show us that God’s foreknowledge of things is certain; and his providence regular in the ordering of events; and besides, it holds forth a most exemplary instance of the danger of our giving way to the motions of sin and infidelity, which deprive us of the means of discerning God’s judgments, even though ready to fall upon us.” <span class="ital">— Antiq., </span>lib. 10., cap. 11.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before his eyes - This refinement of cruelty seems to have especially shocked the Jews, whose manners were less barbarous than those of most Orientals. It is noted by Jeremiah in two places <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10</a>.<p>And put out the eyes of Zedekiah - Blinding has always been among the most common of secondary punishments in the East (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-2.htm">Judges 16:2</a> l). The blinding of Zedekiah reconciled in a very remarkable way prophecies, apparently contradictory, which had been made concerning him. Jeremiah had prophesied distinctly that he would be carried to Babylon <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-5.htm">Jeremiah 32:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>. Ezekiel had said that he should not "see Babylon" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>. His deprivation of sight before he was carried to the conqueror's capital fulfilled the predictions of both prophets.<p>With fetters of brass - literally, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-7.htm">Jeremiah 39:7</a> margin), "with two chains of brass." The Assyrians' captives are usually represented as bound hand and foot - the two hands secured by one chain, the two feet by another. According to Jewish tradition Zedekiah was, like other slaves, forced to work in a mill at Babylon. Jeremiah tells us that he was kept in prison until he died <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. they took the king, and brought him &#8230; to Riblah&#8212;Nebuchadnezzar, having gone from the siege to oppose the auxiliary forces of Pharaoh-hophra, left his generals to carry on the blockade, he himself not returning to the scene of action, but taking up his station at Riblah in the land of Hamath (2Ki 23:33).<p>they gave judgment upon him&#8212;They, that is, the council (Jer 39:3, 13; Da 6:7, 8, 12), regarding him as a seditious and rebellious vassal, condemned him for violating his oath and neglecting the announcement of the divine will as made known to him by Jeremiah (compare Jer 32:5; 34:2; 38:17). His sons and the nobles who had joined in his flight were slain before his eyes (Jer 39:6; 52:10). In conformity with Eastern ideas, which consider a blind man incapable of ruling, his eyes were put out, and being put in chains, he was carried to perpetual imprisonment in Babylon (Jer 52:11), which, though he came to it, as Ezekiel had foretold, he did not see (Jer 32:5; Eze 12:13; 17:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thus two prophecies were fulfilled, which seemed contrary one to the other, <span class="ital">that he should go to Babylon</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-5.htm" title="And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, said the LORD: though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper.">Jeremiah 32:5</a> 34:3</span>, and that <span class="ital">he should never see Babylon</span>; which seeming contradiction, because Zedekiah the false prophet could not reconcile, he concluded both were false, and that Jeremiah was a false prophet; and it seems Zedekiah the king might stumble at this difficulty. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign,....

To do it in the sight of the father was to break down all his hope of any rightful successor taking his throne. The narrative in Jeremiah adds that Nebuchadnezzar ‘slew all the nobles of Judah’. Not only was the royal family destroyed, but the men of power and influence were all extinguished.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">put out the eyes of Zedekiah</span>] This punishment the Philistines inflicted on Samson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm" title="But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.">Jdg 16:21</a>) before they put him in the prison-house. The LXX. had this instance so much in mind that they say Zedekiah was put <span class="greekheb">εἰς οἰκίαν μύλωνος</span>. The deprivation of the eyes was not uncommon in the East as a punishment (cf. Herod. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-18.htm" title="And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:">2 Kings 7:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is very striking to put side by side the two prophecies concerning Zedekiah uttered the one by Jeremiah, the other by Ezekiel. The former said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-3.htm" title="You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but you feed not the flock.">Ezekiel 34:3</a>) ‘Thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm" title="And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;">Jeremiah 32:4</a>); the latter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-13.htm" title="However, there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:">2 Kings 12:13</a>) says of this king ‘I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldæans, yet shall he not see it though he shall die there’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and bound him with fetters of brass</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">in fetters</span>. There is no need to express the metal of which the fetters were made. In English on the contrary we speak of ‘putting a man in <span class="ital">irons</span>’ and omit ‘fetters’.

Herod., 3:14, and 2 Macc. 7, for similar aggravations of condemned persons' sufferings). As Zedekiah was no more than thirty-two years of age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), his sons must have been minors, who could not justly be held responsible for their father's doings. It was usual, however, in the East, and even among the Jews, to punish children for the sins of their fathers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And put out the eyes of Zedekiah.</span> This, too, was a common Oriental practice. The Philistines blinded Samson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). Sargon, in one of his sculptures, seems to be blinding a prisoner with a spear (Botta, 'Monumens de Ninive,' pl. 18). The ancient Persians often blinded criminals (Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:9. &sect; 13; Ammian. Mare., 27:12; Procop., 'De Bell. Pers.,' 1:11. p. 80). In modern Persia, it was, until very lately, usual for a king, on his accession, to blind all his brothers, in order that they might be disqualified from reigning. The operation was commonly performed in Persia by means of a red-hot iron rod (see Herod., 7:18). Zedekiah's loss of eyesight reconciled the two apparently conflicting prophecies - that he would be carried captive to Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>, etc.), and that he would never see it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>) - in a remarkable manner. <span class="cmt_word">And bound him with fetters of brass</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with a pair of brazen fetters</span>. Assyrian fetters consisted of two thick rings of iron, joined together by a single long link (Botta, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>); Babylonian were probably similar. Captives of importance are usually represented as fettered in the sculptures. <span class="cmt_word">And carried him to Babylon.</span> Jeremiah adds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar "put him in prison till the day of his death:" and so Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 7). The latter writer further tells us that, at his death, the Babylonian monarch gave him a royal funeral (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Siege and conquest of Jerusalem; Zedekiah taken prisoner and led away to Babel (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4-11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1-7</a>). - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>. In the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar marched with all his forces against Jerusalem and commenced the siege (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>), after he had taken all the rest of the fortified cities of the land, with the exception of Lachish and Azekah, which were besieged at the same time as Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>). On the very same day the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem was revealed to the prophet Ezekiel in his exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a>). "And they built against it (the city) siege-towers round about." &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, which only occurs here and in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a>), does not mean either a line of circumvallation (J. D. Mich., Hitzig), or the outermost enclosure constructed of palisades (Thenius, whose assertion that &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; is always mentioned as the first work of the besiegers is refuted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a>), but a watch, and that in a collective sense: watch-towers or siege-towers (cf.
