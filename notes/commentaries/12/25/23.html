Nebuchadnezzar &#8230; made Gedaliah &#8230; ruler&#8212;The people permitted to remain were, besides the king's daughters, a few court attendants and others (Jer 40:7) too insignificant to be removed, only the peasantry who could till the land and dress the vineyards. Gedaliah was Jeremiah's friend (Jer 26:24), and having, by the prophet's counsel, probably fled from the city as abandoned of God, he surrendered himself to the conqueror (Jer 38:2, 17), and being promoted to the government of Judea, fixed his provincial court at Mizpeh. He was well qualified to surmount the difficulties of ruling at such a crisis. Many of the fugitive Jews, as well as the soldiers of Zedekiah who had accompanied the king in his flight to the plains of Jericho, left their retreats (Jer 40:11, 12) and flocked around the governor; who having counselled them to submit, promised them on complying with this condition, security on oath that they would retain their possessions and enjoy the produce of their land (Jer 40:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The captains of the armies, </span> which escaped away when Zedekiah was taken. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm" title="And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.">2 Kings 25:4</a>"</span>, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-5.htm" title="And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.">2 Kings 25:5</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as for the people that remained,....

We are told (Jeremiah 41) that when Jeremiah was set at liberty by Nebuzar-adan at Ramah he at once made his way to Gedaliah; beside that the captains of the forces gathered to him, and so did the Jews that had escaped into the countries round about, Moab, Ammon and Edom; and it is said ‘they gathered wine and summer fruits very much’. Meantime Gedaliah was warned that Baalis the king of the Ammonites had sent Ishmael to slay him, but he refused to credit the report, and when one of his friends voluntered to slay Ishmael, Gedaliah would not permit it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">captains of the armies</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">forces</span>.

How he was connected with the royal blood we cannot discover. He had been in the country of the Ammonites during the destruction of Jerusalem, and when Gedaliah was set up as governor in Mizpah he came into Judah, apparently at the instigation of Baalis, king of Ammon, with the purpose of slaying Gedaliah and occupying his place. At first he acted as if friendly to Gedaliah, but after a short time, at a banquet where he and ten friends were entertained by Gedaliah, the murder of the governor was perpetrated, and at the same time all the Jews in the house with Gedaliah were likewise slain. All this was done with such precaution and secrecy that for two days nobody outside the governor’s palace knew what had been done. After that time Ishmael, observing a party of fourscore pilgrims coming towards Mizpah, went to meet them, and bringing them into the courtyard of the house as if to see Gedaliah, had all but ten of them killed and cast into the well in the court. He now resolved on flight and taking away with him the daughters of Zedekiah, who had been put under Gedaliah’s charge, he turned his steps to the land of Ammon. But Johanan and the other captains, who had by this time discovered the atrocious murders, pursued Ishmael, yet though they came up with him and his party ‘by the great waters that were in Gibeon’, and though Ishmael’s followers were at once ready to desert him, the villain, and eight more with him, escaped into the country of the Ammonites.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Johanan the son of Careah</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Kareah</span>.

He is there classed among ‘all the proud men’.

To this there is appended a remark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a> concerning the quantity of the brass of the large vessels, which was so great that it could not be weighed; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a> a supplementary notice respecting the artistic work of the two pillars of brass. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is placed at the head absolutely: as for the pillars, etc., the brass of all these vessels was not to be weighed. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>, along with the brazen sea, the twelve brazen oxen under it are mentioned; and in the description of the pillars of brass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>.) there are several points alluded to which are omitted in our books, not only here, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-16.htm">1 Kings 7:16</a>. For the fact itself see the explanation given there. The omission of the twelve oxen in so condensed an account as that contained in our text does not warrant the inference that these words in Jeremiah are a spurious addition made by a later copyist, since the assumption that Ahaz sent the brazen oxen to king Tiglath-pileser cannot be proved from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>. Instead of &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473; we must read &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, five cubits, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-22.htm">Jeremiah 52:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-16.htm">1 Kings 7:16</a>. The &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492; at the end of the verse is very striking, since it stands quite alone, and when connected with &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; does not appear to yield any appropriate sense, as the second pillar was like the first not merely with regard to the trellis-work, but in its form and size throughout. At the same time, it is possible that the historian intended to give especial prominence to the similarity of the two pillars with reference to this one point alone.</body></html>
