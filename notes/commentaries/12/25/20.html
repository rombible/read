By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of the city - This clause shows that the five persons mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a> were taken out of the temple.<p>Five men - Or, "seven men," according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>.

Two batches of prisoners seem to have been brought before Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah - first, the most important of all the captives, Zedekiah and his sons (vers. 6, 7); then, a month later, Seraiah the high priest, and the other persons enumerated in vers. 18 and 19. The remaining prisoners were no doubt brought also by Nebuzar-adan to Ribiah, but were not conducted into the presence of the king. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brazen vessels of the temple were broken in pieces, and the brass, and smaller vessels of brass, silver, and gold, were carried away. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17-23</a>, where several other points are mentioned that have been passed over in the account before us. The pillars of brass (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>.), the stands (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27</a>.), and the brazen sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>.), were broken in pieces, because it would have been difficult to carry these colossal things away without breaking them up. On the smaller vessels used in the worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-14.htm">2 Kings 25:14</a>) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-18.htm">Jeremiah 52:18</a> &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1514; are also mentioned. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a> is abridged still more in contrast with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a>, and only &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; are mentioned, whereas in Jeremiah six different things are enumerated beside the candlesticks. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507;...&#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "what was of gold, gold, what was of silver, silver, the captain of the guard took away," is a comprehensive description of the objects carried away. To this there is appended a remark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a> concerning the quantity of the brass of the large vessels, which was so great that it could not be weighed; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a> a supplementary notice respecting the artistic work of the two pillars of brass. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is placed at the head absolutely: as for the pillars, etc., the brass of all these vessels was not to be weighed. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>, along with the brazen sea, the twelve brazen oxen under it are mentioned; and in the description of the pillars of brass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>.) there are several points alluded to which are omitted in our books, not only here, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-16.htm">1 Kings 7:16</a>. For the fact itself see the explanation given there. The omission of the twelve oxen in so condensed an account as that contained in our text does not warrant the inference that these words in Jeremiah are a spurious addition made by a later copyist, since the assumption that Ahaz sent the brazen oxen to king Tiglath-pileser cannot be proved from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>. Instead of &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473; we must read &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, five cubits, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-22.htm">Jeremiah 52:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-16.htm">1 Kings 7:16</a>. The &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492; at the end of the verse is very striking, since it stands quite alone, and when connected with &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; does not appear to yield any appropriate sense, as the second pillar was like the first not merely with regard to the trellis-work, but in its form and size throughout. At the same time, it is possible that the historian intended to give especial prominence to the similarity of the two pillars with reference to this one point alone.</body></html>
