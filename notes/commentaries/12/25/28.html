So Cyrus kept Croesus king of Lydia at his court (Herod, i. 88). We may remember also the chivalrous behaviour of our own Black Prince towards his royal captive John of France.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:22-30 The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore. Sin alone can hurt us; Jesus alone can do good to sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The kings that were with him - Probably captive kings, like Jehoiachin himself.

This kindly feeling is said to have originated in a familiar acquaintance formed in prison, in which Evil-merodach had lain till his father's death, on account of some malversation while acting as regent during Nebuchadnezzar's seven years' illness (Da 4:32, 33). But doubtless the improvement in Zedekiah's condition is to be traced to the overruling providence and grace of Him who still cherished purposes of love to the house of David (2Sa 7:14, 15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It seems, though the power of these kings was taken away, yet some honour and respect was given to them, even in the place of their captivity, and to Jehoiachin more than to any of the rest. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass in the thirty and seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah,....

That other kings were in the same condition as Jehoiachin, and had been brought to Babylon because they were troublesome in their own countries, we can see from this verse. Some however were imprisoned, as Jehoiachin had been, while others were at liberty but confined to Babylon and the court.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake kindly to him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he spake good things with him</span>; but the meaning is well expressed by our rendering.

An honorable position and probably a seat of honor was assigned to each; but the highest position among them was now conferred on Jehoiachin. Whether he had actually a more elevated seat, is (as Bahr observes) a mattes of no importance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Installation of Gedaliah the governor. His assassination, and the flight of the people to Egypt. - Much fuller accounts have been handed down to us in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40-44</a> of the events which are but briefly indicated here.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-23</a><p>Over the remnant of the people left in the land Nebuchadnezzar placed Gedaliah as governor of the land, who took up his abode in Mizpah. Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, who had interested himself on behalf of the prophet Jeremiah and saved his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), and the grandson of Shaphan, a man of whom nothing more is known (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12</a>), had his home in Jerusalem, and, as we may infer from his attitude towards Jeremiah, had probably secured the confidence of the Chaldaeans at the siege and conquest of Jerusalem by his upright conduct, and by what he did to induce the people to submit to the judgment inflicted by God; so that Nebuchadnezzar entrusted him with the oversight of those who were left behind in the land-men, women, children, poor people, and even a few princesses and court-officials, whom they had not thought it necessary or worth while to carry away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm">Jeremiah 41:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>), i.e., he made him governor of the conquered land. Mizpah is the present Nebi Samwil, two hours to the north-west of Jerusalem (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>). - On hearing of Gedaliah's appointment as governor, there came to him "all the captains of the several divisions of the army and their men," i.e., those portions of the army which had been scattered at the flight of the king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-5.htm">2 Kings 25:5</a>), and which had escaped from the Chaldaeans, and, as it is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>, had dispersed themselves "in the field," i.e., about the land. Instead of &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a> the clearer expression &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, "and their men," whilst &#1493;&#1492;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; in our text receives its more precise definition from the previous word &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. Of the military commanders the following are mentioned by name: Ishmael, etc. (the &#1493; eht( .cte ,l before &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, is explic., "and indeed Ishmael"). Ishmael, son of Mattaniah and grandson of Elishama, probably of the king's secretary mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-20.htm">Jeremiah 36:20</a>, of royal blood. Nothing further is known about the other names. We simply learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-13.htm">Jeremiah 40:13</a>. that Johanan had warned Gedaliah against the treachery of Ishmael, and that when Gedaliah was slain by Ishmael, having disregarded the warning, he put himself at the head of the people and marched with them to Egypt, notwithstanding the dissuasions of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-15.htm">Jeremiah 41:15</a>.). Instead of "Johanan the son of Kareah," we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a> "Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah;" but it is uncertain whether &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; has crept into the text of Jeremiah from the previous &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1495;&#1504;&#1503; merely through a mistake, and this mistake has brought with it the alteration of &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (Ewald), or whether &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; has dropped out of our text through an oversight, and this omission has occasioned the alteration of &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1489;&#1503; (Thenius, Graf, etc.). The former supposition is favoured by the circumstance that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-13.htm">Jeremiah 40:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-11.htm">Jeremiah 41:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>, Johanan the son of Kareah alone is mentioned.

He was called Netophathite because he sprang from Netopha in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-26.htm">Nehemiah 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-22.htm">Ezra 2:22</a>), the identity of which with Beit Nettif is by no means probable (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-28.htm">2 Samuel 23:28</a>). The name &#1497;&#1488;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is written &#1497;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; in Jeremiah; he was the son of the Maachathite, i.e., his father sprang from the Syrian district of Maacah in the neighbourhood of the Hermon (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>).</body></html>
