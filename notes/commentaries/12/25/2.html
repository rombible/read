In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The siege lasted almost exactly a year and a half.

Jerusalem Again Besieged.<p>1. Nebuchadnezzar &#8230; came &#8230; against Jerusalem&#8212;Incensed by the revolt of Zedekiah, the Assyrian despot determined to put an end to the perfidious and inconstant monarchy of Judea. This chapter narrates his third and last invasion, which he conducted in person at the head of an immense army, levied out of all the tributary nations under his sway. Having overrun the northern parts of the country and taken almost all the fenced cities (Jer 34:7), he marched direct to Jerusalem to invest it. The date of the beginning as well as the end of the siege is here carefully marked (compare Eze 24:1; Jer 39:1; 52:4-6); from which it appears, that, with a brief interruption caused by Nebuchadnezzar's marching to oppose the Egyptians who were coming to its relief but who retreated without fighting, the siege lasted a year and a half. So long a resistance was owing, not to the superior skill and valor of the Jewish soldiers, but to the strength of the city fortifications, on which the king too confidently relied (compare Jer 21:1-14; 37:1-38:28).<p>pitched against it, and &#8230; built forts&#8212;rather, perhaps, drew lines of circumvallation, with a ditch to prevent any going out of the city. On this rampart were erected his military engines for throwing missiles into the city.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign,....

We know however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-7.htm" title="When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defended cities remained of the cities of Judah.">Jeremiah 34:7</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar’s troops were engaged at the same time in attacking Lachish and Azekah. So that a part only of his soldiers were employed against Jerusalem. We find too (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm" title="Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 37:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,">Jeremiah 37:11</a>) that, on the report that the army of Pharaoh was coming forth out of Egypt, the siege of Jerusalem was so far relaxed that Jeremiah undertook to leave the city and depart into the land of Benjamin but was stopped at the gate by Irijah.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of King Zedekiah</span>. The writer omits all the details of the siege, and hastens to the final catastrophe. From Jeremiah and Ezekiel we learn that, after the siege had continued a certain time, the Egyptian monarch, Hophra or Apries, made an effort to carry out the terms of his agreement with Zedekiah, and marched an army into Southern Judaea, with the view of raising the siege (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>). Nebuchadnezzar hastened to meet him. With the whole or the greater part of his host he marched southward and offered battle to the Egyptians. Whether an engagement took place or not is uncertain. Josephus affirms it, and says that Apries was "defeated and driven out of Syria" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 3). The silence of Jeremiah is thought to throw doubt on his assertion. At any rate, the Egyptians retired (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>) and took no further part in the struggle. The Babylonians returned, and the siege recommenced. A complete blockade was established, and the defenders of the city soon began to suffer from famine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12, 20</a>). Ere long, as so often happens in sieges, famine was followed by pestilence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-6.htm">Jeremiah 21:6, 7</a>; Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), and after a time the place was reduced to the last extremity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3-9</a>). Bread was no longer to be had, and mothers devoured their children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>). At length a breach was effected in the defenses; the enemy poured in; and the city fell (see the comment on ver. 4). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Beside these treasures, he carried away captive to Babylon the cream of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, not only the most affluent, but, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-10</a>, the best portion in a moral respect. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a> the number of those who were carried off is simply given in a general form, according to its sum-total, as 10,000; and then in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a> the details are more minutely specified. "All Jerusalem" is the whole of the population of Jerusalem, which is first of all divided into two leading classes, and then more precisely defined by the clause, "nothing was left except the common people," and reduced to the cream of the citizens. The king, queen-mother, and king's wives being passed over and mentioned for the first time in the special list in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, there are noticed here &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, who form the first of the leading classes. By the &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are meant, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, the &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, chamberlains, i.e., the officials of the king's court in general, and by &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; ("the mighty of the land") all the heads of the tribes and families of the nation that were found in Jerusalem; and under the last the priests and prophets, who were also carried away according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1</a>, with Ezekiel among them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>), are included as the spiritual heads of the people. The &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; are called &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>; their number was 7000. The persons intended are not warriors, but men of property, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>. The second class of those who ere carried away consisted of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, all the workers in stone, metal, and wood, that is to say, masons, smiths, and carpenters; and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, the locksmiths, including probably not actual locksmiths only, but makers of weapons also. There is no need for any serious refutation of the marvellous explanation given of &#1502;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512; by Hitzig (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>), who derives it from &#1502;&#1505; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, and supposes it to be an epithet applied to the remnant of the Canaanites, who had been made into tributary labourers, although it has been adopted by Thenius and Graf, who make them into artisans of the foreign socagers. &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;  equals  &#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>), the poor people of the land, i.e., the lower portion of the population of Jerusalem, from whom Nebuchadnezzar did not fear any rebellion, because they possessed nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>), i.e., neither property (money nor other possessions), nor strength and ability to organize a revolt. The antithesis to these formed by the &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1502; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, the strong or powerful men, who were in a condition to originate and carry on a war; for this category includes all who were carried away, not merely the thousand workmen, but also the seven thousand &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, and the king's officers and the chiefs of the nation, whose number amounted to two thousand, since the total number of the exiles was then thousand. There is no special allusion to warriors or military, because in the struggle for the rescue of the capital and the kingdom from destruction every man who could bear arms performed military service, so that the distinction between warriors and non-warriors was swept away, and the actual warriors are swallowed up in the ten thousand. Babel is the country of Babylonia, or rather the Babylonian empire. </body></html>
