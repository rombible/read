It was a kind of foreshadowing of the pity which afterwards was to be extended to the captive people, when the divine purpose had been achieved, and the exile had done its work of chastisement and purification.

But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore.

But it is quite as likely to have been a money payment. The word translated by "allowance"  - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> - does not point necessarily to food. It is a "portion' of any kind. <span class="cmt_word">Given him of the king</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, out of the privy purse, by the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">a daily rate for every day</span> - or, a c<span class="accented">ertain amount day by</span> day - <span class="cmt_word">all the days of his life</span> (see the comment on the preceding verse). Beth the privileges accorded to Jehoiachin, his sustenance at the king's table, and his allowance, whether in money or in kind, continued to the day of his death. Neither of them was ever revoked or forfeited. Thus this last representative of the Davidic monarchy, after thirty-six years of chastisement, experienced a happy change of circumstances, and died in peace and comfort. Probably, as Keil says, "this event was intended as a comforting sign to the whole of the captive people, that the Lord would one day put an end to their banishment, if they would acknowledge that it was a well-merited punishment for their sins that they had been driven away from before his face, and would turn again to the Lord their God with all their heart." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As these men were afraid of the vengeance of the Chaldaeans because they had fought against them, Gedaliah assured them on oath that they had nothing to fear from them if they would dwell peaceably in the land, be submissive to the king of Babel, and cultivate the land (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-9.htm">Jeremiah 40:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>).
