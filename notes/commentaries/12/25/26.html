But they would not hearken. Thus this populous and fertile country was laid waste and desolate, part of the people being carried captive to Babylon, part of those who were left in the land being slain with Gedaliah, and the remainder fleeing into Egypt. So that it was left to be overrun with briers and thorns, and to be inhabited by wild beasts. Only some of the neighbouring nations seem to have settled themselves in some parts of it. And from hence the Jews found much greater difficulty when they came to be restored than they would have done if some of them had continued in their country and cultivated it. <span class="ital">For they were afraid of the Chaldees </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Chaldeans had reason enough to be offended at the murder of Gedaliah; but, if those that remained had humbly remonstrated to them, that it was only the act of Ishmael and his party, we may suppose they who were innocent of it, nay, who suffered greatly by it, would not have been punished for it: but, under pretence of this apprehension they all went into Egypt, where, it is probable, they mixed with the Egyptians by degrees, and were never heard of more as Israelites. Thus there was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience, and Egypt had the last of them, that the last verse of that chapter of threatenings might be fulfilled after all the rest, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-68.htm" title="And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spoke to you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall be sold to your enemies for slaves and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.">Deuteronomy 28:68</a>,) <span class="ital">The Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again. </span>For a more particular account of these events see the prophecy of Jeremiah, from chap. 40. to chap. 45.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:22-30 The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore.

The leader of the movement was Johanan, the son of Careah. Having first attacked Ishmael, and forced him to fly to the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-15.htm">Jeremiah 41:15</a>), he almost immediately afterwards conceived a fear of Nebuchadnezzar, who would, he thought, resent the murder of Gedaliah, and even avenge it upon these who had done all they could to prevent it. He therefore gathered together the people, and made a preliminary retreat to Chimham, near Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a>), on the road to Egypt, whence he subsequently, against the earnest remonstrances and prophetic warnings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9-22</a>, carried them on into Egypt itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-1.htm">Jeremiah 43:1-7</a>).

There does not appear to have been any real reason for this fear. Nebuchadnezzar might have been trusted to distinguish between the act of an individual and conspiracy on the part of the nation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the city, i.e., from the civil authorities of the city, Nebuzaradan took a king's chamberlain (&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;), who was commander of the men of war.

"And five (according to Jeremiah seven) men of those who saw the king's face," i.e., who belonged to the king's immediate circle, de intimis consiliariis regis, and "the scribe of the commander-in-chief, who raised the people of the land for military service," or who enrolled them.

"And sixty men of the land-population who were found in the city." They were probably some of the prominent men of the rural districts, or they may have taken a leading part in the defence of the city, and therefore were executed in Riblah, and not merely deported with the rest of the people. - The account of the destruction of the kingdom of Judah closes with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>, "thus was Judah carried away out of its own land;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-26</a> there follows merely a brief notice of those who had been left behind in the land, in the place of which we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-28.htm">Jeremiah 52:28-30</a> a detailed account of the number of those who were carried away. </body></html>
