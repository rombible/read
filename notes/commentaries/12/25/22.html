Nebuzaradan committed the prophet to the care of Gedaliah, who probably, like his father, sympathised with Jeremiah’s views (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/39-13.htm" title="So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;">Jeremiah 39:13-14</a>). After hesitating whether to accompany Nebuzaradan to Babylon or not, the prophet finally decided upon repairing to Gedaliah at Mizpah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.">Jeremiah 40:1-6</a>). Gedaliah’s magnanimous behaviour in regard to Ishmael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-16.htm" title="But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing: for you speak falsely of Ishmael.">Jeremiah 40:16</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) shows that he was not a traitor and deserter as some have misnamed him. Rather he was a disciple of Jeremiah, and did his utmost to induce the remnant over which he was appointed governor to submit with patience to their divinely-ordered lot, as the prophet urged them to do.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm" title="And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.">2 Kings 25:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Over them he made Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, ruler — </span>A righteous and good man, and a friend to the Prophet Jeremiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a>. Ahikam, his father, was a person in such credit in all the latter reigns, that he had been able to screen Jeremiah from the resentment of the king and the fury of the people; so that it is very probable the prophet, in gratitude to the father, obtained this favour for the son, from Nebuzaradan. Or, as some think, Gedaliah, by the advice of Jeremiah, had gone over to the Chaldeans, and had approved himself so well, that on that account the king of Babylon judged it proper to intrust him with the government. Gedaliah’s good conduct, together with the obligations which Jeremiah was under to his father, was probably the motive which induced the prophet to live with him in Judea rather than go to Babylon, when the Chaldean general put it to his option, not without some considerable encouragement to invite him to the latter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-11.htm" title="Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,">Jeremiah 39:11</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:22-30 The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protector of the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore.

Gedaliah was Jeremiah's friend (Jer 26:24), and having, by the prophet's counsel, probably fled from the city as abandoned of God, he surrendered himself to the conqueror (Jer 38:2, 17), and being promoted to the government of Judea, fixed his provincial court at Mizpeh. He was well qualified to surmount the difficulties of ruling at such a crisis. Many of the fugitive Jews, as well as the soldiers of Zedekiah who had accompanied the king in his flight to the plains of Jericho, left their retreats (Jer 40:11, 12) and flocked around the governor; who having counselled them to submit, promised them on complying with this condition, security on oath that they would retain their possessions and enjoy the produce of their land (Jer 40:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A righteous and good man, and a friend to the prophet Jeremiah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as for the people that remained,....

Nebuchadnezzar, when he carried off Zedekiah to Babylon, appointed, as governor of Judaea, a certain Gedaliah, a Jew of good position, but not of the royal family. Gedaliah made Mizpah, near Jerusalem, his residence; and here he was shortly joined by a number of Jews of importance, who had escaped from Jerusalem and hidden themselves until the Babylonians were gone. Of these the most eminent were Johanan the son of Karcah, and Ishmael, a member of the royal house of David. Gedaliah urged the refugees to be good subjects of the King of Babylon, and to settle themselves to agricultural pursuits. His advice was accepted and at first followed; but presently a warning was given to Gedaliah by Johanan that Ishmael designed his destruction; and soon afterwards, as Gedaliah took no precautions, the murder was actually carried out. Other atrocities followed; but after a time Johanan and the other leading refugees took up arms, forced Ishmael to fly to the Ammonites, and then, fearing that Nebuchadnezzar would hold them responsible for Ishmael's act, against Jeremiah's remonstrances, fled, with the great mass of the Jews that had been left in the land, from Judaea into Egypt. Here our writer leaves them (ver. 26), without touching on the calamities which befell them there, according to the prophetic announcements of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2-28</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah.</span> These con-stated of Gedaliah and his court, which included Jeremiah, Baruch, and some princesses of the royal house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm">Jeremiah 43:6</a>); the poor of the land, whom Nebuzar-adan had intentionally left behind; and a considerable number of Jewish refugees of a better class, who came in from the neighboring nations, and from places in Judaea where they had been hiding themselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7-12</a>). For about two months all went well with this "remnant," who applied themselves to agricultural pursuits, in which they prospered greatly. <span class="cmt_word">Whom Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon had left</span> (see ver. 12), <span class="cmt_word">even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</span> Ahikam had protected Jeremiah in his earlier days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>); Gedaliah protected him in the latter part of the siege (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>). Nebuchadnezzar's choice of Gedaliah for governor was probably made from some knowledge of his having sided with Jeremiah, whose persistent endeavors to make the Jews submit to the Babylonian yoke seem to have been well known, not only to the Jews, but to the Babylonians; most likely by reason of the letter he sent to his countrymen already in captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Shaphan, ruler.</span> Probably not "Shaphan the scribe" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3, 12</a>), but an unknown person of the same name. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brazen vessels of the temple were broken in pieces, and the brass, and smaller vessels of brass, silver, and gold, were carried away. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17-23</a>, where several other points are mentioned that have been passed over in the account before us. The pillars of brass (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>.), the stands (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27</a>.), and the brazen sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>.), were broken in pieces, because it would have been difficult to carry these colossal things away without breaking them up. On the smaller vessels used in the worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-14.htm">2 Kings 25:14</a>) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>.

To this there is appended a remark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm">2 Kings 25:16</a> concerning the quantity of the brass of the large vessels, which was so great that it could not be weighed; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a> a supplementary notice respecting the artistic work of the two pillars of brass. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is placed at the head absolutely: as for the pillars, etc., the brass of all these vessels was not to be weighed. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>, along with the brazen sea, the twelve brazen oxen under it are mentioned; and in the description of the pillars of brass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>.) there are several points alluded to which are omitted in our books, not only here, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-16.htm">1 Kings 7:16</a>. For the fact itself see the explanation given there. The omission of the twelve oxen in so condensed an account as that contained in our text does not warrant the inference that these words in Jeremiah are a spurious addition made by a later copyist, since the assumption that Ahaz sent the brazen oxen to king Tiglath-pileser cannot be proved from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>. Instead of &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473; we must read &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;, five cubits, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-22.htm">Jeremiah 52:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-16.htm">1 Kings 7:16</a>. The &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492; at the end of the verse is very striking, since it stands quite alone, and when connected with &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1499;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; does not appear to yield any appropriate sense, as the second pillar was like the first not merely with regard to the trellis-work, but in its form and size throughout. At the same time, it is possible that the historian intended to give especial prominence to the similarity of the two pillars with reference to this one point alone.</body></html>
