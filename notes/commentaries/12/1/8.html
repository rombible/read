Sin weakens and impoverishes us. Man's revolt from God is often punished by the rebellion of those who owe subjection to him. Ahaziah fell through a lattice, or railing. Wherever we go, there is but a step between us and death. A man's house is his castle, but not to secure him against God's judgments. The whole creation, which groans under the burden of man's sin, will, at length, sink and break under the weight like this lattice. He is never safe that has God for his enemy.

His costume was that of a thorough ascetic. Generally the Jews wore girdles of linen or cotton stuff, soft and comfortable. Under the girdle they wore one or two long linen gowns or shirts, and over these they had sometimes a large shawl. Elijah had only his leather girdle and his sheepskin cape or "mantle." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. an hairy man&#8212;This was the description not of his person, as in the case of Esau, but of his dress, which consisted either of unwrought sheep or goatskins (Heb 11:37), or of camel's haircloth&#8212;the coarser manufacture of this material like our rough haircloth. The Dervishes and Bedouins are attired in this wild, uncouth manner, while their hair flows loose on the head, their shaggy cloak is thrown over their shoulders and tied in front on the breast, naked, except at the waist, round which is a skin girdle&#8212;a broad, rough leathern belt.

He was <span class="ital">a hairy man</span>] Literally, ‘lord, i.e. possessor, of hair’. This might equally be used of the long hair of the head and beard, or of the shaggy cloak of hair worn as a garment. But when we know of him who came ‘in the spirit and power of Elijah’ that ‘his <span class="ital">raiment</span> was of camel’s hair and a leathern girdle about his loins’, it seems better to accept the expression as a description of Elijah’s dress. We know too that the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he has prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:">Zechariah 13:4</a>) did wear a mantle of hair, probably adopted from the garb of this greatest among them, Elijah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">It</span> is <span class="ital">Elijah the Tishbite</span>] Though the messengers might not know the prophet, the king, from his father’s experience, must have heard a great deal about Elijah, and of his appearance and dress.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A hairy man</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">lord</span> <span class="accented">of hair</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>). Some take the meaning to be that he was rough and unkempt, with his hair and beard long; and so the LXX., who give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>. But the more usual explanation is that he wore a shaggy coat of untanned skin, with the hair outward. Such a garment seems certainly to have been worn by the later prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and to have been regarded as a sign of their profession. But there is no positive evidence that the dress had been adopted by Isaiah's time. <span class="cmt_word">Girt with a girdle of leather.</span> Generally the Israelites wore girdles of a soft material, as linen or cotton. The "curious girdle" of the high priest's ephod was of "fine twined linen," embroidered with gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-8.htm">Exodus 28:8</a>). Girdles of leather, rough and uncomfortable, would only be worn by the very poor and by the ascetic. Elijah may have adopted his rough and coarse costume, either to show contempt for things earthly, as Hengstenberg thinks; or as a penitential garb indicating sorrow for the sins of the people, as Keil supposes; or simple to chastise and subdue the flesh, as other ascetics. <span class="cmt_word">It is Elijah the Tishbite.</span> The description given is enough. The king has no longer any doubt. His suspicion is turned into certainty. There is no living person but Elijah who would at once have the boldness to prophesy the death of the king, and would wear such a costume as described. Elijah is, of course, his enemy, as he had been his father's "enemy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>), and will wish him ill, and prophesy accordingly, the wish being "father to the thought." It is not improbable that Elijah had withdrawn himself into obscurity on the accession of Ahaziah, or at any rate on his exhibition of strong idolatrous proclivities (Ewald), as he had done on more than one occasion from Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8-8</a>). Ahaziah may have been long wishing to arrest and imprison him, and now thought he saw his opportunity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ahaziah could not do anything to subjugate the Moabites any further, since he was very soon afterwards taken grievously ill. He fell through the grating in his upper room at Samaria. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492;, the grating, is either a window furnished with a shutter of lattice-work, or a door of lattice-work in the upper room of the palace, but hardly a grating in the floor of the Aliyah for the purpose of letting light into the lower rooms, as the Rabbins supposed. On account of this misfortune, Ahaziah resorted to the Ekronitish Baalzebub to obtain an oracle concerning the result of his illness. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, i.e., Fly-Baal, was not merely the "averter of swarms of insects," like the &#x396;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of Elis (Ges., Winer, Movers, Phniz. i. p. 175), since "the Fly-God cannot have received his name as the enemy of flies, like lucus a non lucendo," but was &#x39c;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (lxx, Joseph.), i.e., God represented as a fly, as a fly-idol, to which the name Myiodes, gnat-like, in Plin. h. n. xxix. 6, clearly points, and as a god of the sun and of summer must have stood in a similar relation to the flies to that of the oracle-god Apollo, who both sent diseases and took them away (vid., J. G. Mller, Art. Beelzebub in Herzog's Cycl. i. p. 768, and Stark, Gaza, pp. 260,261). The latter observes that "these (the flies), which are governed in their coming and going by all the conditions of the weather, are apparently endowed with prophetic power themselves." This explains the fact that a special power of prophecy was attributed to this god.<p>(Note: The later Jews altered the name Beelzebub into &#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;, i.e., probably lord of the (heavenly) dwelling, as a name given to the &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm">Matthew 10:25</a>, etc.); and the later Rabbins finally, by changing &#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; into &#1494;&#1489;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, made a fly-god into a dung-god, to express in the most intense form their abomination of idolatry (see Lightfoot, Horae hebr. et talm. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>, and my Bibl. Archol. i. pp. 440,441).)<p>Ekron, now Akir, the most northerly of the five Philistine capitals (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>).</body></html>
