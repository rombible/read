Elijah had said, <span class= "ital">ye are going</span>, in his question to the messengers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-3.htm" title="But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?">2Kings 1:3</a>).

And Elijah departed.">2Kings 1:4</a>.) Bähr is wrong in supposing the servants anxious to shift the prophet’s blame from themselves to their lord, or that Elijah had addressed them as accomplices in the king’s guilt. They had no choice but to obey the royal mandate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-6.htm" title="And they said to him, There came a man up to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.">2 Kings 1:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">There came a man up to meet us — </span>Elijah was a man of such a venerable presence, and spake to them with such authority, in the name of the Lord, that they were overawed thereby, and induced to obey him rather than the king.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 When Ahaziah rebelled against the Lord, Moab revolted from him. Sin weakens and impoverishes us. Man's revolt from God is often punished by the rebellion of those who owe subjection to him. Ahaziah fell through a lattice, or railing. Wherever we go, there is but a step between us and death. A man's house is his castle, but not to secure him against God's judgments. The whole creation, which groans under the burden of man's sin, will, at length, sink and break under the weight like this lattice. He is never safe that has God for his enemy. Those that will not inquire of the word of God for their comfort, shall hear it to their terror, whether they will or no.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore ... - As a punishment for this insult to Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the messengers turned back&#8212;They did not know the stranger; but his authoritative tone, commanding attitude, and affecting message determined them at once to return.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they said unto him, there came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, go, turn again unto the king that sent you,....

So in A.V. in the next verse. It would appear as though the prophet had met the messengers very early in their journey while they were going down from the hill on which Samaria was built. They did not know Elijah, for he, like John the Baptist afterwards, was not one of those who were to be found in kings’ houses. And the messengers were most likely some of the persons in close attendance on the king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Go, turn again &c.</span>] These words are not in verse 3, but they are natural as a preface to the message there given.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that <span class="ital">thou sendest</span>] Elijah speaking to the messengers (verse 3) said naturally ‘that ye go’, but they put the words into a form suitable to their position as servants obeying an order. Yet we can see from some parts of the narrative which follows that some of the king’s servants were willing enough to follow where he led them.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There came a man.</span> It is not likely that the messengers did not know Elijah by sight. He was too prominent a person in the history of the time, and too remarkable in his appearance, not to have been recognized, at any rate by some of them. But they thought it best to keep back the prophet's name, and to call him simply "a man" (<span class="accented">ish</span>) - perhaps actuated by good will towards Elijah, perhaps by a fear for their own safety, such as had been felt by Obadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-8.htm">1 Kings 18:8-14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/1_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ahaziah walked in the way of his father and his mother, who had introduced the worship of Baal into the kingdom, and in the way of Jeroboam, who had set up the calves (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-53.htm">1 Kings 22:53</a> it is again expressly added, that he adored and worshipped Baal, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>. - With this general description of his character not only is the chapter brought to a close, but the first book of Kings also, - very unsuitably, however, since the further account of Ahaziah's reign and of his death is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1.htm">2 Kings 1</a> of the following book. It would have been incomparably more suitable to commence a fresh chapter with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>, and indeed to commence the second book there also.</body></html>
