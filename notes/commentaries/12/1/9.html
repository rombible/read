But how inconsistent was the king’s conduct on this occasion. “Did he think Elijah a prophet,” says Henry, “a true prophet? Why then did he dare to persecute him? Did he think him a common person? What need then was there of such a force to seize him?” <span class="ital">Behold, he sat on the top of a hill — </span>Elijah was now so far from absconding, as formerly, in the close recesses of a cave, that he makes a bold appearance on an elevated place.

Elijah did this by a Divine impulse, yet our Saviour would not allow the disciples to do the like, Lu 9:54. The dispensation of the Spirit and of grace by no means allowed it. Elijah was concerned for God's glory, those for their own reputation. The Lord judges men's practices by their principles, and his judgment is according to truth. The third captain humbled himself, and cast himself upon the mercy of God and Elijah. There is nothing to be got by contending with God; and those are wise for themselves, who learn submission from the fatal end of obstinacy in others. The courage of faith has often struck terror into the heart of the proudest sinner. So thunderstruck is Ahaziah with the prophet's words, that neither he, nor any about him, offer him violence. Who can harm those whom God shelters? Many who think to prosper in sin, are called hence like Ahaziah, when they do not expect it. All warns us to seek the Lord while he may be found.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the king sent unto him - i. e., in order to seize and punish him.

Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty&#8212;Any appearance of cruelty that there is in the fate of the two captains and their men will be removed, on a full consideration of the circumstances. God being the King of Israel, Ahaziah was bound to govern the kingdom according to the divine law; to apprehend the Lord's prophet, for discharging a commanded duty, was that of an impious and notorious rebel. The captains abetted the king in his rebellion; and they exceeded their military duty by contemptuous insults.<p>man of God&#8212;In using this term, they either spoke derisively, believing him to be no true prophet; or, if they regarded him as a true prophet, the summons to him to surrender himself bound to the king was a still more flagrant insult; the language of the second captain being worse than that of the first.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou man of God; </span> so he calls him in way of scorn and contempt: q.d.

It may be, however, that in the brevity of the narrative we are not told of Elijah’s movements, and that he had already retired to some centre of the prophetic body; and if so, the king may have apprehended that resistance would be offered to his arrest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a captain of fifty</span>] One of the subdivisions of the Jewish army was into ‘fifties’. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-12.htm" title="And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.">1 Samuel 8:12</a>. Greater bodies were ‘hundreds’ and ‘thousands’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-14.htm" title="And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.">Numbers 31:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he sat on the top of a</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">the</span>] <span class="ital">hill</span>] The word rendered ‘sat’ may also be translated ‘dwelt’ (see marg. of R.V.) and the definite article indicates that some particular hill is intended, therefore the suggestion that Elijah had already withdrawn to Carmel, and that the soldiers followed him thither, is most likely correct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Thou</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">O</span>] <span class="ital">man of God</span>] The original is precisely as in verse 13. But in the two first addresses the title was given no doubt in mockery. In the mouth of one who really felt the force of the words there could have followed them no such sentence as ‘the king hath said, Come down’. For a contrast see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm" title="And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?">1 Kings 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.">1 Kings 17:24</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king sent unto him a captain of fifty.</span> "Captains of fifties" were first instituted in the wilderness by the advice of Jethro (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-25</a>). Though not expressly mentioned in the military organization of David, they probably formed a part of it, and so passed into the institutions of the kingdom of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">With his fifty.</span> Some recognition of Elijah's superhuman power would seem to have led Ahaziah to send so large a body. His doing so was a sort of challenge to the prophet to show whether Ahaziah or the God whom he represented was the stronger. The circumstances recall those of the "band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>), which was sent, "with swords and staves," to arrest another righteous Person. <span class="cmt_word">He sat on the top of a hill</span>; literally, on <span class="accented">the top of the hill</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). The high ground where Elijah had met the messengers (ver. 3) seems to be intended. When they were gone, the prophet took his seat on the highest point, conspicuous on all sides, so avoiding any attempt at concealment, and awaiting the next step that the king would take, calmly and quietly. <span class="cmt_word">He spake unto him; Thou man of God.</span> The captain is thought by some to have spoken ironically; but there is no evidence of this. The address is respectful, submissive. The miraculous powers of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) were probably known to the officer, who hoped by the tone of his address to escape the prophet's anger. In the same spirit he avoids issuing any command of his own, and prefers simply to deliver the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">The king hath said, Come down.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the angel of the Lord, the mediator of the revelations made by the invisible God to the covenant nation (see Comm. on the Pentateuch, vol. i. pp. 185-191, transl.), had spoken to Elijah to go and meet the king's messengers, who were going to inquire of Baalzebub, and to ask them whether it was from the want of a God in Israel (&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11</a>; see Ewald, 323, a.) that they turned to Baalzebub, and to announce to them the word of Jehovah, that Ahaziah would not rise up from his bed again, but would die.
