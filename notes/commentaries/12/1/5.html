Sin weakens and impoverishes us. Man's revolt from God is often punished by the rebellion of those who owe subjection to him. Ahaziah fell through a lattice, or railing. Wherever we go, there is but a step between us and death. A man's house is his castle, but not to secure him against God's judgments. The whole creation, which groans under the burden of man's sin, will, at length, sink and break under the weight like this lattice. He is never safe that has God for his enemy. Those that will not inquire of the word of God for their comfort, shall hear it to their terror, whether they will or no.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore ... - As a punishment for this insult to Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the messengers turned back&#8212;They did not know the stranger; but his authoritative tone, commanding attitude, and affecting message determined them at once to return.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Before you have been at Ekron; which he easily knew by their quick return. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the messengers turned back unto him,....
