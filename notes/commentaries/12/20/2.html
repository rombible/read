When we cannot be so private as we would in our devotions, nor perform them with the usual outward expressions of reverence and solemnity, yet we must not, therefore, omit them, but compose and address ourselves to them as well as we can.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Hezekiah was sick unto death, in the same year in which the king of Assyria besieged Jerusalem. A warning to prepare for death was brought to Hezekiah by Isaiah. Prayer is one of the best preparations for death, because by it we fetch in strength and grace from God, to enable us to finish well. He wept sorely: some gather from hence that he was unwilling to die; it is in the nature of man to dread the separation of soul and body. There was also something peculiar in Hezekiah's case; he was now in the midst of his usefulness. Let Hezekiah's prayer, see Isa 38. interpret his tears; in that is nothing which is like his having been under that fear of death, which has bondage or torment. Hezekiah's piety made his sick-bed easy. O Lord, remember now; he does not speak as if God needed to be put in mind of any thing by us; nor, as if the reward might be demanded as due; it is Christ's righteousness only that is the purchase of mercy and grace. Hezekiah does not pray, Lord, spare me; but, Lord, remember me; whether I live or die, let me be thine. God always hears the prayers of the broken in heart, and will give health, length of days, and temporal deliverances, as much and as long as is truly good for them. Means were to be used for Hezekiah's recovery; yet, considering to what a height the disease was come, and how suddenly it was checked, the cure was miraculous. It is our duty, when sick, to use such means as are proper to help nature, else we do not trust God, but tempt him. For the confirmation of his faith, the shadow of the sun was carried back, and the light was continued longer than usual, in a miraculous manner. This work of wonder shows the power of God in heaven as well as on earth, the great notice he takes of prayer, and the great favour he bears to his chosen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He turned his face to the wall - Contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>.

Ahab did the like, but it was in childish petulance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-4.htm" title="And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.

If Manasseh was the eldest son of Hezekiah, the king was at this time childless, for Manasseh was but twelve years old at his father’s death. Hence not only his own life, but the succession of the house of David appeared likely to come to an end.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he turned his face to the wall</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span>, away from those who were standing beside his bed, and might have distracted his attention, to pray with more concentration and earnestness - <span class="cmt_word">and prayed unto the Lord, saying</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>)<span class="cmt_word">.</span> It was natural to Hezekiah, in every kind of affliction and distress, to take his trouble direct to God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sign is followed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-30.htm">2 Kings 19:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-31.htm">2 Kings 19:31</a> by the distinct promise of the deliverance of Judah and Jerusalem, for which Isaiah uses the sign itself as a type. "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again strike roots downwards and bear fruit upwards; for from Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and that which is escaped from Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah will do this." &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1505;&#1507;, to add roots, i.e., to strike fresh roots. The meaning is, that Judah will not succumb to this judgment. The remnant of the nation that has escaped from destruction by the Assyrians will once more grow and flourish vigorously; for from Jerusalem will a rescued remnant go forth. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; denotes those who have escaped destruction by the judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.). The deliverance was attached to Jerusalem or to Mount Zion, not so much because the power of the Assyrians was to be destroyed before the gates of Jerusalem, as because of the greater importance which Jerusalem and Mount Zion, as the centre of the kingdom of God, the seat of the God-King, possessed in relation to the covenant-nation, so that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, it was thence that the Messianic salvation was also to proceed. This deliverance is traced to the zeal of the Lord on behalf of His people and against His foes (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), like the coming of the Messiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> to establish an everlasting kingdom of peace and righteousness. The deliverance of Judah out of the power of Asshur was a prelude and type of the deliverance of the people of God by the Messiah out of the power of all that was ungodly. The &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; of Isaiah is omitted after &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>; though here it is supplied by the Masora as Keri. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-34</a> Isaiah concludes by announcing that Sennacherib will not come to Jerusalem, nor even shoot at the city and besiege it, but will return disappointed, because the Lord will defend and save the city for the sake of His promise. The result of the whole prophecy is introduced with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;: therefore, because this is how the matter stands, viz., as explained in what precedes. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, with regard to the king, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20</a>. &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, "he will not attack it with a shield," i.e., will not advance with shields to make an attack upon it. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; with a double accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>. It only occurs here in a hostile sense: to come against, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>, i.e., to advance against a city, to storm it. The four clauses of the verse stand in a graduated relation to one another: not to take, not even to shoot at and attack, yea, not even to besiege the city, will he come. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> we have <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a> taken up again, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a> is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> for the purpose of strengthening the promise. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; we have in Isaiah &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;: "by which he has come." The perfect is actually more exact, and the imperfect may be explained from the fact that Sennacherib was at that very time advancing against Jerusalem. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-34.htm">2 Kings 19:34</a> we have &#1488;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; instead of the &#1506;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; of Isaiah: &#1506;&#1500; is more correct than &#1488;&#1500;. "For my sake," as Hezekiah had prayed in v. 19; and "for my servant David's sake," because Jehovah, as the unchangeably true One, must fulfil the promise which He gave to David (sees at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). </body></html>
