A warning to prepare for death was brought to Hezekiah by Isaiah. Prayer is one of the best preparations for death, because by it we fetch in strength and grace from God, to enable us to finish well. He wept sorely: some gather from hence that he was unwilling to die; it is in the nature of man to dread the separation of soul and body. There was also something peculiar in Hezekiah's case; he was now in the midst of his usefulness. Let Hezekiah's prayer, see Isa 38. interpret his tears; in that is nothing which is like his having been under that fear of death, which has bondage or torment. Hezekiah's piety made his sick-bed easy. O Lord, remember now; he does not speak as if God needed to be put in mind of any thing by us; nor, as if the reward might be demanded as due; it is Christ's righteousness only that is the purchase of mercy and grace. Hezekiah does not pray, Lord, spare me; but, Lord, remember me; whether I live or die, let me be thine. God always hears the prayers of the broken in heart, and will give health, length of days, and temporal deliverances, as much and as long as is truly good for them. Means were to be used for Hezekiah's recovery; yet, considering to what a height the disease was come, and how suddenly it was checked, the cure was miraculous. It is our duty, when sick, to use such means as are proper to help nature, else we do not trust God, but tempt him. For the confirmation of his faith, the shadow of the sun was carried back, and the light was continued longer than usual, in a miraculous manner. This work of wonder shows the power of God in heaven as well as on earth, the great notice he takes of prayer, and the great favour he bears to his chosen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king of Assyria in 714 and 713 B.C. was Sargon (B.C. 721-705). If then the Biblical and Assyrian chronologies which agree exactly in the year of the taking of Samaria (721 B.C.), are to be depended on, the king of Assyria here must have been Sargon. It may be conjectured that he had taken offence at something in the conduct of Hezekiah, and have threatened Jerusalem about this time (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>). There is, however, no evidence of actual hostilities between Judaea and Assyria in Sargon's reign. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The disease cannot be ascertained; but the text gives no hint that the plague was raging then in Jerusalem; and although Arab physicians apply a cataplasm of figs to plague-boils, they also do so in other cases, as figs are considered useful in ripening and soothing inflammatory ulcers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Fifteen years</span> beyond what thou dost expect, and beyond what thou wouldst do if I should leave thee to the force of thy disease. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of the hand of the king of Assyria; </span> this is added, either, first, Because he might otherwise fear the Assyrian’s return to this city, from which he was so shamefully repulsed.

When he was worshipping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer slew him, and fled into the land of Ararat, and his son Esarhaddon became king in his stead. With regard to &#1504;&#1505;&#1512;&#1498;, Nisroch, all that seems to be firmly established is that he was an eagle-deity, and represented by the eagle-or vulture-headed human figure with wings, which is frequently depicted upon the Assyrian monuments, "not only in colossal proportions upon the walls and watching the portals of the rooms, but also constantly in the groups upon the embroidered robes. When it is introduced in this way, we see it constantly fighting with other mythical animals, such as human-headed oxen or lions; and in these conflicts it always appears to be victorious," from which we may infer that it was a type of the supreme deity (see Layard's Nineveh and its Remains). The eagle was worshipped as a god by the Arabs (Pococke, Specim. pp. 94, 199), was regarded as sacred to Melkarth by the Phoenicians (Nonnus, Dionys. xl. 495,528), and, according to a statement of Philo. Bybl. (in Euseb. Praepar. evang. i. 10), that Zoroaster taught that the supreme deity was represented with an eagle's head, it was also a symbol of Ormuzd among the Persians; consequently Movers (Phniz. i. pp. 68, 506, 507) regards Nisroch as the supreme deity of the Assyrians. It is not improbable that it was also connected with the constellation of the eagle (see Ideler, Ursprung der Sternnamen, p. 416). On the other hand, the current interpretation of the name from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, Chald.; nsr, Arab.), eagle, vulture, with the Persian adjective termination ok or ach, is very doubtful, not merely on account of the &#1505; in &#1504;&#1505;&#1512;&#1498;, but chiefly because this name does not occur in Assyrian, but simply Asar, Assar, and Asarak as the name of a deity which is met with in many Assyrian proper names. The last is also adopted by the lxx, who (ed. Aldin. Compl.) have rendered &#1504;&#1505;&#1512;&#1498; by &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7; in Isaiah, and &#x395;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7; (cod. Vatic.) in 2 Kings, by the side of which the various readings &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7; in our text (cod. Vat.) and &#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7; in Isaiah are evidently secondary readings emended from the Hebrew, since Josephus (Ant. x. 1, 5) has the form &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, which is merely somewhat "Graecized." The meaning of these names is still in obscurity, even if there should be some foundation for the assumption that Assar belongs to the same root as the name of the people and land, Asshur. The connection between the form Nisroch and Asarak is also still obscure. Compare the collection which J. G. Mller has made of the different conjectures concerning this deity in the Art. Nisroch in Herzog's Cycl. - Adrammelech, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-31.htm">2 Kings 17:31</a>, was the name of a deity of Sepharvaim, which was here borne by the king's son. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1488;&#1510;&#1512;, Sharezer, is said to mean "prince of fire," and was probably also borrowed from a deity. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (Isa.) is wanting in our text, but is supplied by the Masora in the Keri. The "land of Ararat" was a portion of the high land of Armenia; according to Moses v. Chorene, the central portion of it with the mountains of the same name (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>). The slaying of Sennacherib is also confirmed by Alex. Polyhistor, or rather Berosus (in Euseb. Chr. Armen. i. p. 43), who simply names, however, a son Ardumusanus as having committed the murder, and merely mentions a second Asordanius as viceroy of Babylon.<p>(Note: With regard to the statement of Abydenus in Euseb. l. c. p. 53, that Sennacherib was followed by Nergilus, who was slain by his son Adrameles, who again was murdered by his brother Axerdis, and its connection with Berosus and the biblical account, see M. v. Niebuhr, Geschichte Assurs, pp. 361ff. Nergilus is probably the same person as Sharezer, and Axerdis as Esarhaddon.)<p>The identity of the latter with Esarhaddon is beyond all doubt. The name &#1488;&#1505;&#1512;&#1470;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503;, Esar-cha-don, consisting of two parts with the guttural inserted, the usual termination in Assyrian and Babylonian, Assar-ach, is spelt &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; in the lxx, &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; in Tobit - probably formed from &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;-&#x3c7;-&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1; by a transposition of the letters, - by Josephus &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, by Berosus (in the armen. Euseb.) Asordanes, by Abyden. ibid. Axerdis, in the Canon Ptol. &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and lastly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a> mutilated into &#1488;&#1505;&#1504;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, Osnappar (Chald.), and in the lxx &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;; upon the Assyrian monuments, according to Oppert, Assur-akh-iddin (cf. M. v. Niebuhr, Gesch. Ass. p. 38). The length of his reign is uncertain. The statements of Berosus, that he was first of all viceroy of Babylon, and then for eight years king of Assyria, and that of the Canon Ptol., that he reigned for thirteen years in Babylon, are decidedly incorrect. Brandis (Rerum Assyr. tempora emend. p. 41) conjectures that he reigned twenty-eight years, but in his work Ueber den histor. Gewinn, pp. 73, 74, he suggests seventeen years. M. v. Niebuhr (ut sup. p. 77), on the other hand, reckons his reign at twenty-four years. </body></html>
