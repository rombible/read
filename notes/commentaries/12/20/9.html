But Hezekiah’s answer apparently implies an alternative; and we <span class= "ital">might</span> render: “the shadow shall have travelled ten steps; or shall it return ten steps?” (Comp. the LXX. <span class= "greekheb">πορεύσεται</span><span class= "ital">.</span>) The Targum has: “shall the shadow march ten hours or return ten hours?” The Vulgate also makes it a double question. The Syriac is: “the shadow shall march ten steps, or return ten steps.”<p>It is very probable that the Hebrew text is corrupt. We might read the first word as an infinitive instead of a perfect, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-29.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.">2Kings 19:29</a> (“ye shall eat”). Or we might read “shall it march?” as a question (<span class= "ital">hă-yēlēk</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> or better still, “shall it go up” (<span class= "ital">hă-yēlēk</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> after the hint afforded by the Vulgate: “Vis ut <span class= "ital">ascendat</span> umbra . . . Et ait Ezeehias, Facile est umbram <span class= "ital">crescere,</span>” &c. It is obvious that a kind of sun-dial is meant, though what kind is not so clear. The word “degrees” (<span class= "ital">ma‘ălôth</span>) means “steps” or “stairs” wherever it occurs. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-26.htm" title="Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not discovered thereon.">Exodus 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm" title="Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.">Ezekiel 40:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm" title="And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.">Ezekiel 40:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm" title="And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on the posts thereof.">Ezekiel 40:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-31.htm" title="And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:31</a>, &c; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-20.htm" title="And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.">1Kings 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm" title="But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and to the stairs that go down from the city of David.">Nehemiah 3:15</a>.) There is probability, therefore, in Knobel’s conjecture that “the dial of Ahaz” consisted of a column rising from a circular flight of steps, so as to throw the shadow of its top on the top step at noon, and morning and evening on the bottom step. This, or some similar device, was set up in the palace court, and was probably visible to Hezekiah lying on his sick bed and facing the window. Herodotus (ii. 9) ascribes the invention of the gnomon to the Babylonians. From the inscriptions we know that they divided time into periods of two hours, each called in Sumerian <span class= "ital">kasbumi,</span> and in Assyrian <span class= "ital">asli.</span> Each <span class= "ital">kasbu</span> or <span class= "ital">aslu</span> was subdivided into sixty equal parts.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Hezekiah was sick unto death, in the same year in which the king of Assyria besieged Jerusalem. A warning to prepare for death was brought to Hezekiah by Isaiah. Prayer is one of the best preparations for death, because by it we fetch in strength and grace from God, to enable us to finish well. He wept sorely: some gather from hence that he was unwilling to die; it is in the nature of man to dread the separation of soul and body. There was also something peculiar in Hezekiah's case; he was now in the midst of his usefulness. Let Hezekiah's prayer, see Isa 38. interpret his tears; in that is nothing which is like his having been under that fear of death, which has bondage or torment. Hezekiah's piety made his sick-bed easy. O Lord, remember now; he does not speak as if God needed to be put in mind of any thing by us; nor, as if the reward might be demanded as due; it is Christ's righteousness only that is the purchase of mercy and grace. Hezekiah does not pray, Lord, spare me; but, Lord, remember me; whether I live or die, let me be thine. God always hears the prayers of the broken in heart, and will give health, length of days, and temporal deliverances, as much and as long as is truly good for them. Means were to be used for Hezekiah's recovery; yet, considering to what a height the disease was come, and how suddenly it was checked, the cure was miraculous. It is our duty, when sick, to use such means as are proper to help nature, else we do not trust God, but tempt him. For the confirmation of his faith, the shadow of the sun was carried back, and the light was continued longer than usual, in a miraculous manner. This work of wonder shows the power of God in heaven as well as on earth, the great notice he takes of prayer, and the great favour he bears to his chosen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ten degrees - literally, "ten steps." It is not, perhaps, altogether certain whether the "dial of Ahaz" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-11.htm">2 Kings 20:11</a> was really a dial with a gnomon in the center, and "degrees" marked round it, or a construction fur marking time by means of "steps." Sundials proper had been invented by the Babylonians before the time of Herodotus; but the instrument here was probably an instrument consisting of a set of steps, or stairs, with an obelisk at the top, the shadow of which descended or ascended the steps according as the sun rose higher in the heavens or declined.<p>The question as to the mode whereby the return of the shadow was produced is one on which many opinions have been held. Recently, it has been urged that the true cause of the phenomenon was a solar eclipse, in which the moon obscured the entire upper limb of the sun; and it has been clearly shown that if such an occurrence took place a little before mid-day, it would have had the effect described as having taken place - i. e., during the obscuration of the sun's upper limb shadows would be sensibly lengthened, and that of the obelisk would descend the stairs; as the obscuration passed off the reverse would take place, shadows would shorten, and that of the obelisk would once more retire up the steps. If this be the true account, the miracle would consist in Isaiah's supernatural foreknowledge of an event which the astronomy of the age was quite incapable of predicting, and in the providential guidance of Hezekiah's will, so that he chose the "sign" which in the natural course of things was about to be manifested. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 20:8-20. The Sun Goes Ten Degrees Backward.<p>8-11. Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What will be the sign that the Lord shall heal me&#8212;His recovery in the course of nature was so unlooked for, that the king asked for some token to justify his reliance on the truth of the prophet's communication; and the sign he specified was granted to him. The shadow of the sun went back upon the dial of Ahaz the ten degrees it had gone down. Various conjectures have been formed as to this dial. The word in the original is "degrees," or "steps," and hence many commentators have supposed that it was a stair, so artfully contrived, that the shadows on the steps indicated the hours and course of the sun. But it is more probable that it was a proper instrument, and, from the Hebrews having no term to designate it, that it was one of the foreign novelties imported from Babylon by Ahaz. It seems to have been of such magnitude, and so placed in the court, that Isaiah could point to it, and the king see it, from his chamber. The retrogression of the sun's shadow on the dial was miraculously accomplished by the omnipotent power of God; but the phenomenon was temporary, local, confined to the notice, and intended for the satisfaction, only of Hezekiah and his court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Isaiah said, this sign shalt thou have of the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken,....

In the Hebrew there is no sign of interrogation in the first clause. But instances are not rare in which the interrogative sign is left out (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-4.htm" title="And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Come you peaceably?">1 Samuel 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-29.htm" title="And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.">2 Samuel 18:29</a>). A greater difficulty is in the tense of the first verb. The clause, if it stood alone, would be translated, ‘The shadow hath gone forward ten steps, (what) if it shall go back ten steps? But Hezekiah’s answer implies that an alternative question was asked. Thus both A.V. and R.V. have translated it, but how the grammar is to be made to yield a double question is not easy to see. For if the omitted interrogation be supplied, we have still only, ‘Hath the shadow gone forward ten steps?’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken.</span> Hezekiah is no more reproved for asking for a sign than was Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37, 39</a>). Ahaz, his father, had been reproved for not asking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-13.htm">Isaiah 7:13</a>). It would be faithless now for Christians to demand signs; but in an age of miracles, when there were prophets upon the earth empowered to give signs, faithful men might request them without incurring God's displeasure. <span class="cmt_word">Shall the shadow go forward ten degrees?</span> The Hebrew text will scarcely bear this translation, which, however, seems to be required by Hezekiah's answer. Perhaps for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5da;</span>. Or go back ten degrees? literally, in both clauses, <span class="accented">ten steps</span>. There are abundant reasons for believing that the early dials consisted of a gnomon set up on the top of a flight of steps, and that time was measured by the number of steps on which the shadow of the gnomon fell (see a paper by Mr. Bosanquet, in the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1874, pp. 1-82). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In his prayer he appealed to his walking before the Lord in truth and with a thoroughly devoted heart, and to his acting in a manner that was well-pleasing to God, in perfect accordance with the legal standpoint of the Old Testament, which demanded of the godly righteousness of life according to the law. This did not imply by any means a self-righteous trust in his own virtue; for walking before God with a thoroughly devoted heart was impossible without faith. "And Hezekiah wept violently," not merely at the fact that he was to die without having an heir to the throne, since Manasseh was not born till three years afterwards (Joseph., Ephr. Syr., etc.), but also because he was to die in the very midst of his life, since God had promised long life to the righteous.</body></html>
