Schrader regards this as an indication that Hezekiah’s illness and the embassy of Merodach-baladan belong to the time preceding Sennacherib’s invasion. Thenius, however, supposes that Hezekiah simply gave all the <span class= "ital">money</span> in his treasury to Sennacherib’s envoys, and stripped off the gold plating of the Temple before them that they might suppose his resources exhausted, when, in fact, he had not touched his real treasures, which were concealed in subterranean chambers.

So hard a matter it is even for a good man to be high and humble. Although no particular mention is made of Hezekiah’s showing these strangers the temple, yet, as it was by far the most sumptuous and splendid building in Jerusalem, and the greatest curiosity in his dominions, there can be no doubt but it was shown them, as far as it was permitted to heathen, who were not proselytes to the Jewish religion, to see it; but whether he took any pains to make them acquainted with the great Being who was worshipped there, and who, by his almighty power, had wrought the miracles which had excited their attention, or with his laws, and the ordinances of his service, may well be doubted. Although, certainly, he had a very fair opportunity of doing this, and of demonstrating to them the unreasonableness and folly of idolatry in all its branches, and especially of their worship of the sun, which the late miracle had shown to be no more than the creature and servant of the God of Israel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:12-21 The king of Babylon was at this time independent of the king of Assyria, though shortly after subdued by him. Hezekiah showed his treasures and armour, and other proofs of his wealth and power. This was the effect of pride and ostentation, and departing from simple reliance on God. He also seems to have missed the opportunity of speaking to the Chaldeans, about Him who had wrought the miracles which excited their attention, and of pointing out to them the absurdity and evil of idolatry. What is more common than to show our friends our houses and possessions? But if we do this in the pride of ours hearts, to gain applause from men, not giving praise to God, it becomes sin in us, as it did in Hezekiah. We may expect vexation from every object with which we are unduly pleased. Isaiah, who had often been Hezekiah's comforter, is now is reprover. The blessed Spirit is both, Joh 16:7,8. Ministers must be both, as there is occasion. Hezekiah allowed the justice of the sentence, and God's goodness in the respite. Yet the prospect respecting his family and nation must have given him many painful feelings. Hezekiah was indeed humbled for the pride of his heart. And blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; for they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them - The Jewish king lent a favorable ear to the proposals of the ambassadors, and exhibited to them the resources which he possessed, in order to induce them to report well of him to their master.<p>All the house of his precious things - literally, the "spice-house;" the phrase had acquired the more generic sense of "treasure-house" from the fact that the gold, the silver, and the spices were all stored together. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14. the silver, and the gold&#8212;He paid so much tribute to Sennacherib as exhausted his treasury (compare 2Ki 18:16).

The vain display, however, was offensive to his divine liege lord, who sent Isaiah to reprove him. The answer he gave the prophet (2Ki 22:14) shows how he was elated by the compliment of their visit; but it was wrong, as presenting a bait for the cupidity of these rapacious foreigners, who, at no distant period, would return and pillage his country, and transfer all the possessions he ostentatiously displayed to Babylon, as well as his posterity to be court attendants in that country&#8212;(see on [349]2Ch 32:31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hearkened unto them, </span> i.e. granted their desires of a league and amity with them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The silver and the gold, </span>& c.; for though his country had lately been harassed by the Assyrians, yet he had reserved all his treasures and precious things which he and his fathers had gathered in Jerusalem.

The LXX. gives <span class="greekheb">ἐχάρη</span>, he rejoiced, in this passage. The difference in the Hebrew words is very slight. Here we have <span class="greekheb">ישמצ</span>, in Isaiah <span class="greekheb">ישמח</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and shewed them all the house of his precious things</span>] On the margin both A.V. and R.V. give ‘spicery’ instead of ‘precious things’; and the word (with a very slight difference of form) is used in that sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>. But here as the house seems to have contained the various things which follow after, silver and gold as well as spices, perhaps the more general rendering is to be preferred. The storehouse which at first had its name from the aromatic treasures bestowed there, came in time to be used, without change of name, for the keeping of other things that were valuable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">precious ointment</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">oil</span>. This is the more usual rendering.

Hence the Massoretes have put it as a various reading on the margin of this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The house of armour was no doubt ‘the house of the forest of Lebanon’, which Solomon built as an armoury, see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm" title="He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.">1 Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm" title="And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.">1 Kings 10:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">nothing … that Hezekiah shewed them not</span>] He was clearly desirous to produce an impression of his wealth and consequent power.

It was a grand thing that his fame should have reached so far as Babylon, a still grander thing to be offered such an alliance. It must be remembered that he and his counselors were inclined from the first to meet Assyrian menace by calling in foreign aid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>). He had not yet accepted the view of Isaiah, that human aid was vain, and that the only reasonable ground of hope or confidence was, in Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And showed them all the house of his precious things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his treasury. Hezekiah did not do this in mere ostentation, though he may have had a certain pride in exhibiting his wealth. His main wish, no doubt, was to make known his resources, and show that he was a valuable ally. So Oroetes acted towards Polycrates (Herod., 3:123), and Hannibal towards the Gortynians (Com. Nep., 'Vit. Hannib.,' &sect; 9). It is to be borne in mind that Hezekiah's treasures were, in  <span class="date">B.C. 712</span>, still intact, and included all that ample store which he sacrificed to save Jerusalem at the time of the first expedition of Sennacherib (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>, and comp. 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, where we find enumerated among the treasures given up, besides gold and silver, "precious carbuncles, couches of ivory, elevated thrones of ivory, skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, and weapons"). <span class="cmt_word">The silver, and the gold, and the spices.</span> Compare the description of the wealth of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). "Spices" always form an important portion of the treasure of Oriental kings (comp. Herod., 2. 97, sub fin.). <span class="cmt_word">And the precious ointment</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the precious oil -</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (compare the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>).

It would be almost as important to show that he had abundant arms in store, as that he had abundant riches. <span class="cmt_word">And all that was found in his treasures</span> - a clause implying that there was much more which had not been specified, as precious stones, ivory, ebony, and the like - <span class="cmt_word">there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.</span> This is a manifest hyperbole; but it can scarcely mean less than that he gave orders for them to be shown the collections of arms and stores which existed in his other strongholds besides Jerusalem. Hezekiah, no doubt, had many "<span class="accented">store</span> cities," as Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-6.htm">2 Chronicles 8:6</a>) and Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12</a>) had. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Isaiah ordered a lump of figs to be laid upon the boil, and Hezekiah recovered (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;: he revived again). It is of course assumed as self-evident, that Isaiah returned to the king in consequence of a divine revelation, and communicated to him the word of the Lord which he had received.<p>(Note: The account is still more abridged in the text of Isaiah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a> the precise time of the prayer is omitted; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-5.htm">2 Kings 20:5</a> the words, "behold, I will cure thee, on the third day thou shalt go into the house of the Lord;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-6.htm">2 Kings 20:6</a> the words, "for mine own sake and my servant David's sake."

In the case of Hezekiah it is probably a carbuncle that is intended.<p>After the allusion to the cure and recovery of Hezekiah, we have an account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8</a>. of the sign by which Isaiah confirmed the promise given to the king of the prolongation of his life. In the order of time the contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-7.htm">2 Kings 20:7</a> follow <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-11.htm">2 Kings 20:11</a>, since the prophet in all probability first of all disclosed the divine promise to the king, and then gave him the sign, and after that appointed the remedy and had it applied. At the same time, it is also quite possible that he first of all directed the lump of figs to be laid upon the boil, and then made known to him the divine promise, and guaranteed it by the sign. In this case &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; merely anticipates the order of events. The sign which Isaiah gave to the king, at his request, consisted in the miraculous movement of the shadow backward upon the sundial of Ahaz.</body></html>
