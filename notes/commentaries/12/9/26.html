As to the fact, it would be quite in accordance with ancient practice to slay the sons of one accused of blasphemy along with their father (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/7-24.htm" title="And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.">Joshua 7:24-25</a>); and the crafty Jezebel would not be likely to spare persons whose wrongs might one day prove dangerous. The difference in the two narratives is accounted for by the circumstance that the present is the <span class= "ital">exact version</span> of an eye-witness, viz., Jehu himself, while the former was probably derived from a less direct source.<p><span class= "bld">Saith the Lord.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">is the thing uttered of Jehovah.</span> This phrase, which is uncommon except in the writings of the prophets, and the word rendered “burden” in the last verse, which also belongs to prophetic terminology, together establish the historical authenticity of the short oracle of Elijah, recorded in this verse. Its brevity and the solemnity with which it was pronounced would, we may be sure, stamp it ineffaceably upon the memory of those who heard it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-30.htm" title="Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.">1Samuel 2:30</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-33.htm" title="By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, said the LORD.">2Kings 19:33</a>, <span class= "ital">infra</span>.)<p><span class= "bld">I will requite thee in this plat.</span>—Another important detail not given in the former account.<p><span class= "bld">Plat.</span>—<span class= "ital">Portion,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25</a> (twice).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm" title="Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD.

Some however, are of opinion, as we have no account in the history of Naboth, (1 Kings 21.,) that his sons were killed with him, that Jehu does not here repeat the exact words of God by Elijah, but exaggerates the matter, and represents the sons as slain with their father, because, by their being deprived of him and of his estate, they were, in a manner, in as bad a condition as though they had been destroyed. <span class="ital">I will requite thee in this plat — </span>That very piece of ground, which Ahab, with so much pride and pleasure, had made himself master of, at the expense of the guilt of innocent blood, now became the theatre on which his son’s dead body lay unburied and exposed, a spectacle to the world, and a prey to the dogs or fowls, according to the prediction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm" title="And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession?

The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin.
