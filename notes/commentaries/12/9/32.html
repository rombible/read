Jehu knew that the imperious and cruel queen was well hated by the palace officials. The “two or three eunuchs,” who a moment before had crouched in servile dread before Jezebel, would now be eager to curry favour with the regicide, and, at the same time, wreak their malice upon their former tyrant. (The repetition, “Who is on my side? <span class= "ital">who?</span>” accords well with Jehu’s character. The LXX. has the strange reading, “he saw her, and said, Who art thou? Come down with me.” Josephus adopts this; but Thenius shows clearly that it has originated in easy corruptions of the present Hebrew text.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/9-32.htm" title="And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who?

It is remarkable, however, of Jezebel’s eunuchs, that they were far from being faithful to her; to let us see how suddenly courtiers are wont to change with the fortune of their masters.” <span class="ital">He said, Throw her down. So they threw her down — </span>Being mercenary creatures, they quickly comply with Jehu’s command, sacrificing her life to save their own. “Thus, as she had done, so she suffered.

See how a heart, hardened against God, will brave it out to the last. There is not a surer presage of ruin, than an unhumbled heart under humbling providences. Let those look at Jezebel's conduct and fate, who use arts to seduce others to commit wickedness, and to draw them aside from the ways of truth and righteousness. Jehu called for aid against Jezebel. When reformation-work is on foot, it is time to ask, Who sides with it? Her attendants delivered her up. Thus she was put to death. See the end of pride and cruelty, and say, The Lord is righteous. When we pamper our bodies, let us think how vile they are; shortly they will be a feast for worms under ground, or beasts above ground. May we all flee from that wrath which is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Painted her face - literally, "put her eyes in antimony " - i. e., dyed the upper and under eyelids, a common practice in the East, even at the present day.

Jezebel painted her face&#8212;literally, "her eyes," according to a custom universal in the East among women, of staining the eyelids with a black powder made of pulverized antimony, or lead ore mixed with oil, and applied with a small brush on the border, so that by this dark ligament on the edge, the largeness as well as the luster of the eye itself was thought to be increased. Her object was, by her royal attire, not to captivate, but to overawe Jehu.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For such used to attend upon queens in their chambers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he lifted up his face to the window,....

After which it continues, ‘And he said, Who art thou? Come down with me. And there looked out &c.’ Josephus makes Jezebel’s remark to be: ‘A pretty servant you, who have killed your master!’ and then describes Jehu’s reply in much the same way as the LXX. The Hebrew as represented in our version is exactly like the impetuous sentence of such a man as Jehu was.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">two</span> or <span class="ital">three eunuchs</span>] There is no conjunction in the original, as the italics in A.V. indicate. But in all languages the omission of connecting particles between numerals is common. There have however been several explanations offered; as that at first two looked forth and, soon after, another; or that two looked out at one window and three at another. Most likely the omission is a colloquial form of expression. ‘Twothree’, as one word, is used in some English dialects for ‘several’.

He had made up his mind for "war to the knife" before he embarked upon his enterprise, and the feeble attempts of a queen whose part was played out, whose age he knew, and whom he no doubt regarded as an old woman, had no power on him. Instead of responding to her blandishments, he took a stern and hard line. He would not see her privately. He summoned to his aid the menials of the palace - the eunuchs -those on whom beauty has least influence. "Who is on my side? <span class="accented">who</span>?" he exclaimed (literally, "Who is with me? who?"); thus calling on the court servants to desert their masters, the guards to turn their swords against their employers, the menials to consummate an intra-palatial revolution. We cannot deny to Jehu the credit of vigor, promptness, audacity, the talent to seize on the opportunity of the moment, and to make the most of it; but he must ever present himself to us as the rough soldier, with no courtesy, with no chivalry, bent on accomplishing his own ends, and shrinking from no deed of blood, no precedent <span class="accented">pessimi exempli</span>, if thereby his ends might be brought about. <span class="cmt_word">And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</span> Eunuchs had become an integral part both of the Jewish and of the Israelite courts from the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>). They are an institution which almost necessarily accompanies polygamy; and they had long held high office in. Egypt, in Babylon, and in Assyria. A position outside nature, at variance with all men's natural feelings and aspirations, of necessity depraves the character, weakens the moral principle, and ends by debasing the class. In Oriental history, the lowest, vilest part is always played by the eunuchs of the palace, who are ever ready to take part in any intrigues, in any conspiracies, and who seem to be almost wholly devoid of the ordinary feelings of humanity. The eunuchs who "looked out" to Jehu were probably the <span class="accented">chief</span> eunuchs of the palace, who had authority over the others, and indeed over the court officials generally. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehu then commanded his aide-de-camp (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>) Bidkar to cast the slain man into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, and said, "For remember how we, I and thou, both rode (or drove) behind his father Ahab, and Jehovah pronounced this threat upon him." &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; are accusatives, written with a looser connection for &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, as the apposition &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; shows: literally, think of me and thee, the riders. The olden translators were misled by &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, and therefore transposed &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; into the first person, and Thenius naturally follows them. &#1510;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, riding in pairs. This is the rendering adopted by most of the commentators, although it might be taken, as it is by Kimchi and Bochart, as signifying the two persons who are carried in the same chariot. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, a burden, then a prophetic utterance of a threatening nature (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>). For the connection of the clauses &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, see Ewald, 338, a. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a> Jehu quotes the word of God concerning Ahab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a> so far as the substance is concerned, to show that he is merely the agent employed in executing it. "Truly (&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488;, a particle used in an oath) the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons have I seen yesterday, saith the Lord, and upon this field will I requite him." The slaying of the sons of Naboth is not expressly mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>, "because it was so usual a thing, that the historian might leave it out as a matter of course" (J. D. Mich., Ewald). It necessarily followed, however, from the fact that Naboth's field was confiscated (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-14.htm">1 Kings 21:14</a>).</body></html>
