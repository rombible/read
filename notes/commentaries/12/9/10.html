Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chief officers - the generals - were assembled together in Jehu's quarters, perhaps holding a council of war.

The dogs in Eastern cities prowl hungrily about, and act as scavengers. Hence they are in bad repute, and the name ‘dog’ is one of greatest contempt. To be devoured by them was the extreme of degradation and penalty to an Oriental mind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the portion of Jezreel</span>] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-23.htm" title="And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.">1 Kings 21:23</a> the Hebrew word used signifies ‘wall’ (R.V. <span class="bld">rampart</span>) though according to some authorities the word should be the same which is used here. ‘By the rampart’ indicates that she should lie just where she was thrown down close to the city wall. The ‘portion’ signifies the ground a little more outlying, which in an Eastern town is used for the deposit of all offal and rubbish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> there shall be <span class="ital">none to bury</span> her] One moment she will be queen, the next, cast out of the window by the eunuchs, and her lot so changed that none shall care to go and see what becomes of her body.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel.</span> This had been previously prophesied by Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26, 27</a>). To an Israelite, and even to a Phoenician, it was an awful threat; for both nations alike buried their dead carefully in deep-dug graves or rocky receptacles, and both regarded the desecration of a corpse as a grievous calamity ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. pp. 112,114). The dog was to the Hebrews, and to the Orientals generally, an unclean animal, and to be devoured by dogs would have been viewed as a fate which, for a queen, was almost inconceivable. <span class="cmt_word">And there shall be none to bury her.</span> Jezebel had no one sufficiently interested in her fate to watch over her remains. Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had kept watch over the bodies of the seven sons of Saul, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>); and in Greece, if we may believe the poets, life had been risked, and actually forfeited, to save a near relative from similar ignominy (Soph., 'Ant.,' lines 245-743). But "Jezebel had none to bury her." When she was ejected from the palace window (ver. 33) and fell to the ground, and was trodden under foot by Jehu's chariot-horses, no one came forth from the palace to give the bruised and wounded corpse such tendance as was possible. There was entire neglect of the body for (probably) some hours; and, during these, the catastrophe occurred which Divine foresight had prophesied, but which human malice had not intended (see vers. 34-37). <span class="cmt_word">And he opened the door, and fled.</span> The young man the prophet obeyed to the letter the injunctions which Elisha had given him (ver. 3). The moment that he had executed his errand, he fled. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the young man, the servant of the prophet, went."
