Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Flee, and tarry not - The probable object of these directions was at once to prevent questioning, and to render the whole thing more striking. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6. So the young man &#8230; went to Ramoth-gilead&#8212;His ready undertaking of this delicate and hazardous mission was an eminent proof of his piety and obedience. The act of anointing being done through a commissioned prophet, was a divine intimation of his investiture with the sovereign power. But it was sometimes done long prior to the actual possession of the throne (1Sa 16:13); and, in like manner, the commission had, in this instance, been given also a long time before to Elijah [1Ki 19:16], who, for good reasons, left it in charge to Elisha; and he awaited God's time and command for executing it [Poole].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which is here noted as an eminent act of obedience, whereby he run into a manifest hazard of his life. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead. It is repeated, that it might be observed that it was a young man that went, who was more fit for this service than Elisha, partly because of his age, and partly because he would be less known; as also his age is remarked, this being a bold and daring action in a young man to anoint a new king, as well as it was honourable; and moreover, he was not only one of the sons of the prophets, but was a prophet himself, though young, and still a more fit person for such a service; though the Targum is, a young man, a disciple of the prophets. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the young man, even the young man the prophet</span> - the repetition of <span class="accented">han-na'ar</span> is doubtful, since it is not found either in the Syriac or in the Septuagint - <span class="cmt_word">went to Ramoth-Gilead.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ahaziah, like his father, reigned in the spirit of Ahab, because he allowed his mother to act as his adviser (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3-4</a>). </body></html>
