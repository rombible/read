Reuss asserts that this account of the anointing of Jehu, like that of the anointing of Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-13.htm" title="And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that you shall be king over Syria.">2Kings 8:13</a>), is substituted in the present narration for what another document related of <span class= "ital">Elijah</span>. This is pure conjecture. It is easier to suppose that Elijah had instructed his successor to carry out the commission intrusted to himself, although the narrative nowhere says so. He goes on to remark that there is no need to try to clear Elisha of the charge of being a revolutionary and a regicide, for that the new dynasty would make use of his name by way of legitimising itself, exactly as the houses of Kish and of Jesse made use of that of the prophet Samuel. This is being considerably wiser than our only authorities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm" title="And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.">2 Kings 9:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">He arose and went into the house — </span>That is, into an inner chamber in the house. <span class="ital">And he poured the oil on his head — </span>Thereby giving him, in God’s name both a right to the kingdom and the actual possession of it.

And it belonged to him to appoint what ruler he pleased over them; which he now did by his prophet.

Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chief officers - the generals - were assembled together in Jehu's quarters, perhaps holding a council of war. The place of assembly seems to have been the great court. Hence, Jehu "went into the house" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6</a> entered, that is, one of the rooms opening into the court. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6. So the young man &#8230; went to Ramoth-gilead&#8212;His ready undertaking of this delicate and hazardous mission was an eminent proof of his piety and obedience. The act of anointing being done through a commissioned prophet, was a divine intimation of his investiture with the sovereign power. But it was sometimes done long prior to the actual possession of the throne (1Sa 16:13); and, in like manner, the commission had, in this instance, been given also a long time before to Elijah [1Ki 19:16], who, for good reasons, left it in charge to Elisha; and he awaited God's time and command for executing it [Poole].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Into the house, </span> i.e. into an inner chamber in the house, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-2.htm" title="And when you come thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber;">2 Kings 9:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He poured the oil on his head; </span> thereby in God’s name letting him into the actual possession of the kingdom.
