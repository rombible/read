Their judgment, speech, and conduct are contrary to those of other men; they endure much in pursuit of objects, and are influenced by motives, into which the others cannot enter. But above all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of all sorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of the devoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable. Some faith in the word of God, seems to have animated Jehu to this undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had kept - Rather, "was keeping watch."

But these arguments seem not to be cogent. Not the former, because there might be some suburbs or outbuildings belonging to the city, or not far from it, which the Israelite might have in their possession. Nor the latter, as we shall there see. And if it was taken, why should all Israel be there to keep it, for which a strong garrison was sufficient? The words therefore may be otherwise rendered, exactly according to the Hebrew, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Joram had kept, </span> or <span class="ital">did keep</span>, (to wit, by his army left there,) or <span class="ital">put guards</span>, or <span class="ital">laid siege at</span>, or <span class="ital">to</span>, (for so the particle <span class="ital">beth</span> is oft used,) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ramoth-gilead.</span> And therefore he had all Israel, i.e. all the military force of Israel, with him, that he might both maintain the siege, and withal oppose Hazael, who sought to relieve it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram,....
