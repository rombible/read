Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Flee, and tarry not - The probable object of these directions was at once to prevent questioning, and to render the whole thing more striking. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>, that he was forty-two years old when he became king, rests upon a copyist's error, namely, a confusion of &#1499; twenty with &#1502; forty. Now, since his father became king at the age of thirty-two, and reigned eight years, Ahaziah must have been born in the nineteenth year of his age. Consequently it may appear strange that Ahaziah had brothers still older than himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>); but as early marriages are common in the East, and the royal princes had generally concubines along with their wife of the first rank, as is expressly stated of Joram in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>, he might have had some sons in his nineteenth year. His mother was called Athaliah, and was a daughter of the idolatrous Jezebel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a> she is called the daughter, i.e., grand-daughter, of Omri; for, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>, she was a daughter of Ahab. Omri, the grand-father, is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a> as the founder of the dynasty which brought so much trouble upon Israel and Judah through its idolatry. </body></html>
