Their judgment, speech, and conduct are contrary to those of other men; they endure much in pursuit of objects, and are influenced by motives, into which the others cannot enter. But above all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of all sorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of the devoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable. Some faith in the word of God, seems to have animated Jehu to this undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had kept - Rather, "was keeping watch."

Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead&#8212;rather, "was keeping," guarding, or besieging it, with the greater part of the military force of Israel. The king's wounds had compelled his retirement from the scene of action, and so the troops were left in command of Jehu.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When he fought with Hazael; </span> when he came with an army, either to retake the city taken by Joram, or to raise the siege. <span class="ital">Out of the city</span>; or, <span class="ital">from the city</span>; either from within the city, or from before it, from the siege or army. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To go to tell it in Jezreel; </span> that we may surprise him, and so more easily subdue him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But King Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel,....

If he stayed in his capital thus, while the army was in force at Ramoth-gilead and fully occupied with the Syrian foe, we can easily understand how the feelings of the soldiery would turn from him to the officers who remained with them, and especially to Jehu, who seems to have been the man of action among the number.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">If it be your minds</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">If this be your mind</span>. The LXX. renders ‘If your mind be with me’, which gives the sense, though there is nothing in the Hebrew to represent ‘with me’ any more than the ‘this’ of R.V. Jehu, as was fit until his throne was secure, takes counsel with his fellow-generals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let none go forth</span> nor <span class="ital">escape</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">let none escape and go forth</span>. The literal meaning of the Hebrew is ‘let no escaper go forth’. Hence the change in R.V. To secure this must be their care. Jehu himself with a faithful few will start at once to execute the judgement which has been laid upon him. His best chance of success is to take Joram by surprise.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But King Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael King of Syria</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 8:29). <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu said, If it be your minds.</span> As soon as he is proclaimed king, Jehu addresses himself to the captains, and proposes a policy. He does not venture to assume a tone of authority, or of imperative command, since he is still but a pretender, and not "established in the kingdom." "If it be your minds," he says; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "If you agree with me, and have nothing to urge against my proposal.

Secrecy was absolutely essential. If the revolt had got wind - and a single messenger might have carried the news - the whole attempt might have failed, or only have succeeded after a long and bloody civil war. All John's efforts were bent on keeping his revolt secret until he himself announced it to the astonished king (see ver. 22). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8-10</a> are simply a repetition of the threat in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-23</a>.
