Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chief officers - the generals - were assembled together in Jehu's quarters, perhaps holding a council of war. The place of assembly seems to have been the great court. Hence, Jehu "went into the house" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6</a> entered, that is, one of the rooms opening into the court. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6. So the young man &#8230; went to Ramoth-gilead&#8212;His ready undertaking of this delicate and hazardous mission was an eminent proof of his piety and obedience. The act of anointing being done through a commissioned prophet, was a divine intimation of his investiture with the sovereign power. But it was sometimes done long prior to the actual possession of the throne (1Sa 16:13); and, in like manner, the commission had, in this instance, been given also a long time before to Elijah [1Ki 19:16], who, for good reasons, left it in charge to Elisha; and he awaited God's time and command for executing it [Poole].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will make the house of Ahab, The same is threatened; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-22.htm">1 Kings 21:22</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">like the house of Jeroboam</span>] Against whom the like prophecy is spoken in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man takes away dung, till it be all gone.">1 Kings 14:10</a>, and against Baasha in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/16-3.htm" title="Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat....">1 Kings 16:3-4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> Jeroboam's house had been "cut off," smitten, destroyed, till not one of his posterity was left, about seventy years previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>), by Baasha, "because of his sins which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-30.htm">1 Kings 15:30</a>).

Zimri, who "smote him and killed him," and succeeded him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-11.htm">1 Kings 16:11</a>). The house of Ahab had had a double warning of the fate in reserve for those who deserted the religion of Jehovah, but had disregarded both warnings alike, and had provoked God yet more than their predecessors, by introducing a novel and degraded form of idolatrous worship. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1-3</a> contain the instructions which Elisha gave to the pupil of the prophets. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1498; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, look round there for Jehu. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493;, let him (bid him) rise up from the midst of his brethren, i.e., of his comrades in arms. &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491;&#1512; &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;: the true meaning is, "into the innermost chamber" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-30.htm">1 Kings 20:30</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-3.htm">2 Kings 9:3</a> contains only the leading points of the commission to Jehu, the full particulars are communicated in the account of the fulfilment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6</a>.
