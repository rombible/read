Perhaps the article has fallen out; especially as this is not the only indication that the text has suffered in this place.

He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And burned the high place - This "high place" is to be distinguished from the altar and the grove (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492;  'a&#774;she&#770;ra&#770;h).

Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, &c.&#8212;Not satisfied with the removal of every vestige of idolatry from his own dominion, this zealous iconoclast made a tour of inspection through the cities of Samaria and all the territory formerly occupied by the ten tribes, destroying the altars and temples of the high places, consigning the Asherim to the flames, putting to death the priests of the high places, and showing his horror at idolatry by ransacking the sepulchers of idolatrous priests, and strewing the burnt ashes of their bones upon the altars before he demolished them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The altar that was at Beth-el.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Question.</span> How could he rightly do this, seeing Beth-el was a part of the kingdom of Israel, not of Judah? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer.</span> Either, first, This city was now under the kingdom of Judah, to which it was added by Abijah long since, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm" title="And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.">2 Chronicles 13:19</a></span>.

Or, thirdly, The king of Babylon having engaged in a war with the Assyrian, Hezekiah’s great enemy, and having thereupon occasion for Hezekiah’s friendship, did (as some suppose) enlarge his dominion, and give him some power over the kingdom of Israel, at least as to matters of religion; which may seem not improbable from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/30-1.htm" title="And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel....">2 Chronicles 30:1-6</a></span>.

Having purged his own kingdom from idolatry he now turns his thoughts to those Israelites who were left in the northern kingdom. The Chronicler, who omits the history of Israel almost entirely, probably omits the striking incident noticed in these verses because it was not connected directly with Judah. He does tell of the collection of money from Manasseh, Ephraim and the remnant of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm" title="Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>) at this time, but this was for the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and so came properly within his subject.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">both</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">even</span>] <span class="ital">that altar and the high place</span>] The ‘high place’ means here, and often in other passages, ‘the house of the high place’, which was some sort of chapel near to the spot where the altar stood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> [R.V. adds <span class="bld">he</span>] <span class="ital">burnt the high place … and burnt the grove</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Asherah</span>.

At such a national center as Bethel a temple would, of course, accompany the altar. Whether the temple and altar were in use or not at the time when Josiah destroyed them, is uncertain. The mixed race which had superseded the Israelites in the country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24-41</a>) may have continued the worship, or may have set it aside. <span class="cmt_word">And burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder</span>.

The &#1488;&#1498; is connected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a> : Josiah did not allow the priests, whom he had brought out of the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, to offer sacrifice upon the altar of Jehovah in the temple, i.e., to perform the sacrificial service of the law, though he did allow them "to eat that which was unleavened," i.e., to eat of the sacred altar-gifts intended for the priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9-10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>); only they were not allowed to consume this at a holy place, but simply in the midst of their brethren, i.e., at home in the family.
