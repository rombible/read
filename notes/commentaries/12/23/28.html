The reforming king is cut off in the midst of his usefulness, in mercy to him, that he might not see the evil coming upon his kingdom: but in wrath to his people, for his death was an inlet to their desolations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Josiah lived for 13 years after the celebration of his great Passover. Of this period we know absolutely nothing, except that in the course of it he seems to have submitted himself to Nabopolassar; who, after the fall of Nineveh, was accepted as the legitimate successor of the Assyrian monarchs by all the nations of the western coast. Josiah, after perhaps a little hesitation (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a>), followed the example of his neighbors, and frankly accepted the position of an Assyro-Babylonian tributary. In this state matters remained until 608 B.C., when the great events happened which are narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. Notwithstanding, the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his wrath,&#8212;&c. The national reformation which Josiah carried on was acquiesced in by the people from submission to the royal will; but they entertained a secret and strong hankering after the suppressed idolatries. Though outwardly purified, their hearts were not right towards God, as appears from many passages of the prophetic writings; their thorough reform was hopeless; and God, who saw no sign of genuine repentance, allowed His decree (2Ki 21:12-15) for the subversion of the kingdom to take fatal effect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did,....

Politically, the time was a stirring one. The great invasion of Western Asia by the Scythic hordes (Herod., 1:103-106), which is alluded to by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38, 39</a>, and perhaps by <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a>, probably belongs to it; as also the attack of Psamatik I. upon Philistia (Herod., 2:105), the fall of the Assyrian empire (circ.  <span class="date">B.C. 617</span>), and the destruction of Nineveh: the establishment of the independence of Babylon, and her rise to greatness; together with the transfer of power in the central part of Western Asia, from the Assyrians to the Medea. Amid the dangers which beset him, Josiah appears to have conducted himself prudently, gradually extending his power over Samaria and Galilee, without coming into hostile collision with any of the neighboring nations, until about the year  <span class="date">B.C. 609</span> or 608, when his land was invaded by Pharaoh-Nechoh, the Neku of the Egyptian monuments. Josiah felt himself called upon to resist this invasion, and, in doing so, met his death (vers. 29, 30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did.</span> Josiah was reckoned a good rather than a great king. No mention is made of his "might." The writer of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>) commemorates his "kindnesses" or "his good deeds." The son of Sirach speaks of his "upright" behavior (Ecclus. 49:2). Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:4. &sect; 1) praises his "justice" and his "piety," and says (ibid., 10:4. &sect; 5) his later years were passed "in peace and opulence." <span class="cmt_word">Are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-27.htm">2 Chronicles 35:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The passover is very briefly noticed in our account, and is described as such an one as had not taken place since the days of the <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2.htm">Judges 2</a> Kings <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/23-21.htm">Judges 23:21</a> simply mentions the appointment of this festival on the part of the king, and the execution of the king's command has to be supplied. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a> contains a remark concerning the character of the passover. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-1.htm">2 Chronicles 35:1-19</a> we have a very elaborate description of it. What distinguished this passover above every other was, (1) that "all the nation," not merely Judah and Benjamin, but also the remnant of the ten tribes, took part in it, or, as it is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>, "all Judah and Israel;" (2) that it was kept in strict accordance with the precepts of the Mosaic book of the law, whereas in the passover instituted by Hezekiah there were necessarily many points of deviation from the precepts of the law, more especially in the fact that the feast had to be transferred from the first month, which was the legal time, to the second month, because the priests had not yet purified themselves in sufficient numbers and the people had not yet gathered together at Jerusalem, and also that even then a number of the people had inevitably been allowed to eat the passover without the previous purification required by the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2-3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-17.htm">2 Chronicles 30:17-20</a>). This is implied in the words, "for there was not holden such a passover since the days of the judges and all the kings of Israel and Judah." That this remark does not preclude the holding of earlier passovers, as Thenius follows De Wette in supposing, without taking any notice of the refutations of this opinion, was correctly maintained by the earlier commentators. Thus Clericus observes: "I should have supposed that what the sacred writer meant to say was, that during the times of the kings no passover had ever been kept so strictly by every one, according to all the Mosaic laws. Before this, even under the pious kings, they seem to have followed custom rather than the very words of the law; and since this was the case, many things were necessarily changed and neglected." Instead of "since the days of the judges who judged Israel," we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>, "since the days of Samuel the prophet," who is well known to have closed the period of the judges.</body></html>
