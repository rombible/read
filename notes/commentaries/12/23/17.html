He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour.

As the horses were only cleared away (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;), whereas the chariots were burned, we have not to think of images of horses (Selden, de Diis Syr. ii. 8), but of living horses, which were given to the sun, i.e., kept for the worship of the sun. Horses were regarded as sacred to the sun by many nations, viz., the Armenians, Persians, Massagetae, Ethiopians, and Greeks, and were sacrificed to it (for proofs see Bochart, Hieroz. i. lib. ii. c. 10); and there is no doubt that the Israelites received this worship first of all from Upper Asia, along with the actual sun-worship, possibly through the Assyrians. "The kings of Judah" are Ahaz, Manasseh, and Amon. These horses were hardly kept to be offered to the sun in sacrifice (Bochart and others), but, as we must infer from the "chariots of the sun," were used for processions in connection with the worship of the sun, probably, according to the unanimous opinion of the Rabbins, to drive and meet the rising sun. The definition &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, "from the coming into the house of Jehovah," i.e., near the entrance into the temple, is dependent upon &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, "they had given (placed) the horses of the sun near the temple entrance," &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;, "in the cell of Nethanmelech." &#1488;&#1500; does not mean at the cell, i.e., in the stable by the cell (Thenius), because the ellipsis is too harsh, and the cells built in the court of the temple were intended not merely as dwelling-places for the priests and persons engaged in the service, but also as a dept for the provisions and vessels belonging to the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>). One of these depts was arranged and used as a stable for the sacred horses. This cell, which derived its name from Nethanmelech, a chamberlain (&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;), of whom nothing further is known, possibly the builder or founder of it, was &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, in the Pharvars. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, the plural of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;, is no doubt identical with &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a>. This was the name given to a building at the western or hinder side of the outer temple-court by the gate Shalleket at the ascending road, i.e., the road which led up from the city standing in the west into the court of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a>). The meaning of the word &#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; is uncertain. Gesenius (thes. p. 1123) explains it by porticus, after the Persian frwa&#770;r, summer-house, an open kiosk. Bttcher (Proben, p. 347), on the other hand, supposes it to be "a separate spot resembling a suburb," because in the Talmud &#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; signifies suburbia, loca urbi vicinia.</body></html>
