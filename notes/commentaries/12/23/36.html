The wicked perished in great numbers, the remnant were purified, and Josiah's reformation had raised up some to join the few who were the precious seed of their future church and nation. A little time, and slender abilities, often suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years, been labouring to effect. But, blessed be God, the good work which he begins by his regenerating Spirit, cannot be done away, but withstands all changes and temptations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Twenty and five years old - Jehoiakim was therefore two years older than his half-brother, Jehoahaz <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>.

If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>, where the prophet draws a parallel between the lamentation at the death of the Messiah and the lamentation of Hadad-Rimmon in the valley of Megiddo, as the deepest lamentation of the people in the olden time, with the account given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a> of the lamentation of the whole nation at the death of Josiah, there can hardly be any doubt that Josiah died on the way to Jerusalem at Hadad-Rimmon, the present Rummane, to the south of Lejun (see above), and was taken to Jerusalem dead. - He was followed on the throne by his younger son Jehoahaz, whom the people (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-24.htm">2 Kings 21:24</a>) anointed king, passing over the elder, Eliakim, probably because they regarded him as the more able man. </body></html>
