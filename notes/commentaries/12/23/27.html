The national reformation which Josiah carried on was acquiesced in by the people from submission to the royal will; but they entertained a secret and strong hankering after the suppressed idolatries. Though outwardly purified, their hearts were not right towards God, as appears from many passages of the prophetic writings; their thorough reform was hopeless; and God, who saw no sign of genuine repentance, allowed His decree (2Ki 21:12-15) for the subversion of the kingdom to take fatal effect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, upon the conditions in sundry places expressed, which they broke, and therefore God justly made them to know his breach of promise, as he threatens, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-34.htm" title="After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.">Numbers 14:34</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel.

God "chose" Jerusalem when he put it into the heart of David to bring up the ark thither (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the house of which I said, My Name shall he there</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>, etc.). A visible confirmation was given to all that David and Solomon had done in establishing the temple at Jerusalem as the head-quarters of the national religion, when "fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices" made there, and "the glory of the Lord filled the house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13, 14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The passover is very briefly noticed in our account, and is described as such an one as had not taken place since the days of the <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2.htm">Judges 2</a> Kings <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/23-21.htm">Judges 23:21</a> simply mentions the appointment of this festival on the part of the king, and the execution of the king's command has to be supplied. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a> contains a remark concerning the character of the passover. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-1.htm">2 Chronicles 35:1-19</a> we have a very elaborate description of it. What distinguished this passover above every other was, (1) that "all the nation," not merely Judah and Benjamin, but also the remnant of the ten tribes, took part in it, or, as it is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>, "all Judah and Israel;" (2) that it was kept in strict accordance with the precepts of the Mosaic book of the law, whereas in the passover instituted by Hezekiah there were necessarily many points of deviation from the precepts of the law, more especially in the fact that the feast had to be transferred from the first month, which was the legal time, to the second month, because the priests had not yet purified themselves in sufficient numbers and the people had not yet gathered together at Jerusalem, and also that even then a number of the people had inevitably been allowed to eat the passover without the previous purification required by the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2-3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-17.htm">2 Chronicles 30:17-20</a>). This is implied in the words, "for there was not holden such a passover since the days of the judges and all the kings of Israel and Judah." That this remark does not preclude the holding of earlier passovers, as Thenius follows De Wette in supposing, without taking any notice of the refutations of this opinion, was correctly maintained by the earlier commentators. Thus Clericus observes: "I should have supposed that what the sacred writer meant to say was, that during the times of the kings no passover had ever been kept so strictly by every one, according to all the Mosaic laws. Before this, even under the pious kings, they seem to have followed custom rather than the very words of the law; and since this was the case, many things were necessarily changed and neglected." Instead of "since the days of the judges who judged Israel," we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>, "since the days of Samuel the prophet," who is well known to have closed the period of the judges.</body></html>
