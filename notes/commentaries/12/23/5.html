Here, as in the passage of Hosea, the word denotes the unlawful priests of Jehovah, as contrasted with those of the Baal, mentioned in the next place. Whether the term really means <span class= "ital">black-robed</span>, as Kimchi explains, is questionable. Priests used to wear <span class= "ital">white</span> throughout the ancient world, except on certain special occasions. Gesenius derives it from a root meaning <span class= "ital">black</span>, but explains, <span class= "ital">one clad in black, i.e., a mourner, an ascetic</span>, and so a <span class= "ital">priest</span>. Perhaps the true derivation is from another root, meaning to <span class= "ital">weave: weaver of spells</span> or <span class= "ital">charms</span>; as magic was an invariable concomitant of false worship. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-17.htm" title="And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Kings 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm" title="And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Kings 21:6</a>.) It is a regular word for priest in Syriac (chûmrâ; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>; and the Ep. to the Heb., <span class= "ital">passim</span>.)<p><span class= "bld">To burn incense.</span>—So Syriac, Vulg., and Arabic.

But it is better to supply <span class= "ital">and</span> with all the versions. <span class= "ital">Bel and Samas</span> were distinct deities in the Assyro-Babylonian system. When Reuss remarks that “the knowledge of the old Semitic worships, possessed by the Hebrew historians, appears to have been very superficial, for Baal and the sun are one and the same deity,” he lays himself open to the same charge.<p><span class= "bld">The planets.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">the signs of the Zodiac</span>. The Heb. is <span class= "ital">mazzalôth</span>, probably a variant form of <span class= "ital">mazzarôth</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm" title="Can you bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or can you guide Arcturus with his sons?">Job 38:32</a>). The word is used in the Targums, and by rabbinical writers, in the sense of star, as <span class= "ital">influencing human destiny</span>, and so fate, <span class= "ital">fortune</span>, in the singular, and in the plural of the signs of the Zodiac (<span class= "ital">e.g</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm" title="This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm" title="In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.">Esther 3:7</a>). It is, perhaps, derived from ’<span class= "ital">azar</span>, “to gird,” and means “belt,” or “girdle;” or from ’<span class= "ital">azal</span>, “to journey,” and so means “stages” of the sun’s course in the heavens.
