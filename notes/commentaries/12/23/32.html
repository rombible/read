A little time, and slender abilities, often suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years, been labouring to effect.

He restored that idolatry which his father had destroyed, partly to gratify the generality of the people, who had made him king, and who were inclined to their old superstitions even in Josiah’s time, as was observed before, though restrained from the outward acts by fear; and partly to sweeten the king of Egypt, who possibly was a zealous idolater, by his compliance with him in the worship of idols. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,....

With this sentence, in which &#1513;&#1489;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1498; forms an unmistakeable word-play upon &#1497;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1489;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, the historian introduces the account not merely of the end of Josiah's reign, but also of the destruction of the kingdom of Judah. Manasseh is mentioned here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a> as the person who, by his idolatry and his unrighteousness, with which he provoked God to anger, had brought upon Judah and Jerusalem the unavoidable judgment of rejection. It is true that Josiah had exterminated outward and gross idolatry throughout the land by his sincere conversion to the Lord, and by his zeal for the restoration of the lawful worship of Jehovah, and had persuaded the people to enter into covenant with its God once more; but a thorough conversion of the people to the Lord he had not been able to effect. For, as Clericus has correctly observed, "although the king was most religious, and the people obeyed him through fear, yet for all that the mind of the people was not changed, as is evident enough from the reproaches of Jeremiah, Zephaniah, and other prophets, who prophesied about that time and a little after." With regard to this point compare especially the first ten chapters of Jeremiah, which contain a resum of his labours in the reign of Josiah, and bear witness to the deep inward apostasy of the people from the Lord, not only before and during Josiah's reform of worship, but also afterwards. As the Holy One of Israel, therefore, God could not forgive any more, but was obliged to bring upon the people and kingdom, after the death of Josiah, the judgment already foretold to Manasseh himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a>.).</body></html>
