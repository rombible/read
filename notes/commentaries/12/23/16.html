Thenius does not go so far as this, but assumes that the proper sequel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1Kings 13:1-32</a>, has been transferred to this place. He argues that it must be an interpolation here, because (1) the “moreover” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a> (<span class= "ital">w</span>ě<span class= "ital">gam</span>) corresponds to the “and . . . also” (<span class= "ital">w</span>ě<span class= "ital">gam</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-19.htm" title="And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.">2Kings 23:19</a>, which does not prove much; and because (2) Josiah could not pollute the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-16.htm" title="And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them on the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.">2Kings 23:16</a>) after he had already <span class= "ital">shattered it in pieces</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a>). This reasoning is not conclusive, because it is obvious that, as is so often the case, the writer has first told in brief what was done to the altar and high place at Bethel, and then related at length an interesting incident that occurred at the time. In short, the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a> is anticipatory.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">Turned himself.</span>—So that he caught sight of the tombs on the hill-side opposite—not on the hill where the high place was.<p><span class= "bld">The man of God proclaimed.</span>—Some words appear to have fallen out of the Hebrew text here, for the LXX. <span class= "ital">adds</span>, “when Jeroboam stood in the feast at the altar.

He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour.
