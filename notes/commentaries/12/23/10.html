Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great.

The later Jewish kings, Manasseh and Amon (or, perhaps, Ahaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>), had given it over to the Moloch priests for their worship; and here, ever since, the Moloch service had maintained its ground and flourished (marginal references).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The root of the word is thought by some to be <span class="accented">taph</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e3;</span>), "a drum," because the cries of the children burnt there were drowned by the beating of drums.

Persian <span class="accented">taftan</span>, Sanskrit tap, etc., and regard the meaning as simply "the place of burning" (see the comment on Isaiah 30:33). <span class="cmt_word">Which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom.</span> The valley of Hinnom, or of the sons of Hinnom, is generally allowed to be that which sweeps round the more western of the two hills whereon Jerusalem was built, in a direction at first south and then east, uniting itself with the Kidron valley a little to the south of Ophel. The origin of the name is uncertain; but it is most likely that the Beni-Hinnom were a tribe of Canaanites, settled on this side of Jerusalem in the time of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>). The "valley" is a ravine, deep and narrow, with steep, rocky sides. When the Moloch-worship first began in it we cannot say; but it was probably before the time of Solomon, who built a high place for Moloch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11</a>), on one of the heights by which the valley is enclosed. (On the horrible profanations of the Moloch-worship, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>.) After the Captivity, the valley of Hinnom - Ge-Hinnom - was reckoned an accursed and abominable place, a sort of earthly counterpart of the place of final punishment, which. thence derived its name of "Geheuna" (<span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>); (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22, 29</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Moloch</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 16:3). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The eradication of idolatry. - According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3-7</a>, this had already begun, and was simply continued and carried to completion after the renewal of the covenant.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a><p>In Jerusalem and Judah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>.

Pal. i. p. 405). "And he had their dust carried to Bethel," i.e., the ashes of the wooden objects which were burned, and the dust of those of stone and metal which were ground to powder, to defile the idolatrous place of worship at Bethel as the chief seat of idolatry and false worship.</body></html>
