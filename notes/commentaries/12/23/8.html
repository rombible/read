Joshua is an unknown personage, and it is not clear whether “the gate of Joshua” was a gate of the city named after him, or the great gate of his residence; nor is it certain that “the gate of the city” was that now called the Jaffa Gate. It is possible that the governor’s residence lay near the principal gate of the city, on the left as one entered. Several “high places” stood in the open space in front of it, between it and the city gate.

One would not have believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel, where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history, and the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness or goodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spirit of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Josiah removed the Levitical priests, who had officiated at the various high-places, from the scenes of their idolatries, and brought them to Jerusalem, where their conduct might be watched.<p>From Geba to Beer-sheba - i. e., from the extreme north to the extreme south of the kingdom of Judah.

According to this, there were only two "high-places of the gates" (or idolatrous shrines erected in the city at gate-towers) at Jerusalem.

These irregularities, even though the object of that worship was the true God, were prohibited in the law (De 12:11). Those who had been guilty of this sin, Josiah brought to Jerusalem. Regarding them as defiled, he debarred them from the service of the temple, but gave them an allowance out of the temple revenues, like the lame and disabled members of the priesthood (Le 21:21, 22).<p>from Geba to to Beer-sheba&#8212;the most northern and the most southern places in Judah&#8212;meaning all parts of the kingdom.<p>the high places &#8230; which were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua&#8212;The governor's house and gate were on the left of the city gate, and close by the entrance of that civic mansion house were public altars, dedicated, it might be, to the true God, but contrary to His own ordinance of worship (Isa 57:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the priests, </span> to wit, belonging to the high places there following, whether such as worshipped idols, or rather, such as worshipped God in those forbidden places, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm" title="Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:">Deu 12:11</a></span>, as may be gathered from the following verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Defiled the high places, </span> by burning dead men’s bones upon them, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-14.htm" title="And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.">2 Kings 23:14</a>,16,20</span>, or by putting them to some other unclean or filthy use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From Geba; </span> the northern border of the kingdom of Judah; of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm" title="And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:">Joshua 18:24</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm" title="Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.">1 Kings 15:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">To Beer-sheba</span>, which was the southern border; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm" title="Why he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore both of them.">Genesis 21:31</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.">Judges 20:1</a></span>; i.e. from one end to the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The high places of the gates; </span> which were erected by the gates of the city here mentioned, unto the honour of their tutelary gods, which after the manner of the heathen they owned for the protectors of their city and habitations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city:</span> this circumstance is noted to show Josiah’s great zeal and impartiality, in rooting out all monuments of idolatry, without any respect unto those great persons who were concerned in them, or affected to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah,....

In that case, as the text speaks of ‘high places’, we must understand that there was more than one ‘high place’ in the same neighbourhood. But as they are called ‘high places of the <span class="ital">gates</span>’ it has seemed necessary to some to render the words as if a conjunction were omitted, ‘The high places of the <span class="ital">gates</span>, that which was in the entering in of the <span class="ital">gate</span> of Joshua … and also that which was … at the <span class="ital">gate</span> of the city’. Thus the two localities would be different. As ‘the gate of Joshua’ is mentioned nowhere else, we cannot say where it was, or whether a gate so described could also be called ‘a gate of the city’. It seems more probable that it was some inner gate, near the governor’s official residence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah.</span> Here the writer diverges from his proper subject - the reforms in and near Jerusalem - to speak of changes which were made in other parts of Judaea. The Levitical priests, who in various cities of Judah had conducted the worship at the high places, were summoned to Jerusalem by Josiah, and forced to remain there, that the unauthorized worship which they had conducted might be brought to an end. <span class="cmt_word">And defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense.</span> Hezekiah had "removed the high places, and broken the images, and cut down the groves" throughout his dominions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), but he had not in any way "defiled the high places;" and therefore no sooner did a king take a different view of his duties than the worship was at once restored (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), and flourished as before. Josiah conceived the idea that, if the high places were "defiled," it would be impossible to renew the worship at them. <span class="cmt_word">From Geba to Beersheba.</span> Geba takes here the place of Bethel as the northern limit of Judah. It was situated at a very short distance from Bethel, and was made to supersede it on account of the idolatries by which Bethel had been disgraced. The exact site is probably the modern <span class="accented">Jeba</span>, on the southern edge of the Wady Suweinit. <span class="cmt_word">And brake down the high places of the gates.</span> The high-place worship had, it would seem, invaded Jerusalem itself. In some of the gates of the city, which were "large open buildings for public meetings and intercourse" (Bahr), altars, or more elaborate places of worship, had been established, and an unauthorized ritual of the high-place type had been set up. That were  - rather, <span class="accented">that which was - <span class="cmt_word"></span>in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city.</span> This and the succeeding clauses are limitations of the general statement concerning the "high places of the gates," and indicate that two gates only had been polluted by high-place worship, viz.

Beside the priests, Josiah also gathered together the prophets, including perhaps Jeremiah and Zedekiah, that he might carry out the solemn conclusion of the covenant with their co-operation, and, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1-11</a>, that they might then undertake the task, by their impressive preaching in Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, of making the people conscious of the earnestness of the covenant duties which they had so recently undertaken (see Oehler in Herzog's Cycl.). Instead of the prophets, the Levites are mentioned in the Chronicles, probably only because the Levites are mentioned along with the priests in other cases of a similar kind. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, he read, i.e., had it read; for the duty of reading the law in the temple devolved upon the priests as the keepers of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>.).</body></html>
