The LXX. omits the particle of comparison: <span class= "greekheb">ὅτι οὐκ ἐγενήθη τὸ πασχα τοῦτο</span>. On the ground of this difference, and the one mentioned in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-21.htm" title="And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.">2Kings 23:21</a>, Thenius thinks it not improbable that the text of Kings has been altered to bring into harmony with the account in Chronicles about the restoration of the feast of the passover by <span class= "ital">Hezekiah</span>—a weighty inference from such slight data. The chronicler repeats this very verse at the close of his narrative of Josiah’s passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm" title="And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 35:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-22.htm" title="Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;">2 Kings 23:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Surely there was not holden such a passover, </span>&c. — Celebrated with such solemn care, and great preparation, and numerous sacrifices, and universal joy of all good men; which was much the greater, because of their remembrance of the former wicked and miserable times under Manasseh and Amon; and the good hopes they now had of the happy establishment of their nation, and the true religion; and of the prevention of God’s judgments denounced against them. <span class="ital">From the days of the judges — </span>Or, of Samuel, the last of the judges; as it is expressed <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm" title="And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>. None of the kings had taken such care to prepare themselves, the priests, and people, and so accurately to observe all the rites, and diligently to purge out all uncleanness, and to renew their covenant with God. And undoubtedly God was pleased to recompense their zeal in destroying idolatry, with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. All this concurred to make it such a passover as had not been even in the days of Hezekiah. For in his passover many communicated who were not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary, and the Levites were permitted to do the work of the priests.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:15-24 Josiah's zeal extended to the cities of Israel within his reach. He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour.

Many of the Israelites who were at Jerusalem might have heard of, if they did not hear, the law read by Josiah.

The king had said ‘<span class="ital">Keep</span> the passover’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This verse cannot be tortured into the meaning which some have put upon it, that the passover had been wholly neglected since the days of the Judges, or as the Chronicler puts it, ‘the days of Samuel the prophet’, and through all the reigns of the previous kings of Judah, with the exception of the one recorded passover of Hezekiah. That the passovers are not mentioned comes about because they were a part of the life of the nation, which went on its natural round as a matter of course. That there was a relaxation in portions of the observance we can have no doubt, but that passovers ceased is as little to be accepted as that there was no observance of the great day of atonement because we do not read of it in the books of Samuel or Kings. It is not possible to believe that provision should have been regularly made for placing the ark of the covenant in a separate room, and that Solomon should have made the elaborate arrangements which he did for the Most holy place, and yet that there should have been no regard paid to the one solemn service for which alone the ark and the Holy of Holies were provided. Both the passover and the day of atonement were observed, though there were times when insufficient regard was paid to the required ceremonial. The passover of Josiah however went back to the complete form ordained in this book of the covenant, and in that respect was remarkable above all those which had been held since the days of Joshua and the elders that outlived Joshua, after which days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm" title="And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.">Jdg 2:10</a>) ‘there arose another generation’ and the people fell away, and the ceremonial law was but partially observed, and never so strictly through all that period as in this great passover of king Josiah.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely there was not holden such a Passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah. </span> <span class="accented">Such</span> a Passover, one so numerously attended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>). and so exactly kept according to every ordinance of the Law of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-6.htm">2 Chronicles 35:6</a>), had not been celebrated during all the period of the judges, from Joshua to Samuel, nor under the kings of all Israel, Saul, David, and Solomon, nor under those of the separated kingdom of Judah, from Rehoboam to this year (the eighteenth) of Josiah. It is an extraordinary perversity which concludes (as do De Wette and Thenius), from this comparison of the present with former Passovers under the judges and the kings, that there had been no such former Passovers at all! Two, at any rate, are recorded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-13.htm">2 Chronicles 30:13-26</a>). Ewald has the good sense to express his dissent from this view, and to declare the meaning of the writer to be simply that "since the time of the judges there had never been such a celebration of the Passover, in such strict accordance, that is, with the prescriptions of a sacred book as that which now took place" (see his 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 239, Eng. trans.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In order to desecrate this idolatrous site for all time, Josiah had human bones taken out of the graves that were to be found upon the mountain, and burned upon the altar, whereby the prophecy uttered in the reign of Jeroboam by the prophet who came out of Judah concerning this idolatrous place of worship was fulfilled; but he spared the tomb of that prophet himself (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-26.htm">1 Kings 13:26-32</a>). The mountain upon which Josiah saw the graves was a mountain at Bethel, which was visible from the bamah destroyed. &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, a sepulchral monument, probably a stone erected upon the grave. &#1493;&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;: "so they rescued (from burning) his bones (the bones of the prophet who had come from Judah), together with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria," i.e., of the old prophet who sprang from the kingdom of the ten tribes and had come to Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>). &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; in antithesis to &#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; ot sisehtit &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; denotes simply descent from the land of Samaria.<p>(Note: <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16-18</a> are neither an interpolation of the editor, i.e., of the author of our books of Kings (Staehelin), nor an interpolation from a supplement to the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1-32</a> (Thenius).
