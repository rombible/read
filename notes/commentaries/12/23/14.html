One would not have believed it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel, where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-place was, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great.

Bones of men had also the actual taint of corruption about them. The "uncleanness" of dead bodies arose first out of man's natural shrinking from death, and was then further confirmed by the horrors accompanying decay. The notion was probably coeval with death itself. It received a sanction from the Law, which made it a legal defilement to touch a corpse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11, 16</a>), and placed under a sentence of uncleanness all that was in the tent where a man died (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14, 15</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the (Levitical) priests he sent for from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, and defiled the altars of the high places, upon which they had offered incense, from Geba to Beersheba, i.e., throughout the whole kingdom. Geba, the present Jeba, about three hours to the north of Jerusalem (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>), was the northern frontier of the kingdom of Judah, and Beersheba (Bir-seba: see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>) the southern frontier of Canaan. It is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-9.htm">2 Kings 23:9</a> that &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are Levitical priests. He ordered them to come to Jerusalem, that they might not carry on illegal worship any longer in the cities of Judah. He then commanded that the unlawful high places should be defiled throughout the whole land, for the purpose of suppressing this worship altogether. He also destroyed "the altars of the high places at the gates, (both that) which was at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, (and also that) which was at the left of every one (entering) by the city gate." The two clauses beginning with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; contain a more precise description of &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;. The gate of Joshua the governor of the city is not mentioned anywhere else, but it was probably near to his home, i.e., near the citadel of the city; but whether it was the future gate of Gennath, as Thenius supposes, or some other, it is impossible to determine. This also applies to the opinion that &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; is the valley gate or Joppa gate (Thenius) as being the gate of greatest traffic; for the traffic through the northern or Ephraim gate was certainly not less. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, at the left of every one, sc. going into the city.</body></html>
