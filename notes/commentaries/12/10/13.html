Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness from that which is the cause of all misery?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The brethren of Ahaziah - Not the actual brothers of Ahaziah, who had all been slain by the Arabs before his accession to the throne <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a>; but his nephews, the sons of his brothers (marginal reference).

The princes were thus not surprised at the inquiry, and readily answered it. <span class="cmt_word">And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king.</span> There is something abnormal and needing explanation in this visit. <span class="accented">Forty-two</span> princes, with their retinues, do not, under ordinary circumstances, start off on a sudden from one capital, on a complimentary visit to their cousins at another. Perhaps Ewald is right in surmising that, "at the first report of disturbances in the kingdom of the ten tribes, they had been sent off by Athaliah to render any assistance that they could to the house of Ahab in its troubles" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 100, Eng. trans.). In this case their answer must be regarded as insincere. Falling in with an armed force stronger than their own, they <span class="accented">pretended</span> ignorance of the revolution that had taken place, and sought to pass off their hostile purpose under the pretence of a visit of compliment. But the pretence did not deceive Jehu. <span class="cmt_word">And the children of the queen.</span> The queen-mother, Jezebel, is probably intended. Her rank entitled her to special mention. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehu then wrote them a second letter, to say that if they would hearken to his voice, they were to send to him on the morrow at this time, to Jezreel, the heads of the sons of their lord; which they willingly did, slaying the seventy men, and sending him their heads in baskets. &#1488;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, "the heads of the men of sons of your lord," i.e., of the male descendants of Ahab, in which &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; may be explained from the fact that &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; has the meaning "royal princes" (see the similar case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22</a>). In order to bring out still more clearly the magnitude of Jehu's demand, the number of the victims required is repeated in the circumstantial clause, "and there were seventy men of the king's sons with (&#1488;&#1514;) the great men of the city, who had brought them up." </body></html>
