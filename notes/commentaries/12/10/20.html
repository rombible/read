But it should be observed, that as Jehu was a person of known indifference in matters of religion, who in this respect had always conformed to the humours of the court, and in the reign of King Ahab had been a strenuous worshipper of Baal; the people could not tell, when they read his proclamation for a great feast to Baal, but that he had returned, in good earnest, to the religion which he once embraced, and only deserted for a while, in complacency to others. But whether they deluded themselves into this persuasion or not, they knew by experience that Jehu was a man of a fierce and bloody temper, who would not fail to put his threats in execution; and, therefore, reading in the same proclamation, <span class="ital">Whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-19.htm" title="Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.

Hence they thought it the wisest method to run the hazard, and throw themselves upon his mercy; having this, at least, to plead for themselves, that they were not disobedient to his commands.

This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel.

They might be easily convened into one spacious temple, as their number had been greatly diminished both by the influential ministrations of Elijah and Elisha, and also from the late King Joram's neglect and discontinuance of the worship. Jehu's appointment of a solemn sacrifice in honor of Baal, and a summons to all his worshippers to join in its celebration, was a deep-laid plot, which he had resolved upon for their extinction, a measure in perfect harmony with the Mosaic law, and worthy of a constitutional king of Israel. It was done, however, not from religious, but purely political motives, because he believed that the existence and interests of the Baalites were inseparably bound up with the dynasty of Ahab and because he hoped that by their extermination he would secure the attachment of the far larger and more influential party who worshipped God in Israel. Jehonadab's concurrence must have been given in the belief of his being actuated solely by the highest principles of piety and zeal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Proclaim, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">sanctify</span>.

Originally, it signified a time of repression, or abstention from worldly business; but it had probably grown to mean a day when worldly business was suspended for the sake of a religious gathering.

Jehu then set out to Samaria; and on the way, at the binding-house of the shepherds, he met with the brethren of Ahaziah, who were about to visit their royal relations, and when he learned who they were, had them all seized, viz., forty-two men, and put to death at the cistern of the binding-house. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, "he came and went," appears pleonastic; the words are not to be transposed, however, as Bttcher and Thenius propose after the Syriac, but &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; is added, because Jehu did not go at once to Samaria, but did what follows on the way. By transposing the words, the slaying of the relations of Ahaziah would be transferred to Samaria, in contradiction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>. - The words from &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; onwards, and from &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, are two circumstantial clauses, in which the subject &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is added in the second clause for the sake of greater clearness: "when he was at the binding-house of the shepherds on the road, and Jehu (there) met with the brethren of Ahaziah, he said..." &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1511;&#1491; (&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;, lxx) is explained by Rashi, after the Chaldee &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;, as signifying locus conventus pastorum, the meeting-place of the shepherds; and Gesenius adopts the same view.
