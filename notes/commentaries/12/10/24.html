For as there were divers chambers and rooms built without the temple, belonging to it, for the use of the priests and Levites; so it may probably be conceived that this famous temple of Baal had many such buildings, in some of which the priests of Baal, or of the groves, (whereof there were numbers belonging to the king’s court, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm" title="Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.">1 Kings 18:19</a>,) peradventure might dwell; and others of them might be for divers uses, belonging to the house and service of Baal: and to these buildings the guard might hastily go to surprise and put to death these inferior ministers of Baal, who were there employed in services belonging to that house, or that solemnity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:15-28 Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel.

Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal&#8212;The priests of Baal were clad, probably, in robes of white byssus while they were engaged in the functions of their office, and these were kept under the care of an officer in a particular wardrobe of Baal's temple. This treacherous massacre, and the means taken to accomplish it, are paralleled by the slaughter of the Janissaries and other terrible tragedies in the modern history of the East.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When they went in; </span> when some in the name of the rest went to the altar to offer sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jehu appointed fourscore men; </span> far greater numbers being doubtless in readiness to assist then, in case of any opposition. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,....

Under the pretence of wishing to serve Baal even more than Ahab had done, Jehu appointed a great sacrificial festival for this idol, and had all the worshippers of Baal throughout all the land summoned to attend it; he then placed eighty of his guards around the temple of Baal in which they were assembled, and after the sacrifice was offered, had the priests and worshippers of Baal cut down by them with the sword. Objectively considered, the slaying of the worshippers of Baal was in accordance with the law, and, according to the theocratical principle, was perfectly right; but the subjective motives which impelled Jehu, apart from the artifice, were thoroughly selfish, as Seb. Schmidt has correctly observed. For since the priests and prophets of Baal throughout the Israelitish kingdom were bound up with the dynasty of Ahab, with all their interests and with their whole existence, they might be very dangerous to Jehu, if on any political grounds he should happen not to promote their objects, whereas by their extermination he might hope to draw to his side the whole of the very numerous supporters of the Jehovah-worship, which had formerly been legally established in Israel, and thereby establish his throne more firmly. The very fact that Jehu allowed the calf-worship to continue, is a proof that he simply used religion as the means of securing his own ends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>). &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492; &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>), "sanctify a festal assembly," i.e., proclaim in the land a festal assembly for Baal (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; and for &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, and they proclaimed, sc. the festal meeting. </body></html>
