(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>.) “In primitive times a pillar was the distinguishing mark of a holy place. Idolatrous pillars were commanded to be destroyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm" title="You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but you shall utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.">Exodus 23:24</a>), but most critics think that pillars to Jehovah were quite allowable till the time of Hezekiah or Josiah, to which they assign the Book of Deuteronomy. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21-22</a>.)

The LXX. has the singular here (<span class= "greekheb">τὴν στήλην</span>) and the plural in the next verse. The Syriac has the singular “statue” in both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/10-26.htm" title="And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them....">2 Kings 10:26-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">The images of the house of Baal </span>— A collection of different images. <span class="ital">The image of Baal — </span>The chief image, which they worshipped more than the rest. <span class="ital">And brake down the house of Baal — </span>As, no doubt, they did the rest of the houses of Baal in Israel. <span class="ital">And made it a draught-house — </span>A sink or common shore; that the remembrance of it might be blotted out or made infamous. Thus was the worship of Baal quite destroyed, at least for the present, out of Israel, though it had once prevailed so far, that there were but seven thousand, of all the thousands of Israel, that had not bowed the knee to Baal. Thus will Jehovah, sooner or later, triumph over all the gods of the heathen. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:15-28 Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The images - Or "pillars" of wood.

The same change is also made by R.V. in the next verse. The LXX. has the singular in this verse (<span class="greekheb">στήλην</span>) and the plural in 27. As the worship of Astarte was combined with that of Baal, we can understand that in such a splendid temple as that which Ahab and Jezebel had erected, there would be more pillars (or sacred obelisks) than one, though one would be specially known as ‘the pillar of Baal’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and burnt them</span>] So that these more numerous pillars must have been of wood.

It was a special feature of the Phoenician worship to represent the gods by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, which appear to have been conical stones, or obelisks, destitute of any shaping into the semblance of humanity (see Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 2:3; Damasc. ap. Phot, 'Bibliothec.,' p. 1063; Max. Tyr.,' Diss.,' 38. p. 384). The Phoenicians acknowledged several deities besides Baal, as Ashtoreth, Melkarth, Dagon, Adonis or Tammuz, El, Sadyk, Esmun, and the Kabiri. The "pillars brought forth" may have represented some of these deities, who might all of them be "contemplar" deities with Baal; or they may have been "Baalim," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> forms and aspects of Baal, each the object of some special cult (see Hovers, 'Phonizier,' &sect; 674). And burned them. The "pillars" in this instance were probably, not of stone, but of wood. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Extermination of the Prophets and Priests of Baal and of the Baal-Worship. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-28.htm">2 Kings 10:28</a>. Under the pretence of wishing to serve Baal even more than Ahab had done, Jehu appointed a great sacrificial festival for this idol, and had all the worshippers of Baal throughout all the land summoned to attend it; he then placed eighty of his guards around the temple of Baal in which they were assembled, and after the sacrifice was offered, had the priests and worshippers of Baal cut down by them with the sword. Objectively considered, the slaying of the worshippers of Baal was in accordance with the law, and, according to the theocratical principle, was perfectly right; but the subjective motives which impelled Jehu, apart from the artifice, were thoroughly selfish, as Seb. Schmidt has correctly observed. For since the priests and prophets of Baal throughout the Israelitish kingdom were bound up with the dynasty of Ahab, with all their interests and with their whole existence, they might be very dangerous to Jehu, if on any political grounds he should happen not to promote their objects, whereas by their extermination he might hope to draw to his side the whole of the very numerous supporters of the Jehovah-worship, which had formerly been legally established in Israel, and thereby establish his throne more firmly. The very fact that Jehu allowed the calf-worship to continue, is a proof that he simply used religion as the means of securing his own ends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>). &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492; &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>), "sanctify a festal assembly," i.e., proclaim in the land a festal assembly for Baal (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; and for &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, and they proclaimed, sc. the festal meeting. </body></html>
