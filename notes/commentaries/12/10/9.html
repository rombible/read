When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN.

The speech which Jehu addressed to the spectators was artfully framed to impress their minds with the idea that so wholesale a massacre was the result of the divine judgments denounced on the house of Ahab; and the effect of it was to prepare the public mind for hearing, without horror, of a similar revolting tragedy which was soon after perpetrated, namely, the extinction of all the influential friends and supporters of the dynasty of Ahab, including those of the royal house of Judah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To all the people; </span> either, first, To the promiscuous multitude met there to gaze upon this sad and strange spectacle.

This explication seems probable; only the Hebrew word <span class="ital">ham</span> being generally used of the common people, may seem not so fitly to agree to these rulers and great men, who had brought the heads; and that expression, to all the people, implies that Jehu did not direct his speech to some particular persons, but to the whole body of the people then present, whom he clears from all blame, and to whom he appeals as witnesses between him and these persons. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people,....

He therefore puts them first of all in a good frame of mind towards himself, by acknowledging them to be fit to be arbiters in the case which he is going to put before them. He admits at once that he is as Jezebel had called him ‘the murderer of his master’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-31.htm" title="And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?">2 Kings 9:31</a>), but before them they see the heads of the whole of Ahab’s sons, slain by the rulers of Samaria. ‘Who smote all these?’ he asks, feeling confident that his act will fade into insignificance before the enormity of their greater butchery. And he was not disappointed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who slew</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">smote</span>] <span class="ital">all these?</span>] The verb is not the same as in the previous clause, and the same change is needed in verses 11 and 17.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous.</span> Not an ironical reproach to those who had brought the heads - "Ye consider yourselves righteous, yet this bloodshed rests upon you;" much less a serious declaration (Gerlach) that now at last the sins of idolatrous Israel were atoned for; but an argument ad captandum, addressed to the crowd of spectators whom the unwonted spectacle had brought together, "Ye are just persons, and capable of pronouncing a just judgment; judge, then, if I am the wicked person which men generally consider me." <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</span> I confess to one murder; but here are seventy murders. And who is guilty of them? Not I, or my party, but the trusted adherents of the Ahabite dynasty, the rulers placed by them over the capital, and the governors to whom they had entrusted the royal children. Does not this show that all parties are weary of the Ahabites and of their system? Does it not clear me of any private or selfish motive, and indicate the desire of the whole nation for a change, civil and religions - a change which shall entirely subvert the new religion introduced by Jezebel, and fall back upon the lines of that maintained by Elijah and Elisha? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Extermination of the Seventy Sons of Ahab in Samaria. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1-3</a>. As Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in the wider sense, viz., sons, including grandsons see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm">2 Kings 10:13</a>, as is evident from the fact that &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, foster-fathers, are mentioned, whereas Ahab had been dead fourteen years, and therefore his youngest sons could not have had foster-fathers any longer), Jehu sent a letter to the elders of the city and to the foster-fathers of the princes, to the effect that they were to place one of the sons of their lord upon the throne. There is something very strange in the words &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, "to the princes of Jezreel, the old men," partly on account of the name Jezreel, and partly on account of the combination of &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;. If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, it is evident that &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be the adjective to &#1497;&#1494; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, but denotes the elders of the city, so that the preposition &#1488;&#1500; has dropped out before &#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, the princes or principal men of Jezreel, might certainly be the chief court-officials of the royal house of Ahab, since Ahab frequently resided in Jezreel. But against this supposition there is not only the circumstance that we cannot discover any reason why the court-officials living in Samaria should be called princes of Jezreel, but also <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, where, instead of the princes of Jezreel, the governor of the city and the governor of the castle are mentioned. Consequently there is an error of the text in &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, which ought to read &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, though it is older than the ancient versions, since the Chaldee has the reading &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, and no doubt the Alexandrian translator read the same, as the Septuagint has sometimes &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, like the Vulgate, and sometimes &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, both unquestionably from mere conjecture. The "princes of the city" are, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, the prefect of the palace and the captain of the city; the &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, "elders," the magistrates of Samaria; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the foster-fathers and tutors appointed by Ahab for his sons and grandsons. &#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; is governed freely by &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-2.htm">2 Kings 10:2</a> the words from &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; form an explanatory circumstantial clause: "since the sons of your lord are with you, and with you the war-chariots and horses, and a fortified city and arms," i.e., since you have everything in your hands, - the royal princes and also the power to make one of them king. It is perfectly evident from the words, "the sons of your lord," i.e., of king Joram, that the seventy sons of Ahab included grandsons also. This challenge of Jehu was only a ruse, by which he hoped to discover the feelings of the leading men of the capital of the kingdom, because he could not venture, without being well assured of them, to proceed to Samaria to exterminate the remaining members of the royal family of Ahab who were living there. &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, to fight concerning, i.e., for a person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-17.htm">Judges 9:17</a>. </body></html>
