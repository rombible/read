It was the land east of the Jordan, that is to say, all the land of Gilead, which was the territory of Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh.<p><span class= "bld">From Aroer.</span>—Aroer, now <span class= "ital">‘Arâ‘îr,</span> on the Arnon, was the southern limit of Gilead, which extended northward to Mount Hermon, and included Bashan. “Even (both) Gilead and Bashan,” is added to make it clear that the whole of the land east of the Jordan, and not merely Gilead in the narrower sense, was conquered by Hazael. These conquests of Hazael were characterised by great barbarity. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3-5</a>, and Elisha’s prediction of the same, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm" title="And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.">2Kings 8:12</a>, <span class= "ital">supra</span>.) Ewald thinks Hazael took advantage of the internal troubles at the outset of the reign to effect his conquests. But a man of Jehu’s energy must soon have established domestic tranquillity.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:29-36 It is justly questionable whether Jehu acted from a good principle, and whether he did not take some false steps in doing it; yet no services done for God shall go unrewarded. But true conversion is not only from gross sin, but from all sin; not only from false gods, but from false worships. True conversion is not only from wasteful sins, but from gainful sins; not only from sins which hurt our worldly interests, but from those that support and befriend them; in forsaking which is the great trial whether we can deny ourselves and trust God. Jehu showed great care and zeal for rooting out a false religion, but in the true religion he cared not, took no heed to please God and do his duty. Those that are heedless, it is to be feared, are graceless. The people were also careless, therefore it is not strange that in those days the Lord began to cut Israel short. They were short in their duty to God, therefore God cut them short in their extent, wealth, and power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The loss of the entire trans-Jordanic territory seems to be intended, or at any rate its complete ruin and devastation (compare marginal reference "y").

Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam &#8230; Jehu departed not from after them&#8212;Jehu had no intention of carrying his zeal for the Lord beyond a certain point, and as he considered it impolitic to encourage his subjects to travel to Jerusalem, he re-established the symbolic worship of the calves.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> From Jordan eastward, to wit, from the land of Canaan. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>From Jordan eastward,.... This was principally the coast on which Hazael smote them, to the east of the land of Canaan: <p>all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Moabites; the country on the other side Jordan, given to these tribes by Moses, at their request, which were before the kingdoms of Sihon and of Og: <p>from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan: countries which the Israelites first conquered, and were the first they lost. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">Gilead</span>] This country lay between Bashan on the north, and Moab and Ammon on the south. It was of a mountainous character, and was chosen by the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh because it was so well adapted for the pasturage of their numerous flocks. These tribes were all included at this time in Hazael’s conquest, and so the phrase ‘cut Israel short’ was fully borne out, for one quarter of the whole ten tribes was thus taken from her.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Aroer</span>] This city was on the south boundary of the tribe of Reuben, which was the southernmost of the three trans-Jordanic tribes. Thus it marks the extreme limit in that direction of the conquests here mentioned, while Bashan marks that on the north. Nothing was left to Israel, east of the Jordan, for Bashan was the northern part of the land assigned to the half tribe of Manasseh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Arnon</span>] This torrent bed, full of water in the rainy season, but dry in summer, after the character of all the clefts in the east of Jordan, is wrongly described by ‘river’ of A.V.

It formed the border between Israel and Moab.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Bashan</span>] This district, which like Gilead was mountainous, lay between Gilead and Mt Hermon. It was well wooded also. ‘The oaks of Bashan’ are frequently mentioned, and so are the cattle, the ‘fat bulls of Bashan’. The loss of such a district must have been very fatal to Israel. After this notice Bashan, which in the early days is often spoken of in connexion with Og, the king whom the Israelites vanquished on entering the land, disappears from the Bible history. Hazael’s conquest was never recovered.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Jordan eastward.</span> The territory west of the Jordan was not attacked at this time. Hazael's expeditious were directed against the trans-Jordanic region, the seats of the three tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh. This tract was far easier of access than the other, and was more tempting, being the richest part of Palestine. The region comprised <span class="cmt_word">all the land of Gilead</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the more southern region, reaching from the borders of Moab on the south to the Hieromax or Sheriat-el-Mandhur upon the north, the proper land of the <span class="cmt_word">Gadites, and the Reubenites, and</span> [a portion of] <span class="cmt_word">the Manassites</span> - together with Bashan, the more northern region, which belonged wholly to Manasseh - <span class="cmt_word">from Aroer</span> (now Arair), <span class="cmt_word">which is by the river Arnon</span> - the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Mojeb</span>, which was the boundary between Israel and Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13, 24</a>), both in the earlier and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>) in the later times - <span class="cmt_word">even Gilead and Bashan.</span> There is other evidence, besides this, that Hazael was one of the most warlike of the Syrian kings. We find him, on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser II., mentioned as a stubborn adversary of the Assyrian arms. In the seventeenth campaign of Shalmaneser, a great battle was fought between the two monarchs. Hazael brought into the field more than twelve hundred chariots, but was defeated, and obliged to retreat, his camp falling into the hands of the enemy ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 84). Four years later Shalmaneser invaded Hazael's territory, and took, according to his own account (ibid., p. 35), four cities or fortresses belonging to him. He does not claim, however, to have made him a tributary; and By his later annals it is evident that he avoided further contest, preferring to turn his arms in other directions. (On Hazael's campaign in Philistia, and designs against Jerusalem, see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17, 18</a>,) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Lastly, they destroyed the temple itself and made it &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, privies, for which the Masoretes have substituted the euphemistic &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, sinks, as a mark of the greatest insult, many examples of which are to be met with among Oriental tribes (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-11.htm">Ezra 6:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a>, and Haevernick in loc.). - Thus Jehu exterminated Baal from Israel. This remark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-28.htm">2 Kings 10:28</a> forms the introduction to the history of Jehu's reign, with which the last epoch in the history of the ten tribes begins. </body></html>
