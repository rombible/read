Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness from that which is the cause of all misery?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A fenced city - Or, "fenced cities."

Jehu Causes Seventy of Ahab's Children to Be Beheaded.<p>1-4. Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria&#8212;As it appears (2Ki 10:13), that grandsons are included it is probable that this number comprehended the whole posterity of Ahab. Their being all assembled in that capital might arise from their being left there on the king's departure for Ramoth-gilead, or from their taking refuge in some of the strongholds of that city on the news of Jehu's conspiracy. It may be inferred from the tenor of Jehu's letters that their first intention was to select the fittest of the royal family and set him up as king. Perhaps this challenge of Jehu was designed as a stroke of policy on his part to elicit their views, and to find out whether they were inclined to be pacific or hostile. The bold character of the man, and the rapid success of his conspiracy, terrified the civic authorities of Samaria and Jezreel into submission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you,....

There is no public post. Kings and private individuals must equally find persons who will undertake to carry and deliver their despatches. Even the post organized by Darius Hystaspis was not one that went daily, but only one kept ready for the king to use when he had occasion for it. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing your master's sons are with you.</span> "Your master's sons" must mean Joram's sons; by which we learn that, unlike his brother Ahaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>), Joram had male offspring who survived him, and were now with the rest of Ahab's descendants, at Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the chariots</span>, <span class="accented">and the horses</span>, <span class="accented">a fenced city also</span>, <span class="accented">and the armor</span>. The main chariot force of the country, and the chief arsenal, containing both armor and arms, were naturally at Samaria, the capital, and might thus be regarded as at the disposition of the Samaritan municipality. Jehu scornfully challenges them to make use of their resources against him. He is quite ready for a contest. Let them do their worst. The LXX. have "fenced cities" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) instead of "a fenced city;" but the existing Hebrew text is probably right Samaria was the only fortified town in their possession. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Jehu did not deign to answer the worthless woman; he simply looked up to the window and inquired: "Who is (holds) with me? who?" Then two, three chamberlains looked out (of the side windows), and by Jehu's command threw the proud queen out of the window, so that some of her blood spirted upon the wall and the horses (of Jehu), and Jehu trampled her down, driving over her with his horses and chariot. </body></html>
