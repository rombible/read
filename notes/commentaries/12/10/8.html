Josephus says Jehu was giving a banquet.<p><span class= "bld">Heaps.</span>—The noun (<span class= "ital">çibbûr</span>) occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament. In the Talmud it means “congregation,” as we say colloquially “a <span class= "ital">heap</span> of persons.” The verb (<span class= "ital">çābar</span>) means “to heap up.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-10.htm" title="And he said, To morrow.

But perhaps not the city gate, but the gate of the palace is to be understood. Parallels to this deed of Jehu are not wanting in the history of modern Persia.

Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness from that which is the cause of all misery?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two heaps - Probably placed one on either side of the gateway, to strike terror into the partisans of the late dynasty as they passed in and out of the town. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Perhaps this messenger to Jehu came from the great men of Samaria themselves, to let him know that they had obeyed his orders: <p>and he said, lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning; very probably it was towards or at the evening they were brought; and he ordered them to be taken out of the baskets, and laid in two heaps at the entering of the gate of the city, that they might be taken notice of, and publicly viewed by the people that passed and repassed the gate; and where they met in great numbers, either on account of the market there, or court of judicature there held, especially in mornings; and here they were to remain till the morning, though not without a guard, that they might still be more exposed to view; Noldius (p) renders it, "without the door of the gate", for they were brought at night, when the gate was shut. <p>(p) Ebr.

As Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in the wider sense, viz., sons, including grandsons see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm">2 Kings 10:13</a>, as is evident from the fact that &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, foster-fathers, are mentioned, whereas Ahab had been dead fourteen years, and therefore his youngest sons could not have had foster-fathers any longer), Jehu sent a letter to the elders of the city and to the foster-fathers of the princes, to the effect that they were to place one of the sons of their lord upon the throne. There is something very strange in the words &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, "to the princes of Jezreel, the old men," partly on account of the name Jezreel, and partly on account of the combination of &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;. If we compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, it is evident that &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be the adjective to &#1497;&#1494; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, but denotes the elders of the city, so that the preposition &#1488;&#1500; has dropped out before &#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, the princes or principal men of Jezreel, might certainly be the chief court-officials of the royal house of Ahab, since Ahab frequently resided in Jezreel. But against this supposition there is not only the circumstance that we cannot discover any reason why the court-officials living in Samaria should be called princes of Jezreel, but also <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, where, instead of the princes of Jezreel, the governor of the city and the governor of the castle are mentioned. Consequently there is an error of the text in &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, which ought to read &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, though it is older than the ancient versions, since the Chaldee has the reading &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, and no doubt the Alexandrian translator read the same, as the Septuagint has sometimes &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, like the Vulgate, and sometimes &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, both unquestionably from mere conjecture. The "princes of the city" are, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, the prefect of the palace and the captain of the city; the &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, "elders," the magistrates of Samaria; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the foster-fathers and tutors appointed by Ahab for his sons and grandsons. &#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; is governed freely by &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-2.htm">2 Kings 10:2</a> the words from &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; form an explanatory circumstantial clause: "since the sons of your lord are with you, and with you the war-chariots and horses, and a fortified city and arms," i.e., since you have everything in your hands, - the royal princes and also the power to make one of them king. It is perfectly evident from the words, "the sons of your lord," i.e., of king Joram, that the seventy sons of Ahab included grandsons also. This challenge of Jehu was only a ruse, by which he hoped to discover the feelings of the leading men of the capital of the kingdom, because he could not venture, without being well assured of them, to proceed to Samaria to exterminate the remaining members of the royal family of Ahab who were living there. &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, to fight concerning, i.e., for a person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-17.htm">Judges 9:17</a>. </body></html>
