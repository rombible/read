So all the versions except the LXX. The open assassination of the king is noted, in contrast with the secrecy with which former conspiracies had been concerted. It is a symptom of the rapidly-increasing corruption of morals, which allowed people to look on with indifference while the king was being murdered. (The LXX. puts the Hebrew words into Greek letters thus: <span class= "greekheb">κεβλααμ</span><span class= "ital">.</span> The word <span class= "ital">qobol</span>—“before”—is Aramaic rather than Hebrew, and only occurs here.

Zechariah's Reign over Israel.<p>8-10. In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel&#8212;There was an interregnum from some unknown cause between the reign of Jeroboam and the accession of his son, which lasted, according to some, for ten or twelve years, according to others, for twenty-two years, or more. This prince pursued the religious policy of the calf-worship, and his reign was short, being abruptly terminated by the hand of violence. In his fate was fulfilled the prophecy addressed to Jehu (2Ki 10:30; also Ho 1:4), that his family would possess the throne of Israel for four generations; and accordingly Jehoahaz, Joash, Jehoram, and Zechariah were his successors&#8212;but there his dynasty terminated; and perhaps it was the public knowledge of this prediction that prompted the murderous design of Shallum.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shallum the son of Jabesh; </span> one of his chief captains. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before the people</span> openly and impudently; which he presumed to do, either because he remembered that the promise of the kingdom made to Jehu was confined to the fourth generation, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-30.htm" title="And the LORD said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.">2 Kings 10:30</a></span>, which he observed to be now expired; or because he perceived that the people were generally disaffected to their king, and favourable to his attempt. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him,....

Hence it would seem that the conspiracy of Shallum had large popular support. But the LXX. here has plural verbs ‘<span class="ital">they</span> conspired’, ‘<span class="ital">they</span> smote’ and ‘<span class="ital">they</span> slew’ and writes the two words translated ‘before the people’ as though they were one proper name <span class="greekheb">Κεβλαὰμ</span>. Hence some have thought that Shallum had a fellow-conspirator of whom this was the name. The words occur in such a combination and sense nowhere else, and the preposition, rendered ‘before’, is not found except in the Chaldee portions of the Old Testament. But there is nothing in the Hebrew to warrant the changes of the LXX., though Ewald, and after him the late Dean Stanley, adopted them as representing a more correct text. Stanley says (<span class="ital">Jewish Church</span> 2:308) ‘Zechariah was, it would seem, succeeded by a king, whose very name is almost lost to us, Kobolam, and Kobolam was succeeded by Shallum’. There needs a great deal of manipulation of even the text of the LXX. to extract any such statement from it. A much more reasonable conjecture is to make <span class="greekheb">Κεβλαὰμ</span> (though found nowhere else) the name of the place where Zachariah was murdered.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him.</span> Josephus calls Shallum Zachariah's "friend," but otherwise adds nothing to the present narrative. <span class="cmt_word">And smote him before the people.</span> The phrase employed is very unusual, and has justly excited suspicion. It was not understood by the LXX., who translate <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>, which gives no sense. Ewald sought to solve the difficulty by inventing a king, "Zobolam," but other critics have found this expedient too bold. The rendering of our translators is generally accepted, though <span class="accented">qobal</span>, "before," only occurs here and in Daniel. If we accept this rendering, we must suppose that the act of violence was done openly, like Jehu's murder of Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">And slew him, and reigned in his stead</span> (comp. ver. 13). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Beside the general characteristics of Uzziah's fifty-two years' reign, which are given in the standing formula, not a single special act is mentioned, although, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26</a>, he raised his kingdom to great earthly power and prosperity; probably for no other reason than because his enterprises had exerted no permanent influence upon the development of the kingdom of Judah, but all the useful fruits of his reign were destroyed again by the ungodly Ahaz. Uzziah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done. For as the latter was unfaithful to the Lord in the closing years of his reign, so did Uzziah seek God only so long as Zechariah, who was experienced in divine visions, remained alive, and God gave success to his enterprises, so that during this time he carried on successful wars against the Philistines and Arabians, fortified the walls of Jerusalem with strong towers, built watch-towers in the desert, and constructed cisterns for the protection and supply of his numerous flocks, promoted agriculture and vine-growing, and organized a numerous and well-furnished army (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5-15</a>). But the great power to which he thereby attained produced such haughtiness, that he wanted to make himself high priest in his kingdom after the manner of the heathen kings, and usurping the sacred functions, which belonged according to the law to the Levitical priests alone, to offer incense in the temple, for which he was punished with leprosy upon the spot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-5.htm">2 Kings 15:5</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>.). The king's leprosy is described in our account also as a punishment from God. &#1497;&#1497; &#1493;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;: Jehovah smote him, and he became leprous. This presupposes an act of guilt, and confirms the fuller account of this guilt given in the Chronicles, which Thenius, following the example of De Wette and Winer, could only call in question on the erroneous assumption "that the powerful king wanted to restore the regal high-priesthood exercised by David and Solomon" Oehler (Herzog's Cycl.) has already shown that such an opinion is perfectly "groundless," since it is nowhere stated that David and Solomon performed with their own hands the functions assigned in the law to the priests in connection with the offering of sacrifice, as the co-operation of the priests is not precluded in connection with the sacrifices presented by these kings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>, etc.). - Uzziah being afflicted with leprosy, was obliged to live in a separate house, and appoint his son Jotham as president of the royal house to judge the people, i.e., to conduct the administration of the kingdom. - The time when this event occurred is not stated either in our account or in the Chronicles. But this punishment from God cannot have fallen upon him before the last ten years of his fifty-two years' reign, because his son, who was only twenty-five years old when his father died (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-33.htm">2 Kings 15:33</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-1.htm">2 Chronicles 27:1</a>), undertook the administration of the affairs of the kingdom at once, and therefore must have been at least fifteen years old. &#1492;&#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is taken by Winer, Gesenius, and others, after the example of Iken, to signify nosocomium, an infirmary or lazar-house, in accordance with the verb Arab. xfs&#774;, fecit, II debilis, imbecillis fuit. But this meaning cannot be traced in Hebrew, where &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is used in no other sense than free, set at liberty, manumissus. Consequently the rendering adopted by Aquila is correct, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;; and the explanation given by Kimchi of this epithet is, that the persons who lived there were those who were sent away from human society, or perhaps more correctly, those who were released from the world and its privileges and duties, or cut off from intercourse with God and man.</body></html>
