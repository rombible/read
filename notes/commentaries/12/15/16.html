The course of events was apparently this: after slaying Shallum, Menahem returned to Tirzah, and set out thence at the head of his entire army to bring the rest of the country to acknowledge him as king. Tiphsah resisting his claims, he made an example of it which proved efficient to terrorise other towns into submission.

The place there intended is Thapsacus on the west side of the Euphrates, and is famous in classic history as the point at which Cyrus with his 10000 Greeks crossed that river. If that be the place here spoken of, we must understand Menahem to have carried his victorious arms from Samaria to the Euphrates. For a king who had put himself on the throne by force, at a time when Israel was thoroughly disorganised, this seems inconceivable. For this reason most people consider the place here mentioned to have been within the kingdom of Israel. Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> IX. 11. 1) calls it Thapsa, and speaks of it as a place which refused to admit the usurper. If this be so, it is mentioned nowhere else, and this seems to be by far the most natural explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the coasts</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">borders</span>] <span class="ital">thereof</span>] That is, all the country round about this offending town.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from Tirzah</span>] Menahem’s proceeding appears to have been this.

At a time when the king was changing every few months the citizens might naturally feel unwilling to admit a new claimant for the rule, till they were certain of what was happening elsewhere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ript up</span>] This savage conduct is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm" title="And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.">2 Kings 8:12</a>) among the enormities which Hazael was likely to perpetrate, and in the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-16.htm" title="Samaria shall become desolate; for she has rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.">Hosea 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:">Amos 1:13</a>) it is specified as part of the sufferings of Samaria from her invaders, and as inflicted by the Ammonites on the women of Gilead. But nowhere except here do we find such cruelty exercised by an Israelite. It marks the time as one of great degradation and barbarity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-22.</span> - REIGN OF MENAHEM, AND EXPEDITION OF PUL AGAINST SAMARIA. Two events only of Menahem's reign receive notice from the writer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> His capture of Tiphsah, and severe treatment of the inhabitants (ver. 16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The invasion of his land by an Assyrian monarch, called "Pul" or "Phul," and his submission to that monarch's authority. Pul's retirement was bought by a large sum of money, which Menahem collected from his subjects (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Menahem smote Tiphsah.</span> The only town of this name known to history or geography is the famous city on the Euphrates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>), called by the Greeks Thapsacus. It has been thought that Menahem could not have pushed his conquests so far, and a second Tiphsah has been invented in the Israelite highland, between Tirzah and Samaria, of which there is no other notice anywhere. But "Tiphsah," which means "passage" or "fordway," is an unsuitable name for a city in such a situation. The view of Keil is clearly tenable - that Zachariah had intended to carry on his father's warlike policy, and had collected an army for a great Eastern expedition, which had its head-quarters at the royal city of Tirzah, and was under the command of Menahem. As the expedition was about to start, the news came that Shallum had murdered Zachariah and usurped the throne. Menahem upon this proceeded from Tirzah to Samaria, crushed Shallum, and, returning to his army, carried out without further delay the expedition already resolved upon. The Assyrian records show that, at the probable date of the expedition, Assyria was exceptionally weak, and in no condition to resist an attack, though a little later, under Tiglath-pileser, she recovered herself<span class="cmt_word">. And all that were therein, and the coasts thereof, from Tirzah.</span> "From Tirzah" means "starting from Tir-zah," as in ver. 14. It is to be connected with "smote," not with "coasts." Because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it. Determined resistance on the part of a city summoned to surrender has always been regarded as justifying an extreme severity of treatment. It is not clear that Menahem transgressed the ordinary usages of war in what he did, however much he transgressed the laws of humanity. <span class="cmt_word">And all the women therein that were with child he ripped up</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, with the comment; and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Zechariah also persevered in the sin of his fathers in connection with the calf-worship therefore the word of the Lord pronounced upon Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>) was fulfilled in him. - Shallum the son of Jabesh formed a conspiracy and put him to death &#1511;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501;, before people, i.e., openly before the eyes of all.<p>(Note: Ewald in the most marvellous manner has made &#1511;&#1489;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501; into a king (Gesch. iii. p. 598).)<p>As Israel would not suffer itself to be brought to repentance and to return to the Lord, its God and King, by the manifestations of divine grace in the times of Joash and Jeroboam, any more than by the severe judgments that preceded them, and the earnest admonitions of the prophets Hosea and Amos; the judgment of rejection could not fail eventually to burst forth upon the nation, which so basely despised the grace, long-suffering, and covenant-faithfulness of God. We therefore see the kingdom hasten with rapid steps towards its destruction after the death of Jeroboam. In the sixty-two years between the death of Jeroboam and the conquest of Samaria by Shalmaneser anarchy prevailed twice, in all for the space of twenty years, and six kings followed one another, only one of whom, viz., Menahem, died a natural death, so as to be succeeded by his son upon the throne. The other five were dethroned and murdered by rebels, so that, as Witsius has truly said, with the murder of Zachariah not only was the declaration of Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>) fulfilled, "I visit the blood-guiltiness of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu," but also the parallel utterance, "and I destroy the kingdom of the house of Israel," since the monarchy in Israel really ceased with Zachariah. "For the successors of Zachariah were not so much kings as robbers and tyrants, unworthy of the august name of kings, who lost with ignominy the tyranny which they had wickedly acquired, and as wickedly exercised." - Witsius, &#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;. p. 320. </body></html>
