The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men.

Three verses suffice for the reign of Shallum, the son of Jabesh, who held the throne for only thirty days. Hearing of his conspiracy, Menahem, the son of Gadi - "the general," as Josephus calls him ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:11. &sect; 1) - marched from Tirzah to Samaria, got Shallum into his power, and put him to death (ver. 14). The writer concludes with the usual formula (ver. 15). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah King of Judah.</span> This date follows from that of ver. 8, and must stand or fall with it.

His son Jotham did not become king till after Uzziah's death, as he had not been regent, but only the administrator of the affairs of the kingdom during his father's leprosy. </body></html>
