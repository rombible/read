The marginal rendering, “Let not the Lord help thee!”—i.e., “May the Lord destroy thee!” would be possible in another context. Another rendering is, “Nay (i.e., do not supplicate me), let the Lord help thee!”<p><span class= "bld">Out of the barnfloor.</span>—Comp. Hosea ix 2.: “The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.” Jehoram, in the irony of despair, reminds the woman of what she well knows—viz., that the corn and wine, the staple foods of the time, are long since exhausted. The words, “If the Lord do not help thee,” may be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-10.htm" title="And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!">2Kings 3:10</a>, “Alas! that the Lord hath called,” &c. The character of Jehoram is consistently drawn. But perhaps the point is: “Jehovah alone is the giver of corn and wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/2-8.htm" title="For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.">Hosea 2:8-9</a>).

The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If the Lord do not help - The translation in the text is decidedly better than the marginal rendering. Some prefer to render - "Nay ... let Jehovah help thee.

So they are words of impatience, and rage, and a formal curse, wishing that God would not help her, as he could not, as Josephus, amongst others, understand it; which agrees too well with the character of the man, an infidel, and an idolater, and a wicked man, and at this time in a great rage, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-31.htm" title="Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.">2 Kings 6:31</a></span>. Or they may be rendered thus, No; (as this Hebrew particle is sometimes used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm" title="He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.">Job 20:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-5.htm" title="He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.">Psalm 24:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-2.htm" title="The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed on the earth: and you will not deliver him to the will of his enemies.">Psalm 41:2</a> 50:3 <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm" title="Let not mercy and truth forsake you: bind them about your neck; write them on the table of your heart:">Proverbs 3:3</a>,5 31:4</span>) <span class="ital">let the Lord help thee</span>. So it may be taken, either, first, As a direction: No; do not cry to me, but to God, for help: God help thee, for I cannot. Or rather, secondly, As a profane scoff: No; come not to me, but go to him to whom Elisha directs you; pray to the Lord: you see how ready he is to help you, by his suffering you to come to this extremity; wait upon God for relief, as Elisha adviseth me; but I will wait no longer for him, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-33.htm" title="And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?">2 Kings 6:33</a></span>, and I will take a course with Elisha for thus abusing both me and my people with vain hopes. Or thus, <span class="ital">The Lord</span> (on whom forsooth thou and I are commanded to wait for help) <span class="ital">will not help thee</span>, as he could easily do, and would do, if he were so good as Elisha pretends; <span class="ital">whence</span> then<span class="ital"> shall I help thee</span>? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of the barn-floor, or out of the winepress?</span> Dost thou ask of me corn or wine, which I want for myself? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, if the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee?.... Mistaking her meaning, as if she prayed him to relieve her hunger; the margin of our Bible is, "let not the Lord save thee"; and so some understand it as a wish that she might perish; and so Josephus (o), that being wroth, he cursed her in the name of God: <p>out of the barn floor, or out of the winepress? when neither of them afforded anything; no corn was to be had from the one, nor wine from the other, no, not for his own use, and therefore how could he help her out of either? <p>(o) Ut supra.

If <span class="ital">the Lord do not help thee</span>] There is some difficulty here. The word rendered ‘if … not’ is that which in Hebrew is generally put with an imperative = ‘Let not’. So that the sense would be ‘May the Lord not help thee’. So the LXX. But such a wish could hardly have come at such a time into the king’s mind. The R.V. (marg.) attempts to keep the imperative force thus, ‘Nay, let the Lord help thee’. This comes a little nearer the sense of the English versions. But there is no warrant for separating the negative particle in this way from its verb. Perhaps it is best to explain the negative particle, as if the verb belonging to it were suppressed. Thus ‘Do not (cry to me); the Lord must help thee; for I cannot’. In this way the sense given in the English versions would be the correct force of the words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?</span>] i.e. with anything to eat or to drink. The supply of both was utterly spent, as the whole city knew.

The object of the miracle would have been frustrated if the Syrians had been slain. For the intention was to show the Syrians that they had to do with a prophet of the true God, against whom no human power could be of any avail, that they might learn to fear the almighty God. Even when regarded from a political point of view, the prophet's advice was more likely to ensure peace than the king's proposal, as the result of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-23.htm">2 Kings 6:23</a> clearly shows. The Syrians did not venture any more to invade the land of Israel with flying parties, from fear of the obvious protection of Israel by its God; though this did not preclude a regular war, like that related in the following account.
