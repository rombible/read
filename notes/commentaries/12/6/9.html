This is supported by the LXX., “<span class= "greekheb">ὅτι ἐκεῖ Συρία κέκρυπται</span>;” the Syriac and Arabic, “are lurking;” the Vulg., “in insidiis sunt;” and the Targum, “are hidden.” But the word (Heb.) is really an irregular participial formation from nahath, “to descend,” and the Authorised Version is therefore correct. The versions have deduced the idea of hiding from that of going down, as if crouching on the ground were meant.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-12 The king of Israel regarded the warnings Elisha gave him, of danger from the Syrians, but would not heed the warnings of danger from his sins.

Elisha apprised King Jehoram of the secret purpose of the enemy; so, by adopting precautionary measures, he was always enabled to anticipate and defeat their attacks. The frequency of his disappointments having led the Syrian king to suspect some of his servants of carrying on a treacherous correspondence with the enemy, he was informed about Elisha, whose apprehension he forthwith determined to effect. This resolution was, of course, grounded on the belief that however great the knowledge of Elisha might be, if seized and kept a prisoner, he could no longer give information to the king of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel,....

Elisha did not suffer his hostile feeling towards Jehoram personally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-13.htm">2 Kings 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-8.htm">2 Kings 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>) to interfere with his patriotism. When disaster threatened his country, he felt it incumbent on him to warn even an ungodly king. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elisha Causes an Iron Axe to Float. - The following account gives us an insight into the straitened life of the pupils of the prophets. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1-4</a>. As the common dwelling-place had become too small for them, they resolved, with Elisha's consent, to build a new house, and went, accompanied by the prophet, to the woody bank of the Jordan to fell the wood that was required for the building. The place where the common abode had become too small is not given, but most of the commentators suppose it to have been Gilgal, chiefly from the erroneous assumption that the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a> was in the Jordan valley to the east of Jericho. Thenius only cites in support of this the reference in &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (dwell with thee) to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>; but this decides nothing, as the pupils of the prophets sat before Elisha, or gathered together around their master in a common home, not merely in Gilgal, but also in Bethel and Jericho. We might rather think of Jericho, since Bethel and Gilgal (Jiljilia) were so far distant from the Jordan, that there is very little probability that a removal of the meeting-place to the Jordan, such as is indicated by &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, would ever have been thought of from either of these localities. </body></html>
