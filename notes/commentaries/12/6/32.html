The elders, who were the nobles and chiefs of Samaria, were gathered round him in his house to learn the will of Jehovah, and to receive comfort and counsel from his lips.

At the same time, we must not forget the idiom by which a man is called a <span class= "ital">son</span> of any quality or disposition which he evinces. (Comp. “son of Belial,” “sons of pride,” “sons of wickedness;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,">2Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-34.htm" title="He beholds all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.">Job 41:34</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Hold him fast at the door.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">press him back with the door.</span> The door opened <span class= "ital">inwards</span>, and the prophet bade his friends the elders hold the door against the messenger of death.<p><span class= "bld">Is not the sound . . . behind him?</span>—Elisha’s reason for bidding the elders hold the door.

For though Jehoram was a wicked man, and most of his officers, probably, as wicked as himself; yet, as Poole justly observes, we cannot doubt but there were some among them whom his holy life, powerful ministry, and glorious miracles, with the great benefits procured by him for the public, had won to God and the true religion; at least to the profession of it, among whom Jehu might be one; and these were here sitting with him, either to receive counsel and comfort from him in this distressing time, or to solicit him to use his power with God for their relief; which he accordingly did, and pronounced the joyful news which follows in the beginning of the next chapter. <span class="ital">The king sent a man before him — </span>One of his guard, or some other officer, to <span class="ital">take away his head, </span>as it follows. <span class="ital">But ere the messenger came, he said, </span>&c. — Being admonished by God of his danger. <span class="ital">See how this son of a murderer — </span>The genuine son of that wicked Ahab, the murderer of the Lord’s prophets.

The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord.

But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him&#8212;The latter clause of 2Ki 6:33, which contains the king's impatient exclamation, enables us to account for the impetuous order he issued for the beheading of Elisha. Though Jehoram was a wicked king and most of his courtiers would resemble their master, many had been won over, through the prophet's influence, to the true religion. A meeting, probably a prayer-meeting, of those was held in the house where he lodged, for he had none of his own (1Ki 19:20, 21); and them he not only apprised of the king's design against himself, but disclosed to them the proof of a premeditated deliverance.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In his house; </span> in the house where he lodged; for he had no house of his own, having forsaken all when he followed Elijah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-20.htm" title="And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.

The literal rendering is given on the margin of R.V., ‘Thrust him back with the door’. The doors in Oriental houses mostly opened outwards, so that if pushed from within they would come against any one that stood on the outside, and drive him backwards. Beside knowing of the king’s threat, Elisha seems to have been aware that he had almost immediately changed his purpose, and was hurrying after the messenger to prevent his order from being executed. Hence he explains to the elders that the king’s footsteps are to be heard close upon those of his servant. When they supposed, as they would from the fulfilment of the first part of his words, that Elisha knew exactly what was coming, they would be ready, although they were Jehoram’s servants, to stop the messenger so long as to see whether the king did really arrive. That the king did come we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-17.htm" title="And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.">2 Kings 7:17</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him.</span> It is best to translate, <span class="accented">Now Elisha was sitting in his house</span>, <span class="accented">and the elders were sitting with him</span>, <span class="accented">when the king sent a man from before him</span>. Elisha had a house in Samaria, where he ordinarily resided, and from which he made his circuits. He happened to be sitting there, and the elders of the city to be sitting with him, when Jehoram sent "a man from before him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of the court officials, to put him to death. The "elders" had probably assembled at Elisha's house to consult with him on the critical situation of affairs, and (if possible) obtain from him some miraculous assistance. <span class="cmt_word">But ere the messenger came to him; he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head</span>; Elisha was supernaturally warned of what was about to take place - that an executioner was coming almost immediately to take away his life, and that the king himself would arrive shortly after. He calls the king "this son of a murderer," or rather "this son of <span class="accented">the</span> murderer," with reference to Ahab, the great murderer of the time, who had sanctioned all Jezebel's cruelties-the general massacre of the prophets of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>), the judicial murder of Naboth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9-13</a>), the attempt to kill Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>) - and had, by a fierce and long continued persecution, reduced the worshippers of Jehovah in Israel to the scanty number of seven thousand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). Jehoram had now shown that he inherited the bloodthirsty disposition of his father, and had justly earned the epithet which Elisha bestowed on him. <span class="cmt_word">Look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door.</span> Keil renders the last clause, "force him back at the door;" the LXX.

He could not in a general way have expected them to resist the king's will as declared by his representative; but he might reasonably ask a short respite, if the king was just about to arrive at the house, to confirm the order that he had given, or to revoke it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the king was passing by upon the wall to conduct the defence, a woman cried to him for help; whereupon he replied: &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1498; &#1497;&#1497;, "should Jehovah not help thee, whence shall I help thee? from the threshing-floor or from the wine-press?"
