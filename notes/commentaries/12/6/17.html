As fiery chariots and horses parted Elijah from Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm" title="And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.">2Kings 2:12</a>), so now a similar appearance surrounds and protects the latter. “It is a fine thought,” says Thenius, “that on this occasion the veil of earthly existence was lifted for a moment for one child of man, so as to allow him a clear glimpse of the sovereignty of Providence.” The form of the supernatural appearance was, no doubt, conditioned by the circumstances of the time. Chariots and horses were the strength of the Aramean oppressors of Israel; therefore, Jehovah causes His earthly ministers to see that He also has at His command horses and chariots, and that <span class= "ital">of fire</span>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm" title="And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray you, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.">2 Kings 6:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes — </span>The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger; Lord, said the prophet, open the eyes of his faith, and the eyes of his mind, that with them he may see the protection we are under, may see the invisible guard of heavenly beings which encompass and defend us. Angels, whether they be purely spiritual, or clothed with some material vehicle, it is allowed, cannot be seen by mortal eyes: and, therefore, as the prophet himself would not have seen them, unless God by a miracle had rendered them visible to his eyes, so he requests of God that, for the causes above mentioned, he would vouchsafe to his servant the same privilege. <span class="ital">And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire — </span>Fire is both dreadful and devouring: that power, which was engaged for Elisha, could both terrify and consume the assailants. <span class="ital">Round about Elisha — </span>The mountains, which were full of these fiery chariots and horses, were round about the city, and therefore round about Elisha, who was within it: or he saw, as if he, Elisha, was in the midst of a glorious camp of angels, who defended him so that nothing could penetrate and break through unto him. “The opening of our eyes,” says Henry, “will be the silencing of our fears. In the dark we are most apt to be frightened. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of heaven, the less we shall fear the calamities of this earth.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:13-23 What Elisha said to his servant is spoken to all the faithful servants of God, when without are fightings, and within are fears. Fear not, with that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are with us, to protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroy us. The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger. Lord, open the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thy protecting hand. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of Heaven, the less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the god of this world, blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their own ruin; but when God enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in the midst of their enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell, though, before, they thought their condition good. When Elisha had the Syrians at his mercy, he made it appear that he was influenced by Divine goodness as well as Divine power. Let us not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. The Syrians saw it was to no purpose to try to assault so great and so good a man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Open his eyes that he may see - Elisha's servant lacked the faith of his master. Elisha therefore prays that he may be given a vision of the spiritual world, and see, as if with the bodily eye, the angelic host (marginal references) which he himself knows to be present. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see&#8212;The invisible guard of angels that encompass and defend us (Ps 34:7). The opening of the eyes, which Elisha prayed for, were those of the Spirit, not of the body&#8212;the eye of faith sees the reality of the divine presence and protection where all is vacancy or darkness to the ordinary eye. The horses and chariots were symbols of the divine power (see on [331]2Ki 2:12); and their fiery nature denoted their supernatural origin; for fire, the most ethereal of earthly elements, is the most appropriate symbol of the Godhead [Keil].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That he may see; </span> that by some visible appearance he may see the invisible guard of angels which encompass and defend us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Chariots of fire; </span> which is useful, both for defence to those that are surrounded by it, and offence to the enemies who shall attempt to break through it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Round about Elisha:</span> either the mountains were round about the city, and therefore round about Elisha, who was within it; or he saw in a vision Elisha upon the mountain encompassed with fiery horses and chariots. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see,....

It is not that the troops may be gathered that Elisha prays, they are there already, but that the servant may have a seeing eye bestowed upon him to discern how well he and his master are protected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the mountain was full</span> of <span class="ital">horses and chariots of fire</span>] Just as in chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.">2 Kings 2:11</a> we read of appearances so described.

His mental state required something like a material manifestation; and hence Elisha prays that he may be permitted to behold the angelic host, which everywhere throughout creation is employed at all times in doing the will of God, and accomplishing his ends (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, etc.).
