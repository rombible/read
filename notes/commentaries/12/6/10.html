Elisha apprised King Jehoram of the secret purpose of the enemy; so, by adopting precautionary measures, he was always enabled to anticipate and defeat their attacks. The frequency of his disappointments having led the Syrian king to suspect some of his servants of carrying on a treacherous correspondence with the enemy, he was informed about Elisha, whose apprehension he forthwith determined to effect. This resolution was, of course, grounded on the belief that however great the knowledge of Elisha might be, if seized and kept a prisoner, he could no longer give information to the king of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Sent to the place, </span> either spies, to try whether the prophet spake truth; or rather, soldiers, to secure the place and passage designed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saved himself; </span> either his person when he was to pass that way; or his people, or places of importance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not once nor twice, </span> but much more frequently. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him, and warned him of,....

As the common dwelling-place had become too small for them, they resolved, with Elisha's consent, to build a new house, and went, accompanied by the prophet, to the woody bank of the Jordan to fell the wood that was required for the building. The place where the common abode had become too small is not given, but most of the commentators suppose it to have been Gilgal, chiefly from the erroneous assumption that the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a> was in the Jordan valley to the east of Jericho. Thenius only cites in support of this the reference in &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (dwell with thee) to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>; but this decides nothing, as the pupils of the prophets sat before Elisha, or gathered together around their master in a common home, not merely in Gilgal, but also in Bethel and Jericho. We might rather think of Jericho, since Bethel and Gilgal (Jiljilia) were so far distant from the Jordan, that there is very little probability that a removal of the meeting-place to the Jordan, such as is indicated by &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, would ever have been thought of from either of these localities. </body></html>
