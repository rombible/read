Trouble comes sometimes from that point whence we least feared it. The mention of this invasion on the death of Elisha, shows that the removal of God's faithful prophets is a presage of coming judgments. His dead body was a means of giving life to another dead body. This miracle was a confirmation of his prophecies. And it may have reference to Christ, by whose death and burial, the grave is made a safe and happy passage to life to all believers. Jehoash was successful against the Syrians, just as often as he had struck the ground with the arrows, then a stop was put to his victories. Many have repented, when too late, of distrusts and the straitness of their desires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The writer regards the captivity of Israel as God's "casting them out of His sight" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20</a>); and notes that this extreme punishment, though deserved, was by God's mercy not allowed to fall on them as yet. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. Elisha died&#8212;He had enjoyed a happier life than Elijah, as he possessed a milder character, and bore a less hard commission. His rough garment was honored even at the court.<p>coming in of the year&#8212;that is, the spring, the usual season of beginning campaigns in ancient times. Predatory bands from Moab generally made incursions at that time on the lands of Israel. The bearers of a corpse, alarmed by the appearance of one of these bands, hastily deposited, as they passed that way, their load in Elisha's sepulchre, which might be easily done by removing the stone at the mouth of the cave. According to the Jewish and Eastern custom, his body, as well as that of the man who was miraculously restored, was not laid in a coffin, but only swathed; so that the bodies could be brought into contact, and the object of the miracle was to stimulate the king's and people of Israel's faith in the still unaccomplished predictions of Elisha respecting the war with the Syrians. Accordingly the historian forthwith records the historical fulfilment of the prediction (2Ki 13:22-25), in the defeat of the enemy, in the recovery of the cities that had been taken, and their restoration to the kingdom of Israel.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From his presence, </span> i.e. from the land of Canaan, to which the presence and public and solemn worship of God was confined. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord was gracious to them,....

While he was still punishing Israel by the sword of Hazael, he was yet careful not to make a full end, not to allow the affliction to proceed too far. He still preserved the nation, and kept it in being. <span class="cmt_word">And had respect unto them</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "considered them - kept them in his mind - did not permit them to slip out of his recollection" - <span class="cmt_word">because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span> God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was a covenant of mercy. By it he had pledged himself to multiply their seed, to be their God, and the God of their seed after them, and to give to their seed the whole land of Canaan for an <span class="accented">everlasting</span> possession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-8</a>, etc.). This covenant bound him to extend his protection over the people of Israel so long as they had not utterly and entirely cast off their allegiance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And would not destroy them.</span> They were "persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-9.htm">2 Corinthians 4:9</a>).

He then placed his hands upon the king's hands, as a sign that the power which was to be given to the bow-shot came from the Lord through the mediation of the prophet. He then directed him to open the window towards the east and shoot, adding as he shot off the arrow: "An arrow of salvation from the Lord, and an arrow of salvation against the Syrians; and thou wilt smite the Syrians at Aphek (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26</a>) to destruction." The arrow that was shot off was to be a symbol of the help of the Lord against the Syrians to their destruction. This promise the king was then to appropriate to himself through an act of his own. Elisha therefore directed him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-18.htm">2 Kings 13:18</a>) to "take the arrows;" and when he had taken them, said: &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; &#1492;&#1498;, "strike to the earth," i.e., shoot the arrows to the ground, not "smite the earth with the bundle of arrows" (Thenius), which neither agrees with the shooting of the first arrow, nor admits of a grammatical vindication; for &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, when used of an arrow, signifies to shoot and to strike with the arrow shot off, i.e., to wound or to kill (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>). The shooting of the arrows to the earth was intended to symbolize the overthrow of the Syrians. "And the king shot three times, and then stood (still)," i.e., left off shooting.</body></html>
