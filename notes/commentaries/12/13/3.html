There could not be a greater reproach than the two idolized calves were, to a people acquainted with the nature and attributes of God, and intrusted with his lively oracles, in which he had given them rules, of his own appointment, to direct them how to worship him. Strange it is, indeed, that in all the history of the ten tribes, we never find the least shock given to that idolatry, but, in every reign, still the calf was their god! and that notwithstanding the many and repeated judgments executed upon them to reclaim them from that senseless and stupid practice. Well might the anger of God be kindled against them! <span class="ital">And he delivered them into the hand of Hazael — </span>It had been the honour of Israel that they were taken under the special protection of Heaven: God himself was their defence, <span class="ital">the shield of their help, </span>and <span class="ital">the sword of their excellency. </span>But here again, as often before, we find them stripped of this glory, and exposed to the insults of all their neighbours. Surely never was any nation so often plucked and pillaged as Israel was: but this they brought upon themselves by their sins: and when they had provoked God to break down their hedge, the goodness of their land did but tempt their neighbours. So low was Israel brought in this reign, by the many depredations which the Syrians made upon them, that the militia of the kingdom, and all the force they could bring into the field, was but <span class="ital">fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, </span>a despicable muster, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-7.htm" title="Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.">2 Kings 13:7</a>.

Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All their days - literally, "all the days."

Jehoahaz's Wicked Reign over Israel.<p>1-3. Jehoahaz &#8230; reigned seventeen years&#8212;Under his government, which pursued the policy of his predecessors regarding the support of the calf-worship, Israel's apostasy from the true God became greater and more confirmed than in the time of his father Jehu. The national chastisement, when it came, was consequently the more severe and the instruments employed by the Lord in scourging the revolted nation were Hazael and his son and general Ben-hadad, in resisting whose successive invasions the Israelitish army was sadly reduced and weakened. In the extremity of his distress, Jehoahaz besought the Lord, and was heard, not on his own account (Ps 66:18; Pr 1:28; 15:8), but that of the ancient covenant with the patriarchs (2Ki 13:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or rather, <span class="ital">all his days</span>, as it is explained, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-22.htm" title="But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.">2 Kings 13:22</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel,....

The sense cannot be what is represented by A.V. For in the days of Benhadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-25.htm" title="And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.">2 Kings 13:25</a>) the son of Jehoahaz made conquests from Benhadad. Hence ‘all the days’ must mean the days of Jehoahaz, which accords with the statement of verse 22 below. So ‘continually’ must refer to the whole of this reign.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.</span> We know so much less of the nature of the calf-worship and of the rites which accompanied it, that we cannot to the same extent justify the Divine severity in connection with it as in connection with the Baal and Astarte cult. Still, we must remember the coarse, lewd dancing which accompanied the first calf-worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>), for which death was not thought too heavy a penalty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-27.htm">Exodus 32:27</a>), and the almost universal combination of unchastity with idolatrous ceremonies, which raises a suspicion that those who frequented the shrines at Dan and Bethel were not wholly innocent of impurity. <span class="cmt_word">And he delivered them into the hand of Hazel King of Syria.</span> The national sins of Israel were mostly punished in this way, by the sword of some foreign foe. Hazael had been already made an instrument for the chastisement of Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>). Now he was to chastise Jehoahaz still more severely. <span class="cmt_word">And into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all the days</span>. Not certainly all the days of the two kings Hazael and Benhadad, for Benhadad was entirely worsted in his war with Joash (vers. 24, 25), but either all the days of Jehoahaz, or all the days that God had appointed for the duration of the calamity. It is perhaps against the former interpretation that Hazael appears to have outlived Jehoahaz (vers. 22-24); but Ben-hadad may have warred against him as his father's general (ver. 25) during his father's lifetime. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brief account of Hazael's campaign against Jerusalem is completed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23-24</a>. Hazael had gone down along the coast after defeating Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>), for the purpose of making war upon Judah also, and had taken Gath, which Rehoboam had fortified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). He then set his face, i.e., determined, to advance to Jerusalem; and Joash took the temple treasures, etc. According to the Chronicles, he sent an army against Judah and Jerusalem, which destroyed all the princes of the nation and sent much booty to the king to Damascus, as the small army of the Syrians had smitten the very large army of Judah. To protect Jerusalem, after this defeat, from being taken by the Syrians, Joash sent all the treasures of the temple and palace to Hazael, and so purchased the withdrawal of the Syrians. In this way the two brief accounts of the war may be both reconciled and explained; whereas the opinion, still repeated by Thenius, that the two passages treat of different wars, has no tenable ground to rest upon. The Philistian city of Gath (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>) appears to have belonged at that time to the kingdom of Judah, so that the Gathites were not among the Philistines who made an incursion into Judah in the reign of Joram along with the Arabian tribes of the south (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>). And it is impossible to determine when Gath was wrested from the Syrians again; probably in the time of Joash the son of Jehoahaz of Israel, as he recovered from the Syrians all the cities which they had taken from the Israelites under Jehoahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-25.htm">2 Kings 13:25</a>), and even smote Amaziah the king of Judaea at Bethshemesh and took him prisoner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a>.). "All the consecrated things, which Jehoshaphat, Joram, and Ahaziah had consecrated, and his own consecrated things," i.e., what he (Joash) himself had consecrated. The existence of such temple treasures is not at variance either with the previous account of the repairing of the temple, for Joash would not use the consecrated offerings for the restoration of the temple, as the current revenue of the temple was sufficient for the purpose, or with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>, where it is stated that Athaliah and her sons had applied all the &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; to the Baals (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>); for even if we are to understand by the sons of Athaliah not bastard sons (Ewald, Gesch. iii. p. 582), but the brethren of Joram whom the Philistines and Arabians had carried off, Ahaziah and Joram, although they both of them served Baal, may, from political considerations, have now and then made consecrated gifts to the temple, if only in a passing fit of religious fear. </body></html>
