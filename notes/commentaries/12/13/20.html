Trouble comes sometimes from that point whence we least feared it. The mention of this invasion on the death of Elisha, shows that the removal of God's faithful prophets is a presage of coming judgments. His dead body was a means of giving life to another dead body. This miracle was a confirmation of his prophecies. And it may have reference to Christ, by whose death and burial, the grave is made a safe and happy passage to life to all believers. Jehoash was successful against the Syrians, just as often as he had struck the ground with the arrows, then a stop was put to his victories.

The defeat which they suffered at the hands of Jehoram and Jehoshaphat <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-24.htm">2 Kings 3:24</a> did not affect their subjugation. They spread themselves into the country north of the Arnon <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>, and thence proceeded to make plundering expeditious year by year into Samaria, in Spring. This was the natural season for incursions, as then in Palestine the crops began to be ripe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. Elisha died&#8212;He had enjoyed a happier life than Elijah, as he possessed a milder character, and bore a less hard commission. His rough garment was honored even at the court.<p>coming in of the year&#8212;that is, the spring, the usual season of beginning campaigns in ancient times. Predatory bands from Moab generally made incursions at that time on the lands of Israel. The bearers of a corpse, alarmed by the appearance of one of these bands, hastily deposited, as they passed that way, their load in Elisha's sepulchre, which might be easily done by removing the stone at the mouth of the cave. According to the Jewish and Eastern custom, his body, as well as that of the man who was miraculously restored, was not laid in a coffin, but only swathed; so that the bodies could be brought into contact, and the object of the miracle was to stimulate the king's and people of Israel's faith in the still unaccomplished predictions of Elisha respecting the war with the Syrians. Accordingly the historian forthwith records the historical fulfilment of the prediction (2Ki 13:22-25), in the defeat of the enemy, in the recovery of the cities that had been taken, and their restoration to the kingdom of Israel.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They buried him, </span> in or near Samaria. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At the coming in of the year; </span> in the spring, when the fruits of the earth grew ripe. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Elisha died, and they buried him,.... In Samaria. Epiphanius says (n), in Sebastopolis of Samaria, Samaria itself was called Sebaste in later times; though the Jews say (o) he was buried in Mount Carmel, in the cave of Elijah; according to the Jewish chronology (p), he died in the tenth year of Joash, and he prophesied more than sixty years; sixty six, as Abarbinel, since he began to prophesy in the nineteenth year of Jehoshaphat; and, according to Clemens (q) of Alexandria, when he was forty years of age; but it seems rather, as Kimchi observes, that he died in the beginning of the reign of Joash, and even before his father's death, when he was a partner with him in the throne, and before any salvation or deliverance from the Syrians was wrought: <p>and the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year; at the spring of the year, when there was fruit on the earth, those troops of robbers came to plunder and spoil; several of the Jewish writers observe, that in the word for "coming", is instead of  and so may be rendered "in that year", in that selfsame year that Elisha died; and so read the Syriac, Arabic, and the Vulgate Latin versions. <p>(n) De Vitis Prophet. c. 6.

Probably the great devastations of the Syrians on the east of Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/10-32.htm" title="In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;...">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>) made it easier for the Moabites to cross the Jordan and to ravage the lands of Israel to the west of the river.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>at <span class="ital">the coming in of the year</span>] We can see from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.">2 Samuel 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-22.htm" title="And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.">1 Kings 20:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-26.htm" title="And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.">1 Kings 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.">1 Chronicles 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm" title="And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>, that there was a season of the year at which alone it was usual, and perhaps, on account of the climate, possible, for an army to take the field. The general expression is ‘when the year was expired’: but this is very much the same as ‘at the coming in of another year’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha died, and they buried him.</span> There had been no burial of Elijah, who" went up by a whirlwind into heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>). All the more anxious, therefore, would the Israelites be to bury their second great prophet with due honor. They prepared him, no doubt, one of those excavated sepulchers which were usual at the time and in the country - a squared or vaulted chamber cut in the native rock. St. Jerome says that the place of his sepulture was near Samaria ('Epitaph. Paulae'), and this is sufficiently probable; but in the Middle Ages his grave was shown at Ruma, in Galilee (Ewald, 'Hist. of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 122, note 3). According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 6), his funeral was magnificent. <span class="cmt_word">And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</span> It seems to be implied that this was a usual occurrence. Just as the Syrians in the days of Naaman made marauding raids into the land from time to time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2</a>), so now the Moabites each spring made an incursion. The weakness of Israel is strongly marked by this fact, and still more by the penetration of the Moabites so deep into their country. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a> perhaps glances at these incursions of Moab. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Illness and Death of the Prophet Elisha. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>. When Elisha was taken ill with the sickness of which he was to die, king Joash visited him and wept over his face, i.e., bending over the sick man as he lay, and exclaimed, "My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and horsemen thereof!" just as Elisha had mourned over the departure of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>). This lamentation of the king at the approaching death of the prophet shows that Joash knew how to value his labours. And on account of this faith which was manifested in his recognition of the prophet's worth, the Lord gave the king another gracious assurance through the dying Elisha, which was confirmed by means of a symbolical action.</body></html>
