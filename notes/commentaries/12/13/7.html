Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared.

Hence it is a most significant figure, frequently employed by Orientals to describe a state of national suffering, little short of extermination (Isa 21:10; Mic 4:12; Jer 51:33). The figure originated in a barbarous war custom, which Hazael literally followed (Am 1:3, 4; compare 2Sa 18:31; Jud 8:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Neither did he, </span> i.e. the king of Syria, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm" title="And Jehoahaz sought the LORD, and the LORD listened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.">2 Kings 13:4</a></span>, with which this verse is to be joined; <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm" title="(And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelled in their tents, as beforetime.">2 Kings 13:5</a>,6</span> being put within a parenthesis, as it is in our translation.

Not only does R.V. render the original here more exactly, but it indicates clearly where the parenthesis of the last two verses comes to an end. We have here the continuation of verse 4, and a picture of the character and extent of the Syrian oppression. When we call to mind that in David’s times (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm" title="And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.">2 Samuel 24:9</a>) the warriors of Israel were eight hundred thousand men, we can form some idea of the way in which Israel was now ‘cut short’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them</span>] The R.V. omits ‘<span class="bld">had</span>’ in both places. This is right, for the description refers to the time of Jehoahaz. Whether the destruction here mentioned was by making them slaves or by extermination, we cannot tell, but it is much the most probable that a warlike people like the Syrians would take soldiers prisoners and use them in their wars with Assyria and elsewhere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">like the dust by threshing</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">in threshing</span>. The correct sense is given on the margin of R.V. ‘dust to trample on’. The Oriental manner of threshing is by the trampling of oxen’s feet, and the figure is used to signify the utter prostration of Israel. The LXX. also has the right idea, giving <span class="greekheb">εἰς καταπάτησιν</span>. For the word used thus of trampling under foot cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-10.htm" title="For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.">Isaiah 25:10</a> ‘Moab shall be <span class="ital">trodden down</span> under him even as straw is <span class="ital">trodden down</span>’, where the margin gives twice over ‘threshed’. The reference in the margin of A.V. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a> where the cruelties of Damascus are described, ‘they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron’, probably does not apply to the account before us. All that is here meant is that Israel was utterly reduced and broken. The ‘dust in threshing’ of R.V. is an attempt to be literal and yet to avoid the implication of barbarity which is conveyed in A.V.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen.</span> This verse seems to be an exegetical note on ver. 4, which perhaps it once followed immediately, the parenthetic section (vers. 5 and 6) having been added later, as an afterthought, either by the original writer, or perhaps by a later hand. The meaning seems to be that Hazael limited the standing army of Jehoahaz to fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, not that he slew the entire military population except this small remnant. The policy of limiting the forces to be maintained by a subject-king was one known to the Romans, and has often been adopted in the East. It is still a part of our own policy in the government of India. The limitation left the country at the mercy of all its neighbors (see ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">For the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</span> Possibly this means no more than an utter destruction - a trampling in the dust, as we phrase it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12, 13</a>; and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>). But it may be an allusion to that destruction of prisoners by means of a threshing instrument, which was certainly sometimes practiced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a>), and which is made a special charge against Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. See Pusey's 'Minor Prophets,' p. 158). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jehoahaz. - Jehu was followed by Jehoahaz his son, "in the twenty-third year of Joash of Judah." This synchronistic statement is not only at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10</a>, but cannot be very well reconciled with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>. If Jehoahaz began to reign in the twenty-third year of Joash king of Judah, and reigned seventeen years, his son cannot have followed him after his death in the thirty-seventh year of Joash of Judah, as is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10</a>, for there are only fourteen years and possibly a few months between the twenty-third and thirty-seventh years of Joash; and even if he ascended the throne at the commencement of the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash and died at the end of the thirty-seventh, they could only be reckoned as fifteen and not as seventeen years. Moreover, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>, Joash of Judah began to reign in the seventh year of Jehu, and therefore Athaliah, who ascended the throne at the same time as Jehu, reigned fully six years. If, therefore, the first year of Joash of Judah coincides with the seventh year of Jehu, the twenty-eighth year of Jehu must correspond to the twenty-second year of Joash of Judah; and in this year of Joash not only did Jehu die, but his son Jehoahaz ascended the throne. Consequently we must substitute the twenty-second year of Joash, or perhaps, still more correctly, the twenty-first year (Josephus), for the twenty-third.<p>(Note: On the other hand, Thenius, who follows des Vignoles and Winer, not only defends the correctness of the account "in the twenty-third year of Joash," because it agrees with the twenty-eight years' reign of Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-36.htm">2 Kings 10:36</a>), but also holds fast the seventeen years' duration of the reign of Jehoahaz on account of its agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-1.htm">2 Kings 14:1</a>; for 6 years (Athaliah) + 40 years (Joash)  equals  46 years, and 28 years (Jehu) + 17 years (Jehoahaz)  equals  45 years; so that, as is there affirmed, Amaziah the son of Joash ascended the throne in the second year of Joash the son of Jehoahaz. But to arrive at this result he assumes that there is an error in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10</a>, namely, that instead of the thirty-seventh year we ought to read the thirty-ninth year there, according to the edit. Aldina of the lxx. But apart from the fact that, as we have shown above in the text, the datum "in the twenty-third year of Joash" does not harmonize with the twenty-eight years' reign of Jehu, this solution of the difference is overthrown by the circumstance that, in order to obtain this agreement between <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-1.htm">2 Kings 13:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>, Thenius reckons the years of the reigns not only of Athaliah and Joash, but also of Jehu and Jehoahaz, as full years (the former 16 + 40, the latter 28 + 17); whereas, in order to bring the datum in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-1.htm">2 Kings 13:1</a> (in the twenty-third year of Joash) into harmony with the emendation proposed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10</a> (in the thirty-ninth year of Joash), he reckons the length of the reign of Jehoahaz as only sixteen years (instead of seventeen). For example, if Jehoahaz reigned seventeen years, supposing that he ascended the throne in the twenty-third year of Joash of Judah, he died in the fortieth year of Joash (not the thirty-ninth), and his son began to reign the same year. In that case Amaziah would have begun to reign in the first year of Jehoash of Israel, and not in the second, as is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-1.htm">2 Kings 14:1</a>. - The reading of the lxx (ed. Ald. v. 10), "in the thirty-ninth year," is therefore nothing but a mistaken emendation resorted to for the purpose of removing a discrepancy, but of no critical value.)<p>If Jehu died in the earliest months of the twenty-eighth year of his reign, so that he only reigned twenty-seven years and one or two months, his death and his son's ascent of the throne might fall even in the closing months of the twenty-first year of the reign of Joash of Judah. And from the twenty-first to the thirty-seventh year of Joash, Jehoahaz may have reigned sixteen years and a few months, and his reign be described as lasting seventeen years.</body></html>
