Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In this chapter the history of the kingdom of Israel is traced through the two reigns of Jehoahaz and Jehoash.

Jehoahaz's Wicked Reign over Israel.<p>1-3. Jehoahaz &#8230; reigned seventeen years&#8212;Under his government, which pursued the policy of his predecessors regarding the support of the calf-worship, Israel's apostasy from the true God became greater and more confirmed than in the time of his father Jehu. The national chastisement, when it came, was consequently the more severe and the instruments employed by the Lord in scourging the revolted nation were Hazael and his son and general Ben-hadad, in resisting whose successive invasions the Israelitish army was sadly reduced and weakened. In the extremity of his distress, Jehoahaz besought the Lord, and was heard, not on his own account (Ps 66:18; Pr 1:28; 15:8), but that of the ancient covenant with the patriarchs (2Ki 13:23).Jehoahaz king of Israel followeth the sin of Jeroboam; is oppressed by Hazael; and relieved by prayer, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/13-1.htm" title="In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years....">2 Kings 13:1-9</a></span>.

Jehoahaz’s seventeen years, according to the statement before us, would go on to the <span class="ital">fortieth</span> year of Joash king of Judah, whereas the successor of Jehoahaz is stated in verse 10 to have begun his reign in the <span class="ital">thirty-seventh</span> year of Joash. It is possible that seventeen years, according to Jewish reckoning, may really have been very little more than fifteen. Still that does not bring the dates into accord. Where the mistake may be is not easy to discover. The LXX. represents the same numbers, which it is clear cannot all be correct, though the error is not large.

This is a correction required by ver. 10 and also by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>. The proof is given at somewhat tedious length by Keil ('Biblical Commentary,' pp. 373, 374) and Bahr ('Books of the Kings,' pp. 139, 140). It seems unnecessary to enter into a lengthy discussion of the point, since all the synchronisms of the later kings of Israel and Judah are in confusion, and appear to be the work of a later hand. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Ahaziah</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>) <span class="cmt_word">King of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">reigned over Israel</span>. The "later hand," which inserted the synchronism, neglected to bring the two portions of the verse into agreement. Our translators have sought to cover up his omission by translating <span class="accented">malak</span> "began to <span class="accented">reign</span>," and then supplying "and reigned" in the next clause. And reigned <span class="cmt_word">seventeen years</span> (so also Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The money obtained from trespass-offerings and sin-offerings was not brought into the house of Jehovah, i.e., was not applied to the repairing of the temple, but was left for the priests. In the case of the trespass-offering compensation had to be made for the earthly debt according to the valuation of the priest, with the addition of a fifth in money; and this was assigned to the priests not only in the case of a &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; committed against Jehovah, but also when a neighbour had been injured in his property, if he had died in the meantime (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a>). On the other hand, in the case of the sin-offerings the priests received no money according to the law. Most of the commentators therefore assume, that those who lived at a distance had sent money to the priests, that they might offer sin-offerings with it, and what money as over they had retained for themselves. But there is not the slightest trace of any such custom, which is quite at variance with the idea of the sin-offering. It may probably have become a customary thing in the course of time, for those who presented these offerings to compensate the officiating priest for his trouble by a free-will gift. </body></html>
