It may turn much to our spiritual advantage, to attend the sick-beds and death-beds of good men, that we may be encouraged in religion by the living comforts they have from it in a dying hour. Elisha assured the king of his success; yet he must look up to God for direction and strength; must reckon his own hands not enough, but go on, in dependence upon Divine aid. The trembling hands of the dying prophet, as they signified the power of God, gave this arrow more force than the hands of the king in his full strength. By contemning the sign, the king lost the thing signified, to the grief of the dying prophet. It is a trouble to good men, to see those to whom they wish well, forsake their own mercies, and to see them lose advantages against spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to ordinary laws of historical composition, these verses should form the closing paragraph of the present chapter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah&#8212;(See on [340]2Ki 14:8-14).

After his victory the king of Israel broke down a part of the wall of Jerusalem, and carried away the treasures and vessels both from the house of the Lord and from the king’s house.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah King of Judah</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11-14</a>), <span class="cmt_word">are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> Either this and the next verses have been displaced from their rightful position by some accident, or the author at one time intended to terminate his account of Joash at this point.
