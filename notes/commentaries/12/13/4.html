Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared.

The Syrians are allowed to oppress Israel all the days of Jehoahaz, though we are told that his prayer had been heard. In the days of Jehoash, the next successor, some alleviation was afforded by the victories of that king over Benhadad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-25.htm" title="And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war.

Jehoahaz, as Josephus says, "betook him-serf to prayer and supplication of God, entreating that he would deliver him out of the hands of Hazael, and not suffer him to continue subject" ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 5). He did not turn from his sin of idolatry, perhaps did not suspect that it was this sin which had provoked God's anger; but in a general way he repented, humbled himself, and besought God's mercy and assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord hearkened unto him.</span> God accepted his repentance, all imperfect as it was, so far as to save the people from the entire destruction with which it was threatened by the severe measures of Hazael (ver. 7), to continue the national existence (ver. 23), and ultimately to restore the national prosperity (ver. 25 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-27</a>). But he did not remove the oppression, as Josephus imagines, in Jehoahaz's time. Ver. 22 makes this fact absolutely certain. <span class="cmt_word">For he saw the oppression of Israel, because the King of Syria oppressed them.</span> Oppression is always hateful to God, even when he is using it as his instrument for chastising or punishing a guilty people. He "sees" it, notes it, lays it up in his remembrance for future retribution (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>, etc.).

This description of the locality is perfectly obscure for us. The conjecture that &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; was the house in the castle of Millo which is so frequently mentioned (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>), is precluded by the fact that this castle is always called &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (with the article). &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; is regarded by many as an abbreviation of &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, "which goes down by the road;" and Thenius supposes that the reference is to the road which ran diagonally through the city from the Joppa gate to the Haram-area, corresponding to the present David's road. Others regard &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; as the proper name of a place in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. It is impossible to get any certain meaning out of it, unless we alter the text according to arbitrary assumptions, as Thenius has done. The conspirators were Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-21.htm">2 Kings 12:21</a>; but according to the Chronicles (v. 26), they were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. The identity of the first names is perfectly obvious. &#1494;&#1489;&#1491; is a copyist's error for &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, and this is the contracted form of &#1497;&#1493;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;. The difference in the second: son of Shomer according to our text, and son of the Shimrith according to the Chronicles, has probably also arisen from a slip of the pen, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; might easily be occasioned by the dropping out of the &#1514; from the defectively written &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, although it is also possible that Shomer may be the name of the grandfather. Joash was buried with his father sin the city of David; but according to v. 25 of the Chronicles he was not buried in the graves of the kings. The two statements are not irreconcilable; and there may be good historical ground for the account in the Chronicles, as Bertheau acknowledges with perfect justice, in spite of the suspicion which has been cast upon it by Thenius. </body></html>
