Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is that "he, the king of Syria" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a> Hazael) limited the standing army of Jehoahaz.<p>Like the dust by threshing - An expression not only employed metaphorically, and importing defeat, conquest, and grinding oppression <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>, but implying also the literal use of threshing-instruments in the execution of prisoners of war (marginal reference, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 13:8-25.
