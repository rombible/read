This is written, of course, from the point of view of the Judæan editor of Kings, who lived long after the events of which he is writing in the period of the exile. It does not appear from the history of Elijah and Elisha, incorporated in his work, that either of those great prophets ever protested against the worship established at Bethel and Dan.<p><span class= "bld">The house of Jeroboam</span>—Some MSS., the Syriac, Targum, and Arabic omit “house.” But the specification of the <span class= "ital">dynasty</span> is here very appropriate.<p><span class= "bld">But walked therein.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">therein they walked;</span> the reading of the LXX.

It symbolised the productive principle of nature, and was sacred to Ashtoreth. With the return of peace, and the renewal of prosperity, luxury also soon reappeared, and the idolatry that specially countenanced it lifted up its head again. (See the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm" title="And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.">2Kings 17:16</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 It was the ancient honour of Israel that they were a praying people. Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But walked therein - Rather, "he walked therein," meaning Joash, the "saviour" of the preceding verse.<p>There remained the grove also in Samaria - It seems strange that Jehu had not destroyed this when he put down the worship of Baal <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26-28</a>.

Thenius would cancel it. <span class="cmt_word">But walked therein</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he walked</span>. But here again a corruption may be suspected. Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span> we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, which lost its final letter in consequence of the <span class="accented">vau</span> that immediately followed it. <span class="cmt_word">And there remained the grove also in Samaria.</span> "The grove in Samaria" was that idolatrous emblem which Ahab had set up at Jezebel's suggestion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-33.htm">1 Kings 16:33</a>), the nature of which has been much disputed. Some think that it was "an image of Astarte" (see 'Homiletic Commentary' on 1 Kings, p. 374); but more probably it was a mere emblem, analogous to the Assyrian "sacred tree." Its material may sometimes have been wood, but was perhaps more usually metal. The mistranslation "grove" originated with the Septuagint translators, who uniformly rendered <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It is surprising that Jehu did not destroy the <span class="accented">asherah</span> together with the other idolatrous erections of Ahab in Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26-28</a>); but, for some reason or other, it seems to have been spared, and to have been still standing. So long as it stood, even if it did not attract the religious regards of any, it would be a standing dishonor to God, and would so increase the sin of the nation. Hence its mention in this passage. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Conspiracy against Joash. - Not long after the departure of the Syrians, who had left Joash, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>, with many wounds, his servants formed a conspiracy against him and slew him upon his bed in the house Millo, which goeth down to Silla. This description of the locality is perfectly obscure for us. The conjecture that &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; was the house in the castle of Millo which is so frequently mentioned (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>), is precluded by the fact that this castle is always called &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (with the article). &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; is regarded by many as an abbreviation of &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, "which goes down by the road;" and Thenius supposes that the reference is to the road which ran diagonally through the city from the Joppa gate to the Haram-area, corresponding to the present David's road. Others regard &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; as the proper name of a place in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. It is impossible to get any certain meaning out of it, unless we alter the text according to arbitrary assumptions, as Thenius has done. The conspirators were Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-21.htm">2 Kings 12:21</a>; but according to the Chronicles (v. 26), they were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. The identity of the first names is perfectly obvious. &#1494;&#1489;&#1491; is a copyist's error for &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, and this is the contracted form of &#1497;&#1493;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;. The difference in the second: son of Shomer according to our text, and son of the Shimrith according to the Chronicles, has probably also arisen from a slip of the pen, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; might easily be occasioned by the dropping out of the &#1514; from the defectively written &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, although it is also possible that Shomer may be the name of the grandfather. Joash was buried with his father sin the city of David; but according to v. 25 of the Chronicles he was not buried in the graves of the kings. The two statements are not irreconcilable; and there may be good historical ground for the account in the Chronicles, as Bertheau acknowledges with perfect justice, in spite of the suspicion which has been cast upon it by Thenius. </body></html>
