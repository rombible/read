Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord gave Israel a saviour - Not immediately on the repentance of Jehoahaz but after his death (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-25.htm">2 Kings 13:25</a>).<p>They went out from under the hand of the Syrians - i. e. they ceased to be oppressed by the Syrians; they shook off their yoke, and became once more perfectly independent.<p>Tents - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. a saviour&#8212;This refers neither to some patriotic defender nor some signal victory, but to the deliverance obtained for Israel by the two successors of Jehoahaz, namely, Joash, who regained all the cities which the Syrians had taken from his father (2Ki 13:25); and Jeroboam, who restored the former boundaries of Israel (2Ki 14:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A saviour; either Elisha, below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm" title="Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.

The two verses 5 and 6 are a parenthesis, and interrupt the connexion. The ‘<span class="ital">saviour</span>’ alludes to what is said of Jeroboam 2. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-27.htm" title="And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.">2 Kings 14:27</a>). ‘The Lord <span class="ital">saved</span> Israel by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash’. This was the time when the prayer of Jehoahaz was truly answered, in the reign of his grandson. That passage is connected with this also by the language of the preceding verse (26) ‘The Lord <span class="ital">saw the affliction of Israel</span>, that it was bitter’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians</span>] Language like this must refer to some very great change in the relative positions of Syria and Israel. We have some indication of it in the statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2 Kings 14:28</a>) that Jeroboam recovered Damascus for Israel. By such a reverse the power of Syria must have been severely broken. We learn from the cuneiform inscriptions (1 Rawl. 35) that Damascus was about this time made subject to Assyria (Schrader p. 110; Eng. Trans. vol. 1. 203). It may be therefore that by the help of Assyria (which we have seen that Israel sometimes gained at the expense of liberty) the kings of Israel were able to shake off the thraldom of their nearer, and therefore more galling, oppressor, at first partially, then completely, so as to come from under his hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the children of Israel dwelt in their tents</span>] The expression may refer to the peaceful state when the dwellers in the country could live safely out amid their flocks and crops, and not be constrained by the pressure of war to seek refuge in the towns. But it has been noted (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm" title="On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.">1 Kings 8:66</a>) that ‘tents’ is used for ‘homes’. Hence the words of this verse may mean only that the people lived quietly at home, and were not constantly called forth to resist the inroads of the Syrians.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians.</span> A "savior'" means a deliverer from the hand of the Syrians (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a>, where in the Hebrew the word used is the same). The special "deliverer" was probably in the mind of the writer, Jeroboam II., by whom he says, in ch. 14:27, that God "saved" Israel; but Joash, who began the deliverance (ver. 25), may also be glanced at, <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel dwelt in their tents.</span> Here, as so often elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-12.htm">2 Kings 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-7.htm">Zechariah 12:7</a>), the word "tents" is a mere archaism for "abodes, houses." Israel had dwelt in tents until the going down into Egypt, and again from the time of quitting Egypt to the entrance into Canaan; and thus the word <span class="accented">ohel had ac</span>quired a secondary meaning of "abode," "dwelling-place." In the time which followed on the deliverance from the Syrian yoke, the Israelites of the ten tribes were no longer engaged in marches and countermarches, in battles, skirmishes, or sieges, but quietly abode in their several houses. <span class="cmt_word">As beforetime</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. as in</span> the peaceful time before the attacks of Hazael began. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Conspiracy against Joash. - Not long after the departure of the Syrians, who had left Joash, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>, with many wounds, his servants formed a conspiracy against him and slew him upon his bed in the house Millo, which goeth down to Silla. This description of the locality is perfectly obscure for us. The conjecture that &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; was the house in the castle of Millo which is so frequently mentioned (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>), is precluded by the fact that this castle is always called &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (with the article). &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; is regarded by many as an abbreviation of &#1502;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, "which goes down by the road;" and Thenius supposes that the reference is to the road which ran diagonally through the city from the Joppa gate to the Haram-area, corresponding to the present David's road. Others regard &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; as the proper name of a place in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. It is impossible to get any certain meaning out of it, unless we alter the text according to arbitrary assumptions, as Thenius has done. The conspirators were Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-21.htm">2 Kings 12:21</a>; but according to the Chronicles (v. 26), they were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. The identity of the first names is perfectly obvious. &#1494;&#1489;&#1491; is a copyist's error for &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, and this is the contracted form of &#1497;&#1493;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;. The difference in the second: son of Shomer according to our text, and son of the Shimrith according to the Chronicles, has probably also arisen from a slip of the pen, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; might easily be occasioned by the dropping out of the &#1514; from the defectively written &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, although it is also possible that Shomer may be the name of the grandfather. Joash was buried with his father sin the city of David; but according to v. 25 of the Chronicles he was not buried in the graves of the kings. The two statements are not irreconcilable; and there may be good historical ground for the account in the Chronicles, as Bertheau acknowledges with perfect justice, in spite of the suspicion which has been cast upon it by Thenius. </body></html>
