Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; applied himself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him? He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready to hear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he would not look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so often broken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him; and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent; for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if the Lord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much more will he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In this chapter the history of the kingdom of Israel is traced through the two reigns of Jehoahaz and Jehoash.

Jehoahaz's Wicked Reign over Israel.<p>1-3. Jehoahaz &#8230; reigned seventeen years&#8212;Under his government, which pursued the policy of his predecessors regarding the support of the calf-worship, Israel's apostasy from the true God became greater and more confirmed than in the time of his father Jehu. The national chastisement, when it came, was consequently the more severe and the instruments employed by the Lord in scourging the revolted nation were Hazael and his son and general Ben-hadad, in resisting whose successive invasions the Israelitish army was sadly reduced and weakened. In the extremity of his distress, Jehoahaz besought the Lord, and was heard, not on his own account (Ps 66:18; Pr 1:28; 15:8), but that of the ancient covenant with the patriarchs (2Ki 13:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,....

As usual. The same change is needed below in verses 6 and 11 of this chapter. We must understand the language of this verse as referring not only to the days of Jehoahaz, but to those of his father Jehu, at least so far as the delivery of Israel into the hand of Hazael is concerned. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm" title="In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;">2 Kings 10:32</a> we have already been told that in the time of Jehu ‘the Lord began to cut Israel short, and Hazael smote them’. What the writer here wishes to represent is that in spite of the calamities which befel the nation from Hazael in the previous reign, the son was no better than his father, and so ‘the Lord’s anger was kindled’; He sent severer punishments on those whom His warnings had not moved, and Hazael not only inflicted blows on the power of Israel, but made them still more subject to him.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> There is no reason to believe that Jehoahaz re-introduced the Baal-worship, or sinned in any other flagrant way than by maintaining the calf-worship at Dan and Bethel. Jehu had done the same (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>), as had all previous kings of Israel from the time of Jeroboam. The honor of God, however, required that idolatry of whatever kind should be punished, and the Samaritan kingdom could not otherwise be saved from destruction than by, "casting away <span class="accented">all</span> the works of darkness" and returning to the <span class="accented">pure</span> worship of Jehovah. Hence Jehu himself, notwithstanding the good service that he had done in crushing the Baal-worship, was chastised by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>) on account of his continuance in the "sin of Jeroboam;" and now Jehoahaz was even more signally punished. As Keil remarks, "The longer and the more obstinately the sin was continued, the more severe did the punishment become." <span class="cmt_word">And followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>, where the exegetical clause is added, "To wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan") <span class="cmt_word">which made Israel to sin</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-26.htm">1 Kings 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-19.htm">1 Kings 16:19, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>, etc.); he departed not therefrom. This is emphatic. Jehoahaz kept up the worship to the full, and in no way suffered it to decline. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brief account of Hazael's campaign against Jerusalem is completed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23-24</a>. Hazael had gone down along the coast after defeating Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>), for the purpose of making war upon Judah also, and had taken Gath, which Rehoboam had fortified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). He then set his face, i.e., determined, to advance to Jerusalem; and Joash took the temple treasures, etc. According to the Chronicles, he sent an army against Judah and Jerusalem, which destroyed all the princes of the nation and sent much booty to the king to Damascus, as the small army of the Syrians had smitten the very large army of Judah. To protect Jerusalem, after this defeat, from being taken by the Syrians, Joash sent all the treasures of the temple and palace to Hazael, and so purchased the withdrawal of the Syrians. In this way the two brief accounts of the war may be both reconciled and explained; whereas the opinion, still repeated by Thenius, that the two passages treat of different wars, has no tenable ground to rest upon. The Philistian city of Gath (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>) appears to have belonged at that time to the kingdom of Judah, so that the Gathites were not among the Philistines who made an incursion into Judah in the reign of Joram along with the Arabian tribes of the south (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>). And it is impossible to determine when Gath was wrested from the Syrians again; probably in the time of Joash the son of Jehoahaz of Israel, as he recovered from the Syrians all the cities which they had taken from the Israelites under Jehoahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-25.htm">2 Kings 13:25</a>), and even smote Amaziah the king of Judaea at Bethshemesh and took him prisoner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a>.). "All the consecrated things, which Jehoshaphat, Joram, and Ahaziah had consecrated, and his own consecrated things," i.e., what he (Joash) himself had consecrated. The existence of such temple treasures is not at variance either with the previous account of the repairing of the temple, for Joash would not use the consecrated offerings for the restoration of the temple, as the current revenue of the temple was sufficient for the purpose, or with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>, where it is stated that Athaliah and her sons had applied all the &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; to the Baals (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>); for even if we are to understand by the sons of Athaliah not bastard sons (Ewald, Gesch. iii. p. 582), but the brethren of Joram whom the Philistines and Arabians had carried off, Ahaziah and Joram, although they both of them served Baal, may, from political considerations, have now and then made consecrated gifts to the temple, if only in a passing fit of religious fear. </body></html>
