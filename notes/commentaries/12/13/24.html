His reign synchronises with that of Samas-Rimmon in Assyria, who made no expeditions to the West (B.C. 825-812). The name Ben-hadad does not, of course, signify any connection with the dynasty overthrown by Hazael. It was a Divine title (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-24.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.">2Kings 6:24</a>.)<p>Benhadad was probably a feebler sovereign than Hazael. The rule, “Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis,” is perhaps as often contradicted as corroborated by actual experience.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:20-25 God has many ways to chastise a provoking people. Trouble comes sometimes from that point whence we least feared it. The mention of this invasion on the death of Elisha, shows that the removal of God's faithful prophets is a presage of coming judgments. His dead body was a means of giving life to another dead body. This miracle was a confirmation of his prophecies. And it may have reference to Christ, by whose death and burial, the grave is made a safe and happy passage to life to all believers. Jehoash was successful against the Syrians, just as often as he had struck the ground with the arrows, then a stop was put to his victories. Many have repented, when too late, of distrusts and the straitness of their desires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So Hazael ... died - literally, "And Hazael died," a fact not mentioned before. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. Elisha died&#8212;He had enjoyed a happier life than Elijah, as he possessed a milder character, and bore a less hard commission. His rough garment was honored even at the court.<p>coming in of the year&#8212;that is, the spring, the usual season of beginning campaigns in ancient times. Predatory bands from Moab generally made incursions at that time on the lands of Israel. The bearers of a corpse, alarmed by the appearance of one of these bands, hastily deposited, as they passed that way, their load in Elisha's sepulchre, which might be easily done by removing the stone at the mouth of the cave. According to the Jewish and Eastern custom, his body, as well as that of the man who was miraculously restored, was not laid in a coffin, but only swathed; so that the bodies could be brought into contact, and the object of the miracle was to stimulate the king's and people of Israel's faith in the still unaccomplished predictions of Elisha respecting the war with the Syrians. Accordingly the historian forthwith records the historical fulfilment of the prediction (2Ki 13:22-25), in the defeat of the enemy, in the recovery of the cities that had been taken, and their restoration to the kingdom of Israel.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Hazael the king of Syria died, and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.

This is the third Ben-hadad on the throne of Damascus. (Cf. Schrader, p. 109.)

It was an old royal name in Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), having been borne by at least two of Hazael's predecessors. The meaning which has been assigned to it ("Son of the sun") is doubtful. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Take-said Elisha to Joash-bow and arrows, ... and let thy hand pass over the bow" (&#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;), i.e., stretch the bow. He then placed his hands upon the king's hands, as a sign that the power which was to be given to the bow-shot came from the Lord through the mediation of the prophet. He then directed him to open the window towards the east and shoot, adding as he shot off the arrow: "An arrow of salvation from the Lord, and an arrow of salvation against the Syrians; and thou wilt smite the Syrians at Aphek (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26</a>) to destruction." The arrow that was shot off was to be a symbol of the help of the Lord against the Syrians to their destruction. This promise the king was then to appropriate to himself through an act of his own. Elisha therefore directed him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-18.htm">2 Kings 13:18</a>) to "take the arrows;" and when he had taken them, said: &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; &#1492;&#1498;, "strike to the earth," i.e., shoot the arrows to the ground, not "smite the earth with the bundle of arrows" (Thenius), which neither agrees with the shooting of the first arrow, nor admits of a grammatical vindication; for &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, when used of an arrow, signifies to shoot and to strike with the arrow shot off, i.e., to wound or to kill (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>). The shooting of the arrows to the earth was intended to symbolize the overthrow of the Syrians. "And the king shot three times, and then stood (still)," i.e., left off shooting.</body></html>
