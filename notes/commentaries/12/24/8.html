But as both the Syriac and Arabic versions in that place read <span class="ital">eighteen, </span>it seems most reasonable to believe that the transcriber of the book of Chronicles made a mistake, and wrote <span class="ital">eight </span>for eighteen. Poole, however, and many other commentators, suppose that both places are correct, and that in his eighth year he began to reign with his father, who made him king with him, as divers other kings of Israel and Judah had acted in times of trouble; and that in his eighteenth year he reigned alone. Jehoiachin’s succeeding his father in the throne of Judah may seem to disagree with the threat which the prophet denounces against his father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit on the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.">Jeremiah 36:30</a>, <span class="ital">He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; </span>but as Jehoiachin’s reign lasted little more than three months, during which time he was absolutely subject to the Chaldeans, a reign of so short continuance, and of so small authority, may well be looked upon as nothing: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-6.htm" title="And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.">Ezekiel 19:6</a>, &c.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:8-20 Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His mother's name - On the position of the "queen mother" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-10.htm">1 Kings 15:10</a> note.

And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.">2 Kings 23:36</a></span>; and so the first year of Jehoiachin was precisely the eighth year of that captivity. And this is certain, that the years of kings mentioned in Scripture are not always accounted from the beginning of their age, but from some other remarkable time or thing: thus Saul, when at man’s estate, is called <span class="ital">the son of one year</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm" title="Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,">1 Samuel 13:1</a></span>, of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm" title="Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,">1 Samuel 13:1</a>"</span> and Ahaziah (whose father lived only forty years, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-20.htm" title="Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired.

His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.">2 Chronicles 22:2</a></span>, because that was the forty and second year of the reign of Omri’s family, as most think. And therefore it cannot seem strange if the years of this king be computed, not from his birth but from the beginning of so great and famous a change of the Jewish affairs, as this captivity made; this being the usual way of the Romans and Greeks, and other more ancient and eastern nations, to compute the times from the great changes and revolutions happening among them. And that this was the practice of the Jews in the computation of these very times, is evident from the use of it in the Prophecy of Ezekiel, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a></span>, <span class="ital">which was the fifth year of Jehoiachin’s captivity</span>; and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm" title="And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten.">Ezekiel 33:21</a></span>, <span class="ital">in the twelfth year of our captivity</span>; and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-1.htm" title="In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was on me, and brought me thither.">Ezekiel 40:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> he is said to be but eight years old; which may be reconciled by observing, that he might be made and declared king by his father, in the first year of his reign, who reigned eleven years, so that he was eight years old when he began to reign with him, and eighteen when he began to reign alone (q). Dr. Lightfoot (r) gives another solution of this difficulty, that properly speaking he was eighteen years old when he began to reign, but, in an improper sense, the son of eight years, or the eighth year, as the Hebrew phrase is; that is, he fell in the lot of the eighth year of the captivity of Judah, which was in the latter end of the third, or the beginning of the fourth of his father's reign, and the first of Nebuchadnezzar's, and it was now in the eighth of Nebuchadnezzar that he was king, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>, but very probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> there is a mistake in the copyist of eight for eighteen, since in the Arabic and Syriac versions it is there eighteen, as here: <p>he reigned in Jerusalem three months; the ten days besides are here omitted for shortness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>. <p>and his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem; a person no doubt well known in those times. <p>(q) So in Seder Olam Rabba, c. 25.

The short reign of Jehoisshin is now described. It lasted but three months. For some reason which is unrecorded, Nebuchadnezzar, who had placed him on the throne, took offence at his conduct, and sent an army against him to effect his deposition. Jehoiachin offered scarcely any resistance. He "went out" of the city (ver. 12), with the queen-mother, the officers of the court, and the princes, and submitted himself to the will of the great king. But he gained nothing by his pusillanimity. The Babylonians entered Jerusalem, plundered the temple and the royal palace, made prisoners of the king, his mother, the princes and nobles, the armed garrison, and all the more skilled artisans, to the number altogether of ten thousand souls (Josephus says 10,832, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 1), and carried them captive to Babylon. Zedekiah, the king's uncle, was made monarch in his room. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> he is said to have been only eight years old, but this is probably an accidental corruption, the <span class="accented">yod</span>, which is the Hebrew sign for ten, easily slipping out. As he had "wives" (ver. 15) and "seed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>), he could not well be less than eighteen. <span class="cmt_word">And he reigned in Jerusalem three months.</span> "Three months and ten days," according to 2 Chronicles (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) and Josephus ('Ant.

His daughter, Nehushta - the Noste of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3) - was probably the ruling spirit of the time during her son's short reign. We find mention of her in Jeremiah 26:26; 29:2; and in Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3, and Jeremiah 10:7. &sect; 1. Ewald suggests that she "energetically supported" her son in the policy whereby he offended Nebuchadnezzar. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To punish Jehoiakim's rebellion, Jehovah sent hosts of Chaldaeans, Aramaeans, Moabites, and Ammonites against him and against Judah to destroy it (&#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;). Nebuchadnezzar was probably too much occupied with other matters relating to his kingdom, during the earliest years of his reign after his father's death, to be able to proceed at once against Jehoiakim and punish him for his revolt.<p>(Note: Compare the remarks of M. v. Niebuhr on this point (Gesch. pp. 208,209) and his summary at p. 209: "Nebuchadnezzar had enough to do in Babylon and the eastern half of his kingdom, to complete the organization of the new kingdom, to make the military roads to the western half of the kingdom along the narrow valley of the Euphrates and through the desert, and also to fortify them and provide them with watering stations and every other requisite, to repair the damages of the Scythian hordes and the long contest with Nineveh, to restore the shattered authority, and to bring Arabs and mountain-tribes to order. All this was more important than a somewhat more rapid termination of the Egyptian war and the pacification of Syria.")<p>He may also have thought it a matter of too little importance for him to go himself, as there was not much reason to be afraid of Egypt since its first defeat (cf. M. v. Niebuhr, p. 375). He therefore merely sent such troops against him as were in the neighbourhood of Judah at the time. The tribes mentioned along with the Chaldaeans were probably all subject to Nebuchadnezzar, so that they attacked Judah at his command in combination with the Chaldaean tribes left upon the frontier. How much they effected is not distinctly stated; but it is evident that they were not able to take Jerusalem, from the fact that after the death of Jehoiakim his son was able to ascend the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>). - The sending of these troops is ascribed to Jehovah, who, as the supreme controller of the fate of the covenant-nation, punished Jehoiakim for his rebellion. For, after the Lord had given Judah into the hands of the Chaldaeans as a punishment for its apostasy from Him, all revolt from them was rebellion against the Lord. "According to the word of Jehovah, which He spake by His servants the prophets," viz., Isaiah, Micah, Habakkuk, Jeremiah, and others.</body></html>
