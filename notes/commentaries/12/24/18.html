His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mattaniah, son of Josiah and brother of Jehoahaz, but thirteen years his junior, adopted a name significant of the blessings promised by Jeremiah to the reign of a king whose name should be "Yahweh, our righteousness" <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 24:17-20.

He was thus contemporary with Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon, with Cyaxares and Astyages in Media, and with Psamatik II. and Ua-ap-ra (Pharaoh-Hophra) in Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter  of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span> He was thus full  brother of Jehoahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>), but only  half-brother to Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). His father-in-law, "Jeremiah of Libnah" is not the prophet, who was of Anathoth. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then Jehoiachin went out to the king of Babylon to yield himself up to him, because he perceived the impossibility of holding the city any longer against the besiegers, and probably hoped to secure the favour of Nebuchadnezzar, and perhaps to retain the throne as his vassal by a voluntary submission. Nebuchadnezzar, however, did not show favour any more, as he had done to Jehoiakim at the first taking of Jerusalem, but treated Jehoiachin as a rebel, made him prisoner, and led him away to Babylon, along with his mother, his wives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>), his princes and his chamberlains, as Jeremiah had prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>.), in the eighth year of his (Nebuchadnezzar's) reign. The reference to the king's mother in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a> is not to be explained on the ground that she still acted as guardian over the king, who was not yet of age (J. D. Mich.), but from the influential position which she occupied in the kingdom as &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a> : see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>). The eighth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar is reckoned from the time when his father had transferred to him the chief command over the army to make war upon Necho, according to which his first year coincides with the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a>). As Nebuchadnezzar acted as king, so far as the Jews were concerned, from that time forward, although he conducted the war by command of his father, this is always reckoned as the point of time at which his reign commenced, both in our books and also in Jeremiah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-1.htm">Jeremiah 32:1</a>). According to this calculation, his reign lasted forty-four years, viz., the eight years of Jehoiakim and the thirty-six years of Jehoiachin's imprisonment, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>. </body></html>
