His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The eighth year - Jeremiah calls it the seventh year <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-28.htm">Jeremiah 52:28</a>, a statement which implies only a different manner of counting regnal years. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 24:10-16. Jerusalem Taken.<p>10-13. At that time&#8212;within three months after his accession to the throne. It was the spring of the year (2Ch 36:10); so early did he indicate a feeling hostile to the interests of his Assyrian liege lord, by forming a league with Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar sent his generals to besiege Jerusalem, as Jeremiah had foretold (Jer 22:28; 34:20), and soon after he followed in person. Convinced of the hopelessness of making any effectual resistance, Jehoiachin, going to the camp of the besiegers, surrendered (2Ki 24:12), in the expectation, probably, of being allowed to retain his throne as a vassal of the Assyrian empire. But Nebuchadnezzar's clemency towards the kings of Judah was now exhausted, so that Jehoiachin was sent as a captive to Babylon, according to Jeremiah's prediction (Jer 22:24), accompanied by the queen mother (the same who had held that dignity under Jehoahaz) (2Ki 23:31), his generals, and officers. This happened in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, computing from the time when he was associated with his father in the government. Those that were left consisted chiefly of the poorer sort of people and the unskilled workmen. The palace and the temple were ransacked. The smaller golden vessels had been taken on the first capture of Jerusalem and placed by Nebuchadnezzar in the temple of his god as tokens of victory. They were used by Belshazzar at his impious feast [Da 5:2], for the purpose of rewarding his army with these trophies, among which were probably the golden candlesticks, the ark, &c. (compare 2Ch 36:7; Da 1:2). Now the gold plating was torn off all the larger temple furniture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Went out to the king of Babylon, </span> i.e. yielded up himself and the city into his hands; and this by the counsel of Jeremiah, and to his own good. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of his reign, </span> i.e. of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign; as appears by comparing this with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-8.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts; Because you have not heard my words,">Jeremiah 25:8</a></span>, and because Jehoiachin reigned not half a year. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon,....

We know from Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;">Jeremiah 25:1</a>) that the fourth year of Jehoiakim was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar. So the time just admits of the three months’ reign of Jehoiachin, as his father reigned eleven years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-36.htm" title="And the burden of the LORD shall you mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.">Jeremiah 23:36</a>). In connexion with this captivity should be read the prophecy of Jeremiah 24 where under the type of good and bad figs, he speaks of the fate of the two sorts of people, those that are sent into the land of the Chaldæans for their good, and the rest, who like Zedekiah inclined to a league with Egypt. To this time belongs also Jeremiah’s letter to the captives, full of wise advice and comforting promises (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/29-1.htm" title="Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;...">Jeremiah 29:1-23</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiachin the King of Judah went out to the King of Babylon</span> (for the use of the expression, "went out to," in this sense of making a surrender, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-3.htm">1 Samuel 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17</a>, etc.), <span class="cmt_word">he, and his mother</span> (see the comment on ver. 8), <span class="cmt_word">and his servants, and his princes, and his officers</span> - rather, <span class="accented">his eunuchs</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 20:18) <span class="cmt_word">and the King of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.</span> Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father, Nabopelassar, in  <span class="date">B.C. 605</span>; but his first year was not complete till late in  <span class="date">B.C. 604</span>.

That this statement is not in contradiction to the prophecies of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a> : "Jehoiakim shall be buried like an ass, carried away and cast out far away from the gates of Jerusalem," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a> : "no son of his shall sit upon the throne of David, and his body shall lie exposed to the heat by day and to the cold by night," is now generally admitted, as it has already been by J. D. Michaelis and Winer. But the solution proposed by Michaelis, Winer, and M. v. Niebuhr (Gesch. p. 376) is not sufficient, namely, that at the conquest of Jerusalem, which took place three months after the death of Jehoiakim, his bones were taken out of the grave, either by the victors out of revenge for his rebellion, or by the fury of the people, and cast out before the city gate; for Jeremiah expressly predicts that he shall have no funeral and no burial whatever. We must therefore assume that he was slain in a battle fought with the troops sent against him, and was not buried at all; an assumption which is not at variance with the words, "he laid himself down to his fathers,"' since this formula does not necessarily indicate a peaceful death by sickness, but is also applied to king Ahab, who was slain in battle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-40.htm">1 Kings 22:40</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>).<p>(Note: The supposition of Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 733), that Jehoiakim was enticed out of the capital by a stratagem of the enemy, and taken prisoner, and because he made a furious resistance was hurried off in a scuffle and mercilessly slaughtered, is at variance with the fact that, according to v. 10, it was not till after his death that the army of the enemy advanced to the front of Jerusalem and commenced the siege.)<p> - And even though his son Jehoiachin ascended the throne after his father's death and maintained his position for three months against the Chaldaeans, until at length he fell into their hands and was carried away alive to Babylon, the prophet might very truly describe this short reign as not sitting upon the throne of David (cf. Graf on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). - To the death of Jehoiakim there is appended the notice in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>, that the king of Egypt did not go out of his own land any more, because the king of Babylon had taken away everything that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates. The purpose of this notice is to indicate, on the one hand, what attitude Necho, whose march to the Euphrates was previously mentioned, had assumed on the conquest of Judah by the Chaldaeans, and on the other hand, that under these circumstances a successful resistance to the Chaldaeans on the part of Judah was not for a moment to be thought of. </body></html>
