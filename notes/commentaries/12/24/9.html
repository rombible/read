Hitzig refers the passage to Zedekiah; and so Thenius.

His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His mother's name - On the position of the "queen mother" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-10.htm">1 Kings 15:10</a> note.

The present passage probably does not mean more than that he made no attempt at a religious reformation, but allowed the idolatries and superstitions which had prevailed under Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim to continue. It is in his favor that he did not actively persecute Jeremiah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1497;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1498;: "only according to the mouth (command) of Jehovah did this take place against Judah," i.e., for no other reason than because the Lord had determined to put away Judah from before His face because of Manasseh's sins (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12-16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-27.htm">2 Kings 23:27</a>).
