The text of Jeremiah is generally, though not always, the best.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">And he did that which was evil . . .</span>—The evidence of the prophet Jeremiah should be compared with this statement. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm" title="And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus said the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:">Jeremiah 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/37-1.htm" title="And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.">Jeremiah 37:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-5.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.">Jeremiah 38:5</a>, and Comp.

The contemporary state of religion is vividly reflected in the pages of Ezekiel (2Kings viii—11); who, moreover, denounces Zedekiah’s breach of faith with the king of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 17:11-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">According to all that Jehoiakim</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>—He is not compared with Jehoiachin, who only reigned three months.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:8-20 Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He did that which was evil - The character of Zedekiah seems to have been weak rather than wicked.

Zedekiah's Evil Reign.<p>17-19. the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his father's brother, king in his stead&#8212;Adhering to his former policy of maintaining a show of monarchy, Nebuchadnezzar appointed the third and youngest son of Josiah (1Ch 3:15), full brother of Jehoahaz, and uncle of the captive Jehoiachin. But, according to the custom of conquerors, who changed the names of the great men they took captives in war, in token of their supremacy, he gave him the new name of<p>Zedekiah&#8212;that is, "The righteous of God." This being a purely Hebrew name, it seems that he allowed the puppet king to choose his own name, which was confirmed. His heart towards God was the same as that of Jehoiakim, impenitent and heedless of God's word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Zedekiah was twenty years old when he began to reign,....

This and the two following verses are expressed in the same words as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-1.htm">Jeremiah 52:1</a>, (see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-1.htm">Jeremiah 52:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-2.htm">Jeremiah 52:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-3.htm">Jeremiah 52:3</a>), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>, besides what is here said, is written, that he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet of the Lord, that spoke in his name, but opposed him; and rebelling against the king of Babylon, broke his oath, and hardened his neck and heart against the Lord, and was obstinate, stubborn, and self-willed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">according to all that Jehoiakim had done</span>] For Jehoiakim’s character, see above on verse 5.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span> Keil says, "His attitude towards the Lord exactly resembled that of his brother Jehoiakim, except that Zedekiah does not appear to have possessed so much energy for that which was evil." He allowed the people to continue their "pollutions" and" abominations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). He let the "princes" have their way, and do whatever they pleased (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-5.htm">Jeremiah 38:5</a>), contenting himself with sometimes outwitting them, and counteracting their proceeding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14-28</a>). He fell into the old error of "putting trust in Egypt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-7</a>), and made an alliance with Apries (Pharaoh-Hophra), which was an act of rebellion, at once against God and against his Babylonian suzerain. He was, upon the whole, rather weak than wicked; but his weakness was as ruinous to his country as active wickedness would have been. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nebuchadnezzar thereupon, that is to say, when he had forced his way into the city, plundered the treasures of the temple and palace, and broke the gold off the vessels which Solomon had made in the temple of Jehovah. &#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1509;, to cut off, break off, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>, i.e., to bear off the gold plates. Nebuchadnezzar had already taken a portion of the golden vessels of the temple away with him at the first taking of Jerusalem in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, and had placed them in the temple of his god at Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm">2 Chronicles 36:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>). They were no doubt the smaller vessels of solid gold-basins, scoops, goblets, knives, tongs, etc., - which Cyrus delivered up again to the Jews on their return to their native land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7</a>.). This time he took the gold off the larger vessels, which were simply plated with that metal, such as the altar of burnt-offering, the table of shew-bread and ark of the covenant, and carried it away as booty, so that on the third conquest of Jerusalem, in the time of Zedekiah, beside a few gold and silver basins and scoops (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>) there were only the large brazen vessels of the court remaining (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-18.htm">Jeremiah 27:18</a>.).
