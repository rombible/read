Their ravages were understood by the colonists as a token of the wrath of the local deity on account of their neglect of his worship. The sacred writer endorses this interpretation of the incident, probably remembering <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm" title="I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.">Leviticus 26:22</a>.

But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change.

The colonists regarded their sufferings from the lions as a judgment upon them from "the god of the land" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-26.htm">2 Kings 17:26</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-23.htm">1 Kings 20:23</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-28. the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, etc.&#8212;This was not Shalmaneser, but Esar-haddon (Eze 4:2).

A remnant was left, chiefly however of the poor and lower classes, with whom these foreign colonists mingled; so that the prevailing character of society about Samaria was heathen, not Israelite. For the Assyrian colonists became masters of the land; and, forming partial intermarriages with the remnant Jews, the inhabitants became a mongrel race, no longer a people of Ephraim (Isa 7:6). These people, imperfectly instructed in the creed of the Jews, acquired also a mongrel doctrine. Being too few to replenish the land, lions, by which the land had been infested (Jud 14:5; 1Sa 17:34; 1Ki 13:24; 20:36; So 4:8), multiplied and committed frequent ravages upon them. Recognizing in these attacks a judgment from the God of the land, whom they had not worshipped, they petitioned the Assyrian court to send them some Jewish priests who might instruct them in the right way of serving Him. The king, in compliance with their request, sent them one of the exiled priests of Israel [2Ki 17:27], who established his headquarters at Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the Lord. It is not said that he took a copy of the Pentateuch with him, out of which he might teach them. Oral teaching was much better fitted for the superstitious people than instruction out of a written book. He could teach them more effectually by word of mouth. Believing that he would adopt the best and simplest method for them, it is unlikely that he took the written law with him, and so gave origin to the Samaritan copy of the Pentateuch [Davidson, Criticism]. Besides, it is evident from his being one of the exiled priests, and from his settlement at Beth-el, that he was not a Levite, but one of the calf-worshipping priests. Consequently his instructions would be neither sound nor efficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They feared not the Lord; </span> they did not acknowledge nor worship God in any sort. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore; </span> for this gross neglect and contempt of God, which was contrary to the principles and practices of the heathens, who used to worship the gods of the nations where they lived, and gave that honour to their false gods which here they denied to the true.

This statement must be considered as the thought of the people themselves. How far it might also be shared by the writer of Kings we cannot know. These heathen people having regarded their own divinities as especially attached to certain places, would consider that Israel had also its own local deity. Him and His worship they were ignorant of, and when the wild beasts increased upon them it was a natural idea with them to regard the plague as inflicted by the god of the country. That wild beasts were not uncommon in the Holy Land at this period we can see from other places of the history, and when the land was less thickly populated, such beasts as remained would have more chance of multiplying.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the Lord.</span> They were ignorant, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Jehovah, and paid him no religious regard. They brought with them their own forms of heathenism (see vers. 30, 31). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the Lord sent lions among them.</span> Lions are not now found in Palestine, nor indeed in any part of Syria, though they are numerous in Mesopotamia; but anciently they appear to have been tolerably common in all parts of the Holy Land (see the comment on 1 Kings 13:24). We may gather from what is said here that, though new settlers had been brought into the country by the Assyrians, yet still there had been a considerable decrease in the population, which had been favorable to the lions multiplying. The new settlers, it is to be noted, were placed in the towns (ver. 24); and it is probable that many of the country districts lay waste and desolate. Still, the writer views the <span class="accented">great</span> increase in the number of the lions as a Divine judgment, which it may have been, though based upon a natural circumstance. <span class="cmt_word">Which slew some of them.</span> (For the great boldness of the Palestinian lion, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-36.htm">1 Kings 20:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-13.htm">Proverbs 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>, etc.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This conduct excited the anger of God, so that He removed them from His face, and only left the tribe (i.e., the kingdom) of Judah, although Judah also did not keep the commandments of the Lord and walked in the statutes of Israel, and therefore had deserved rejection. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-19.htm">2 Kings 17:19</a> contains a parenthesis occasioned by &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; &#1512;&#1511; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>).
