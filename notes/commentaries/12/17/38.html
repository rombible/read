But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which he wrote for you - It is worth observing here, first, that the author regards the whole Law as given to the Israelites in a written form; and secondly, that he looks on the real writer as God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. Unto this day&#8212;the time of the Babylonian exile, when this book was composed. Their religion was a strange medley or compound of the service of God and the service of idols. Such was the first settlement of the people, afterwards called Samaritans, who were sent from Assyria to colonize the land, when the kingdom of Israel, after having continued three hundred fifty-six years, was overthrown.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the covenant that I have made with you, ye shall not forget,....

This was the covenant which Israel had been warned so frequently not to "forget" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-13.htm">Deuteronomy 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>), yet which they had "forgotten," or, at any rate, "forsaken," as already declared in ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall ye fear other gods.</span> The writer has probably a practical object in his reiteration. He expects his words to reach the ears of the mixed race inhabiting Samaria in his day, and would fain warn them against their idolatrous practices, and point them to the pure worship of Jehovah. It is pleasing to remember that ultimately the mixed race was won to the true faith, and that the Samaritans of our Lord's time were as true worshippers of Jehovah, and as zealous followers of the Law, as the Jews themselves. The interesting community at Nablous still maintains Samaritan forms, and reads the Samaritan Pentateuch. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In addition to these idols, Jehovah also was worshipped in temples of the high places, according to the instructions of the Israelitish priest sent by the king of Assyria. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;: "and they were (also) worshipping Jehovah, and made themselves priests of the mass of the people" (&#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>). &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;: "and they (the priests) were preparing them (sacrifices) in the houses of the high places."</body></html>
