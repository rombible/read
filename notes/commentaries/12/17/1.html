Hoshea's Wicked Reign.<p>1. In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, began Hoshea &#8230; to reign&#8212;The statement in 2Ki 15:30 may be reconciled with the present passage in the following manner: Hoshea conspired against Pekah in the twentieth year of the latter, which was the eighteenth of Jotham's reign. It was two years before Hoshea was acknowledged king of Israel, that is, in the fourth of Ahaz, and twentieth of Jotham. In the twelfth year of Ahaz his reign began to be tranquil and prosperous [Calmet].Hoshea king of Israel, his wicked reign: being subdued by Shalmaneser king of Assyria, he conspireth against him with So king of Egypt: he is besieged; taken prisoner; and with all the people carried captive to Assyria for their sins, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/17-1.htm" title="In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years....">2 Kings 17:1-23</a></span>.

In this account there is some difficulty, since it was in the twentieth of Jotham, that is, the fourth of Ahaz, that Hosea conspired against Pekah king of Israel, and slew him, when it might be reasonably thought he began his reign: now either there was an interregnum until the twelfth of Ahaz, or Hoshea however was not generally received and acknowledged as king till then, as others think; he being a tributary to the king of Assyria, and a kind of viceroy, is not said to reign until he rebelled against him; after which he reigned nine years, four in the times of Ahaz, and five in the reign of Hezekiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9</a>, in this way the author of the Jewish chronology goes (r), in which he is followed by other Jewish writers; and this bids as fair as any to remove the difficulty, unless these nine years refer to the time of his reign before the twelfth of Ahaz; and the sense be, that in the twelfth of Ahaz he had reigned nine year's; but it is said he "began" to reign then. <p>(r) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 22. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/17-1.htm" title="In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years....">2 Kings 17:1-6</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm" title="And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.">2 Kings 15:30</a> Hoshea is said to have begun to reign in the twentieth year of Jotham. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-33.htm" title="Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.">2 Kings 15:33</a> Jotham’s reign is stated to have been only sixteen years, the two statements are contradictory. Moreover we find that Pekah was not slain in Jotham’s reign, but was an active monarch in the days of Ahaz. The reconciliation of the various statements is full of difficulty. See chronological notice.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the twelfth year of Ahaz King of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a> Hoshea was said to have smitten Pekah and slain him, and become king in his stead, "in <span class="accented">the twentieth year of Jotham</span>." This has been supposed to mean "in the twentieth year from the accession of Jotham," or, in other words, in the fourth year of Ahaz, since Jotham reigned only sixteen years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-33.htm">2 Kings 15:33</a>). But now the beginning of his reign is placed eight years later. An interregnum of this duration has been placed by some between Pekah and Doshea; but this is contradicted by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, and also by an inscription of Tiglath-pileser ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123,124, lines 17, 18). If Ahaz reigned sixteen years, the present statement would seem to be correct, and the former one wrong. Hoshea's accession may be confidently dated as in  <span class="date">B.C. 730</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Nine years</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-10.htm">2 Kings 18:10</a>). It is certain that Hoshea's reign came to an end in the first year of Sargon,  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, from which to  <span class="date">B.C. 730</span> would be eight complete, or nine incomplete, years. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He also commanded that the daily morning and evening sacrifice, and the special offerings of the king and the people, should be presented upon the new altar, and thereby put a stop to the use of the Solomonian altar, "about which he would consider." The Chethb &#1493;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be altered; the pron. suff. stands before the noun, as is frequently the case in the more diffuse popular speech. The new altar is called "the great altar," probably because it was somewhat larger than that of Solomon. &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1512;: used for the burning of the sacrifices. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; is not merely the meat-offering offered in the evening, but the whole of the evening sacrifice, consisting of a burnt-offering and a meat-offering, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-29.htm">1 Kings 18:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>. &#1500;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1497;, the brazen altar "will be to me for deliberation," i.e., I will reflect upon it, and then make further arrangements. On &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512; in this sense see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a>. In the opinion of Ahaz, the altar which had been built after the model of that of Damascus was not to be an idolatrous altar, but an altar of Jehovah. The reason for this arbitrary removal of the altar of Solomon, which had been sanctified by the Lord Himself at the dedication of the temple by fire from heaven, was, in all probability, chiefly that the Damascene altar pleased Ahaz better; and the innovation was a sin against Jehovah, inasmuch as God Himself had prescribed the form for His sanctuary (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-30.htm">Exodus 26:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>), so that any altar planned by man and built according to a heathen model was practically the same as an idolatrous altar. - The account of this altar is omitted from the Chronicles; but in v. 23 we have this statement instead: "Ahaz offered sacrifice to the gods of Damascus, who smote him, saying, The gods of the kings of Aram helped them; I will sacrifice to them that they may help me: and they were the ruin of him and of all Israel." Thenius and Bertheau find in this account an alteration of our account of the copying of the Damascene altar introduced by the chronicler as favouring his design, namely, to give as glaring a description as possible of the ungodliness of Ahaz. But they are mistaken. For even if the notice in the Chronicles had really sprung from this alone, the chronicler would have been able from the standpoint of the Mosaic law to designate the offering of sacrifice upon the altar built after the model of an idolatrous Syrian altar as sacrificing to these gods. But it is a question whether the chronicler had in his mind merely the sacrifices offered upon that altar in the temple-court, and not rather sacrifices which Ahaz offered upon some bamah to the gods of Syria, when he was defeated and oppressed by the Syrians, for the purpose of procuring their assistance. As Ahaz offered his son in sacrifice to Moloch according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>, he might just as well have offered sacrifice to the gods of the Syrians. </body></html>
