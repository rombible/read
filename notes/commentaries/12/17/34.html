But, adds the historian, <span class="ital">they feared not the Lord — </span>Their pretended fear of him, and serving him together with their idols, was not worthy of the name of piety, or the fear of the Lord: nor would God accept such a mongrel religion and false worship as they offered to him. <span class="ital">Neither do they after their statutes — </span>God’s law delivered to the Israelites, and to them as their inheritance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm" title="Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.">Psalm 119:111</a>.

But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change.

Unto this day&#8212;the time of the Babylonian exile, when this book was composed. Their religion was a strange medley or compound of the service of God and the service of idols. Such was the first settlement of the people, afterwards called Samaritans, who were sent from Assyria to colonize the land, when the kingdom of Israel, after having continued three hundred fifty-six years, was overthrown.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto this day they do; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

So the sense of the place is this, As the Israelites before their captivity gave these nations an ill example, in serving the Lord and Baal together; so, or <span class="ital">after their former manner, they do unto this day</span>, in the land of their captivity. <span class="ital">They fear not the Lord</span>; though they pretended to fear and serve both the Lord and idols, yet in truth they did not, and do not fear or worship the Lord, but their own calves, or other vain inventions; and God will not accept that mongrel and false worship, which they pretend to give to the true God. Or this may intimate that the Israelites were worse than their successors, because these feared the Lord and idols too; but they did quite cast off the fear and worship of God in their captivity, and wholly degenerate into heathenish idolatry. <span class="ital">Their statutes</span>, i.e. God’s law delivered to their fathers, and to them, as their inheritance, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-111.htm" title="Your testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.">Psalm 119:111</a></span>.

God will not be served from policy. There need be no difficulty in understanding the words here in contrast to ‘they feared the Lord’ in verses 32, 33, 41. These latter express what the new colonists thought they were doing, and what they also thought to be enough. This verse expresses what the writer knew to be the truth as God regarded the service.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither do they after their statutes</span>] ‘Their’ refers by anticipation to ‘the children of Jacob’, who are mentioned at the close of the verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after the law and commandment</span>] As the preposition is twice expressed in Hebrew, R.V. has <span class="bld">or after the commandment</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whom he named Israel</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm" title="And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.">Genesis 32:28</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto this day</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the time at which Kings was written (about  <span class="date">B.C. 580-560</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">they do after the former manners</span>  - that is, they maintain the mixed religion, which they set up on the coming of the Samaritan priest from Assyria a hundred and fifty or sixty years previously - <span class="cmt_word">they fear not the Lord.</span> This statement seems directly opposed to the thrice-repeated one (vers. 32, 33, 41), "They feared the Lord;" but the apparent contradiction is easily reconciled. The new immigrants "feared Jehovah" in a certain sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> externally. They admitted him into their pantheon, and had ritual observances in his honor. But they did not really fear him in their hearts. Had they done so, they would have inquired what were his laws, statutes, and ordinances, and would have set themselves to obey them.

The settlers regarded this as a punishment from Jehovah, i.e., from the deity of the land, whom they did not worship, and therefore asked the king of Assyria for a priest to teach them the right, i.e., the proper, worship of God of the land; whereupon the king sent them one of the priests who had been carried away, and he took up his abode in Bethel, and instructed the people in the worship of Jehovah. The author of our books also looked upon the lions as sent by Jehovah as a punishment, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>, because the new settlers did not fear Him. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;: the lions which had taken up their abode there. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;: that they (the priest with his companions) went away and dwelt there. There is no need therefore to alter the plural into the singular.<p>The priest sent by the Assyrian king was of course an Israelitish priest of the calves, for he was one of those who had been carried away and settled in Bethel, the chief seat of Jeroboam's image-worship, and he also taught the colonists to fear or worship Jehovah after the manner of the land. This explains the state of divine worship in the land as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>. "Every separate nation (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;: see Ewald, 313, a.) made itself its own gods, and set them up in the houses of the high places (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;: see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>, and for the singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, Ewald, 270, c.) which the Samaritans (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, not the colonists sent thither by Esarhaddon, but the former inhabitants of the kingdom of Israel, who are so called from the capital Samaria) had made (built); every nation in the cities where they dwelt."</body></html>
