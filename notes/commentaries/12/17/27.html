But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change.

The priest would require to be accompanied by assistants, who would "go and dwell," but would not be qualified to "teach." The arcana of the worship would be known to none excepting the priests who had ministered at the two national sanctuaries of Dan and Bethel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-28. the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, etc.&#8212;This was not Shalmaneser, but Esar-haddon (Eze 4:2).

A remnant was left, chiefly however of the poor and lower classes, with whom these foreign colonists mingled; so that the prevailing character of society about Samaria was heathen, not Israelite. For the Assyrian colonists became masters of the land; and, forming partial intermarriages with the remnant Jews, the inhabitants became a mongrel race, no longer a people of Ephraim (Isa 7:6). These people, imperfectly instructed in the creed of the Jews, acquired also a mongrel doctrine. Being too few to replenish the land, lions, by which the land had been infested (Jud 14:5; 1Sa 17:34; 1Ki 13:24; 20:36; So 4:8), multiplied and committed frequent ravages upon them. Recognizing in these attacks a judgment from the God of the land, whom they had not worshipped, they petitioned the Assyrian court to send them some Jewish priests who might instruct them in the right way of serving Him. The king, in compliance with their request, sent them one of the exiled priests of Israel [2Ki 17:27], who established his headquarters at Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the Lord. It is not said that he took a copy of the Pentateuch with him, out of which he might teach them. Oral teaching was much better fitted for the superstitious people than instruction out of a written book. He could teach them more effectually by word of mouth. Believing that he would adopt the best and simplest method for them, it is unlikely that he took the written law with him, and so gave origin to the Samaritan copy of the Pentateuch [Davidson, Criticism]. Besides, it is evident from his being one of the exiled priests, and from his settlement at Beth-el, that he was not a Levite, but one of the calf-worshipping priests. Consequently his instructions would be neither sound nor efficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">One of the priests, </span> i.e. one of the chief of the priests, with others, to be under his inspection and direction, as may be gathered from the following words; where it is said of the same person, or persons, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">let them go, </span>& c., and then, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">let him teach, </span>& c.

A priest of the Israelitish worship was clearly the right person to be sent. No doubt all the priests were among the population that had been carried away. Hence the few Israelites left behind would not be regarded as capable of instructing the new colonists. For among the heathen, ‘the manner’, i.e. the ceremonial and particular observances in performing worship, was the matter of highest import. The less spiritual the worship, the more it tends to lay weight on the ‘manner’ and mode of the worship. Hence the magnificence so usual in idolatrous countries. The LXX. does not represent the words ‘one of the priests’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let them go</span>] The priest would not be expected to go alone. For such services as the king of Assyria had in his thoughts the person ministering must be attended by a body of minor people to add grandeur to the ceremonies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and let him teach</span>] The priest would naturally be the teacher. Hence we can see the reason of the change of number in the pronouns in this clause and the last.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the King of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence.</span> It does not appear that this was a suggestion of the colonists. Either it was the king's own idea, or that of one of his advisers. The priests, who ministered at the two national sanctuaries - those of Dan and Bethel - had, as important personages, been all carried off. Though a "remnant" of Israel was left in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>), they were probably of the baser sort (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>), or at any rate could not be trusted to know the details and intricacies of the Samaritan ritual. Thus it was necessary to send back a priest. <span class="cmt_word">And let them go and dwell there.</span> We should have expected, "Let him go;" but the writer assumes that the priest would have an <span class="accented">entourage</span>, assistant-ministers and servants, and so says, "Let them go;" but immediately afterwards, <span class="cmt_word">And let him teach</span> - since he alone would be competent - <span class="cmt_word">them the manner of the God of the land.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1511;&#1512;&#1506; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: "for He (Jehovah) rent Israel from the house of David." This view is apparently more correct than that Israel rent the kingdom from the house of David, not only because it presupposes too harsh an ellipsis to supply &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;, but also because we never meet with the thought that Israel rent the kingdom from the house of David, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a> it is simply stated that Jehovah rent the kingdom from Solomon; and to this our verse refers, whilst the following words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is explanatory: the Lord delivered up His people to the plunderers, for He rent Israel from the house of David as a punishment for the idolatry of Solomon, and the Israelites made Jeroboam king, who turned Israel away from Jehovah, etc. The Chethb &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1488; is to be read &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;, the Hiphil of &#1504;&#1491;&#1488;  equals  &#1504;&#1491;&#1492;, "he caused to depart away from the Lord." The Keri &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, Hiphil of &#1504;&#1491;&#1495;, he drove away, turned from the Lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>), is not unusual, but it is an unnecessary gloss.</body></html>
