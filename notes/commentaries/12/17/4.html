Hoshea's application to him was a return to a policy which had been successful in the reign of Jeroboam I((<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a> note), but had not been resorted to by any other Israelite monarch. Egypt had for many years been weak, but Sabaco was a conqueror, who at the head of the swarthy hordes of Ethiopia had invaded Egypt and made himself master of the country. In the inscriptions of Shebek he boasts to have received tribute from "the king of Shara" (Syria), which is probably his mode of noticing Hoshea's application. References to the Egyptian proclivities of Hoshea are frequent in the prophet Hosea Hos 7:11; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-5.htm">Hosea 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>.

But Shalmaneser, marching against [Hoshea], scoured the whole country of Israel, besieged the capital Samaria, and carried the principal inhabitants into captivity in his own land, having taken the king himself, and imprisoned him for life. This ancient policy of transplanting a conquered people into a foreign land, was founded on the idea that, among a mixed multitude, differing in language and religion, they would be kept in better subjection, and have less opportunity of combining together to recover their independence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">So king of Egypt; </span> by heathen writers called <span class="ital">Sua</span> or <span class="ital">Sabachus</span>; that by his assistance he might shake off the yoke of the king of Assyria; who now was, and for many years had been, the king of Egypt’s rival: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-21.htm" title="Now, behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.">2 Kings 18:21</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-5.htm" title="And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:">Jeremiah 36:5</a></span>.

The identification of this monarch is somewhat doubtful. The most probable supposition is that he is the same with either Shebek or Shebetek, the first and second kings of the Ethiopian twenty-fifth dynasty. By Manetho this king is named Sabachon, and in the Assyrian records (Smith, <span class="ital">Assyrian Canon</span>, p. 126) there appears an Egyptian general, whose name is represented as <span class="ital">Sibakhi</span> or <span class="ital">Sibahe</span>. He is represented as helping the king of Gaza against Assyria and being overthrown. This may be the person here spoken of. We can see at any rate that Egyptian influence extended as far as Palestine at this period, and therefore that Hoshea might very likely be tempted to seek aid in that quarter in the hope that he would find a less grasping superior lord than Shalmaneser.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and brought</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">offered</span>] <span class="ital">no present</span>] As the word for ‘present’ here and in verse 3 is the usual one for the ‘meal-offering’ (see note above) so the verb employed here is that which is constant in the accounts of ‘offering’ sacrifices. Hence the change. The verb in its application to sacrifices is found <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm" title="And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm" title="And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.">Exodus 24:5</a>, <span class="ital">et sacpe</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as</span> he had done <span class="ital">year by year</span>] The LXX. has ‘in that year’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the king of Assyria shut him up</span>] The LXX. gives <span class="greekheb">ἐπολιόρκησεν αὐτόν</span>, i.e. ‘besieged him’, referring the shutting up to the effect of a siege. But this sense is not warranted by the use of the verb elsewhere. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-1.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,">Jeremiah 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-5.htm" title="And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:">Jeremiah 36:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm" title="Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,">Jeremiah 39:15</a>, which all refer to imprisonment.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So, King of Egypt.</span> We learn from the Prophet Hosea that the expediency of calling in Egypt as a counterpoise to Assyria had long been in the thoughts of those who directed the policy of the Israelite state (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>, etc.). Now at last the plunge was taken. An Ethiopian dynasty of some strength and vigor had possession of Egypt, and held its court during some part of the year at Memphis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>). The king who occupied the throne was called Shabak or Shebek - a name which the Greeks represented by Sabakos or Sevechus, and the Hebrews by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>. (The original vocalization of this word was probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Seveh</span>; but in later times this vocalization was lost, and the Masorites pointed the word as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Soh</span> or So). The Assyrians knew the king as Sibakhi, and contended with him under Sargon. Hoshea now sent an embassy to this monarch's court, requesting his alliance and his support against the great Asiatic power by which the existence of all the petty states of Western Asia was threatened. Shalmaneser was at the time endeavoring to capture Tyro, and Hoshea might reasonably fear that, when Tyre was taken, his own turn would come. It is not clear how Shabak received Hoshea's overtures; but we may, perhaps, assume that it was with favor, since otherwise Hoshea would scarcely have ventured to withhold his tribute, as he seems to have done. It must have been in reliance on "the strength of Egypt" that he ventured to brave the anger of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">And brought no present</span> - or, <span class="accented">sent no tribute - <span class="cmt_word"></span>to the King of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the King of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</span> The ultimate result is mentioned at once, before the steps by which it was accomplished are related. Shalmaneser did not "summon Hoshea before his presence to listen to his explanations," and then, "as soon as he came, take him prisoner, put him in chains, and imprison him" (as Ewald thinks), but simply declared war, invaded Hoshea's country, besieged him in his capital, and ultimately, when he surrendered, consigned him to a prison, as Nebuchadnezzar afterwards did Jehoiachin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Otherwise Hoshea's reign would have come to an end in his sixth or seventh, and not in his ninth year. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The covered Sabbath-stand, which they had built in the house (temple), and the outer entrance of the king he turned (i.e., removed) into the house of Jehovah before the king of Assyria." &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1502;&#1497;&#1505;&#1498; (Keri &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1498;, from &#1505;&#1499;&#1498;, to cover) is no doubt a covered place, stand or hall in the court of the temple, to be used by the king whenever he visited the temple with his retinue on the Sabbath or on feast-days; and "the outer entrance of the king" is probably the special ascent into the temple for the king mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>. In what the removal of it consisted it is impossible to determine, from the want of information as to its original character. According to Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 621) and Thenius, &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; means, "he altered (these places), i.e., he robbed them of their ornaments, in the house of Jehovah." This is quite arbitrary. For even if &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; could mean "in the house of Jehovah" in this connection, &#1492;&#1505;&#1489; does not mean to disfigure, and still less "to deprive of ornaments." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a> it signifies to alter the name, not to disfigure it. Again, &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, "for fear of the king of Assyria," cannot mean, in this connection, "to make presents to the king of Assyria." And with this explanation, which is grammatically impossible, the inference drawn from it, namely, that Ahaz sent the ornaments of the king's stand and king's ascent to the king of Assyria along with the vessels mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>, also falls to the ground. If the alterations which Ahaz made in the stands and the brazen sea had any close connection with his relation to Tiglath-pileser, which cannot be proved, Ahaz must have been impelled by fear to make them, not that he might send them as presents to him, but that he might hide them from him if he came to Jerusalem, to which <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20-21</a> seems to refer. It is also perfectly conceivable, as Zllich (Die Cherubimwagen, p. 56) conjectures, that Ahaz merely broke off the panels from the stands and removed the oxen from the brazen sea, that he might use these artistic works to decorate some other place, possibly his palace. - Whether these artistic works were restored or not at the time of Hezekiah's reformation or in that of Josiah, we have no accounts to show. All that can be gathered from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-19.htm">Jeremiah 27:19</a>, is, that the stands and the brazen sea were still in existence in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, and that on the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans they were broken in pieces and carried away to Babylonia as brass. The brazen oxen are also specially mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm">Jeremiah 52:20</a>, which is not the case in the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13</a>; though this does not warrant the conclusion that they were no longer in existence at that time. </body></html>
