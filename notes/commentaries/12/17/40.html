But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which he wrote for you - It is worth observing here, first, that the author regards the whole Law as given to the Israelites in a written form; and secondly, that he looks on the real writer as God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34.

They had heard, from the priest sent to them, an account of the Lord the God of Israel, and of what He had done for His people. For though the priest was probably one of the ministers before the calves, he would point, through them, to the God who brought Israel out of Egypt. This the writer appears to think should have moved the newcomers to regard Jehovah as far above any local deity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit they did not hearken.</span> The mixed race, with their mixed religion, though professing to be worshippers of Jehovah, paid no attention to the warnings and threatenings of the Law (ver. 34), which were to them a dead letter. <span class="cmt_word">But they did after their former manner</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they continued to maintain the syncretism described in vers. 28-33. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This mixed cultus, composed of the worship of idols and the worship of Jehovah, they retained till the time when the books of the Kings were written.

The prophetic historian observes still further, that "they fear not Jehovah, and do not according to their statutes and their rights, nor according to the law and commandment which the Lord had laid down for the sons of Jacob, to whom He gave the name of Israel" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>), i.e., according to the Mosaic law. &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1501; "their statutes and their right," stands in antithesis to &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; which Jehovah gave to the children of Israel. If, then, the clause, "they do not according to their statutes and their right," is not to contain a glaring contradiction to the previous assertion, "unto this day they do after their first (former) rights," we must understand by &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1501; &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; the statutes and the right of the ten tribes, i.e., the worship of Jehovah under the symbols of the calves, and must explain the inexactness of the expression "their statutes and their right" from the fact that the historian was thinking of the Israelites who had been left behind in the land, or of the remnant of the Israelitish population that had become mixed up with the heathen settlers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-19.htm">2 Kings 23:19-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>). The meaning of the verse is therefore evidently the following: The inhabitants of Samaria retain to this day the cultus composed of the worship of idols and of Jehovah under the form of an image, and do not worship Jehovah either after the manner of the ten tribes or according to the precepts of the Mosaic law. Their worship is an amalgamation of the Jehovah image-worship and of heathen idolatry (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-41.htm">2 Kings 17:41</a>). - To indicate the character of this worship still more clearly, and hold it up as a complete breach of the covenant and as utter apostasy from Jehovah, the historian describes still more fully, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-35.htm">2 Kings 17:35-39</a>, how earnestly and emphatically the people of Israel had been prohibited from worshipping other gods, and urged to worship Jehovah alone, who had redeemed Israel out of Egypt and exalted it into His own nation.
