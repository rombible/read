It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a> note, and see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2-5</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 17:7-41.

No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Sold themselves to do evil; </span> of which phrase <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm" title="And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy?

The sin of child-murder had not Been previously laid to the charge of Israel; but, as it had infected Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>), there is no reason why it should not have invaded also the sister kingdom.

It was an old sin of the Canaanitish nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, etc.), and continued to be practiced by the Moabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a>) and Ammonites, neighbors of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">And used divination and enchantments.</span> The "witchcrafts" of Jezebel have been already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>). Magical practices always accompanied idolatry, and were of many kinds. Sometimes divination was by means of staves or rods (rhabdomancy), which were manipulated in various ways (Herod., 4:67; Schol. ad Nicandr., 'Theriac.,' 613; Tacit., 'German.,' &sect; 10; Atom. Marc., 31:2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>). Sometimes it was by arrows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>). Very often, especially in Greece and Rome, it was by inspecting the entrails of victims. Where faith in God wanes, a trust in magical practices, astrology, chiromancy, "sertes Virgilianae," horoscopes, spirit-rapping, and the like, almost always supervenes. <span class="cmt_word">And sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.</span> (On the expression, "sold themselves to do evil," see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And burned incense there upon all the high places, like the nations which Jehovah drove out before them." &#1492;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492;, lit., to lead into exile, is applied here to the expulsion and destruction of the Canaanites, with special reference to the banishment of the Israelites.</body></html>
