It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As idols are "vanity" and "nothingness," mere weakness and impotence, so idolators are "vain" and impotent. Their energies have been wasted, their time misspent; they have missed the real object of their existence; their whole life has been a mistake; and the result is utter powerlessness. Literally, the word rendered "vanity" seems to mean "breath" or "vapor" - a familiar image for nonentity. It occurs frequently in the prophets, and especially in Jeremiah (e. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-19.htm">Jeremiah 8:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>, etc.). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 17:7-41.

No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They followed vanity, </span> i.e. idols; oft so called, because of their nothingness, impotency, and unprofitableness; and to show the folly and madness of idolaters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Became vain</span> by the long worship of idols, they were made like them, vain, sottish, and senseless creatures. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers,....

Rejecting the "statutes" of God was thus rejecting the "covenant." <span class="cmt_word">And his testimonies which he testified against them.</span> The "testimonies" of God are his commandments, considered as witnessing of him and setting forth his nature. The use of the term is common in Deuteronomy and in the Psalms, but otherwise rare. <span class="cmt_word">And they followed vanity, and became vain.</span> False gods are "vanity;" false religions are "vanity;" there is nothing firm or substantial about them; they belong to the realm of futility and nothingness. And the followers of such religions derive weakness from them  - they "become vain " - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> weak, futile, impotent. Their energies are wasted; they effect nothing of that which they wish to effect; they are completely powerless for good, at any rate; and they are not really powerful for evil. Their plans, for the most part, miscarry; and "their end is destruction." <span class="cmt_word">And went after the heathen that were round about them.</span> Upon a neglect to keep God's commandments follows active revolt from him, and the doing of that which he has forbidden. When they rejected God's statutes, the Israelites adopted "the statutes of the heathen" (ver. 8), and "walked in them." <span class="cmt_word">Concerning whom the Lord had charged them, that they should not do like them</span> (see above, ver. 12, and compare the comment on ver. 8). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;: "they covered words which were not right concerning Jehovah their God," i.e., they sought to conceal the true nature of Jehovah their God," i.e., they sought to conceal the true nature of Jehovah by arbitrary perversions of the word of God. This is the explanation correctly given by Hengstenberg (Dissert. vol. i. p. 210, transl.); whereas the interpretation proposed by Thenius, "they trifled with things which were not right against Jehovah," is as much at variance with the usage of the language as that of Gesenius (thes. p. 5050, perfide egerunt res ... in Jehovam, since &#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500; simply means to cover over a thing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>). This covering of words over Jehovah showed itself in the fact that they built &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (altars on high places), and by worshipping God in ways of their own invention concealed the nature of the revealed God, and made Jehovah like the idols.

Such bamoth were the houses of high places and altars built for the golden calves at Bethel and Dan, beside which no others are mentioned by name in the history of the kingdom of the ten tribes, which restricts itself to the principal facts, although there certainly must have been others.</body></html>
