No annals of his reign have come down to us in the cuneiform inscriptions, but a fragment of the Eponyra-list notes foreign expeditions for the three successive years 725-723 B.C. This agrees with what Menander states (Josephus, <span class= "ital">Ant. ix.</span> 14, 2), according to whom Shalmaneser made an expedition against Tyre (and no doubt Israel, as the ally of Tyre), which lasted <span class= "ital">five</span> years—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> was continued beyond Shalmaneser’s reign into that of Sargon.

The archives of Tyre mention him as contemporary with, and warring against, a Tyrian king named Elulaeus. The expedition, referred to here, was probably in the first year of Shalmaneser (727 B.C.). Its main object was the reduction of Phoenicia, which had re-asserted its independence, but (except Tyre) was once more completely reduced. Shalmaneser probably passed on from Phoenicia into Galilee, where he attacked and took Beth-arbel (Arbela of Josephus, now Irbid), treating it with great severity <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>, in order to alarm Hoshea, who immediately submitted, and became tributary (see the marginal rendering and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a> note).

It is uncertain whether he was Tiglath-pileser's son or a usurper. The name, Shalmaneser (<span class="accented">Sali-manu-uzur</span>) was an old royal name in Assyria, and signified "Shalman protects" (compare the names Nabu-kudur-uzur, Nergal-asar-uzur, Nabu-pal-uzur, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And Hoshea became his servant.</span> Hoshea had been placed on the throne by Tiglath-pileser ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 123, 124, lines 17,18), and had paid him tribute (ibid., lines 18, 19). We must suppose that on Tiglath-pileser's death, in  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, he had revolted, and resumed his independence. Shalmaneser. having become king, probably came up against Hoshea in the same year, and forced him to resume his position of <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> tributary. This may have been the time when "<span class="accented">Shalman</span> spoiled Beth-Arbel in the day of battle" (Dos. 10:14), defeating Hoshea near that place (Arbela, now <span class="accented">Irbid</span>, in Galilee), and taking it. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him presents</span>; or, <span class="accented">rendered him tribute</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the margin of the Authorized Version. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ahaz also laid his hand upon the other costly vessels of the court of the temple. He broke off the panels of the Solomonian stands, which were ornamented with artistic carving, and removed the basins from the stands, and took the brazen sea from the brazen oxen upon which they stood, and placed it upon a stone pavement. The &#1493; before &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512; can only have crept into the text through a copyist's error, and the singular must be taken distributively: he removed from them (the stands) every single basin. &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1512;&#1510;&#1508;&#1514; (without the article) is not the stone pavement of the court of the temple, but a pedestal made of stones (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, lxx) for the brazen sea. The reason why, or the object with which Ahaz mutilated these sacred vessels, is not given. The opinion expressed by Ewald, Thenius, and others, that Ahaz made a present to Tiglath-pileser with the artistically wrought panels of the stands, the basins, and the oxen of the brazen sea, is not only improbable in itself, since you would naturally suppose that if Ahaz had wished to make a "valuable and very welcome present" to the Assyrian king, he would have chosen some perfect stands with their basins for this purpose, and not merely the panels and basins; but it has not the smallest support in the biblical text, - on the contrary, it has the context against it. For, in the first place, if the objects named had been sent to Tiglath-pileser, this would certainly have been mentioned, as well as the sending of the temple and palace treasures. And, again, the mutilation of these vessels is placed between the erection of the new altar which was constructed after the Damascene model, and other measures which Ahaz adopted as a protection against the king of Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-18.htm">2 Kings 16:18</a>). Now if Ahaz, on his return from visiting Tiglath-pileser at Damascus, had thought it necessary to send another valuable present to that king in order to secure his permanent friendship, he would hardly have adopted the measures described in the next verse.</body></html>
