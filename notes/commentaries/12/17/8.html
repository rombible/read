It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Idolatry was worse in the Israelites than in other nations, since it argued not merely folly and a gross carnal spirit, but also black ingratitude <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-3</a>.

No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the statutes of the heathen, </span> i.e. according to the laws and customs of the heathen, in the worship of their Baals, and other of their sins.

The Israelites had been repeatedly warned not to follow these (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-3.htm">Leviticus 18:3, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-14</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Whom the Lord east out from before the children of Israel</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Canaanitish nations, whose idolatries and other "<span class="accented">abominations"</span> were particularly hateful to God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-18.htm">Deuteronomy 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>, etc.) - <span class="cmt_word">and of the kings of Israel.</span> The sins and idolatries of Israel had a double origin. The great majority were derived from the heathen nations with whom they were brought into contact, and were adopted voluntarily by the people themselves. Of this kind were the worship at "<span class="accented">high</span> places" (ver. 9), the "<span class="accented">images"</span> and "groves" (ver. 10), the causing of their children to "pass through the fire" (ver. 17), the employment of divination and enchantments (ver. 17), and perhaps the "<span class="accented">worship</span> of the host of heaven" (ver. 16). A certain number, however, came in from a different source, being imposed upon the people by their kings. To this class belong the desertion of the temple-worship, enforced by Jeroboam (vex. 21), the setting up of the calves at Dan and Bethel (ver. 16) by the same, and the Baal and <span class="accented">Astarte</span> worship (ver. 16), introduced by Ahab. This last and worst idolatry was not established without a good deal of persecution, as we learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Which they had made.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Hoshea King of Israel. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-1.htm">2 Kings 17:1</a>. In the twelfth year of Ahaz began Hoshea to reign. As Hoshea conspired against Pekah, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, in the fourth year of Ahaz, and after murdering him made himself king, whereas according to the verse before us it was not till the twelfth year of Ahaz that he really became king, his possession of the throne must have been contested for eight years. The earlier commentators and almost all the chronologists have therefore justly assumed that there was en eight years' anarchy between the death of Pekah and the commencement of Hoshea's reign. This assumption merits the preference above all the attempts made to remove the discrepancy by alterations of the text, since there is nothing at all surprising in the existence of anarchy at a time when the kingdom was in a state of the greatest inward disturbance and decay. Hoshea reigned nine years, and "did that which was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, though not like the kings of Israel before him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-2.htm">2 Kings 17:2</a>). We are not told in what Hoshea was better than his predecessors, nor can it be determined with any certainty, although the assumption that he allowed his subjects to visit the temple at Jerusalem is a very probable one, inasmuch as, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-10.htm">2 Chronicles 30:10</a>., Hezekiah invited to the feast of the Passover, held at Jerusalem, the Israelites from Ephraim and Manasseh as far as to Zebulun, and some individuals from these tribes accepted his invitation. But although Hoshea was better than his predecessors, the judgment of destruction burst upon the sinful kingdom and people in his reign, because he had not truly turned to the Lord; a fact which has been frequently repeated in the history of the world, namely, that the last rulers of a decaying kingdom have not been so bad as their forefathers. "God is accustomed to defer the punishment of the elders in the greatness of His long-suffering, to see whether their descendants will come to repentance; but if this be not the case, although they may not be so bad, the anger of God proceeds at length to visit iniquity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>)."
