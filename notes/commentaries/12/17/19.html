And though his son Hezekiah made a noble reformation, it lasted no longer than his time, so extremely corrupted was the nation. Judah’s idolatry and wickedness are here remembered as an aggravation of the sin of the Israelites, which was not only evil in itself, but mischievous to their neighbours, who by their examples were instructed in their wicked arts, and provoked to an imitation of them: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-7.htm" title="Woe to the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!">Matthew 18:7</a>.

It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This verse and the next are parenthetical.

For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned&#8212;There is here given a very full and impressive vindication of the divine procedure in punishing His highly privileged, but rebellious and apostate, people. No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Judah’s idolatry and wickedness is here remembered, as an aggravation of the sin of the Israelites, which was not only evil in itself but scandalous and mischievous to their neighbour, who by heir examples were instructed in their wicked arts, and provoked to an imitation of them: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a></span>, and compare <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-7.htm" title="Woe to the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!">Matthew 18:7</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God,....

This was specially the case when the son of Jehoshaphat intermarried with a daughter of Ahab, and so brought in Baal-worship and its attendant abominations. The calf-worship however seems never to have come across the border, but to have remained in Israel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God.</span> The sharp contrast which the writer has drawn between Israel and Judah in ver. 18 reminds him that the difference was only for a time.

Judah is mentioned as well as Israel, although the historian is simply describing the causes of Israel's rejection to indicate beforehand that Judah was already preparing the same fate for itself, as is still more plainly expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-19.htm">2 Kings 17:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20</a>; not, as Thenius supposes, because he is speaking here of that which took place before the division of the kingdom.
