The use of different waters is said to have good and bad effects upon the functions of conception and parturition (not “a popular superstition,” as Reuss suggests). “The ground is barren,” or unfruitful, is therefore an incorrect translation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm" title="And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.">2 Kings 2:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">The water is naught, and the ground barren — </span>Either it was so originally, at least as to that part of the city where the college of the prophets was; or it became so from the curse of God inflicted upon it, either when Joshua first took the city, or when Hiel rebuilt it: however, upon the prophet’s care it became exceeding fruitful, and therefore is commended for its fertility by later writers.

Prophets should make every place to which they come better for them, endeavouring to sweeten bitter spirits, and to make barren souls fruitful, by the word of God, which is like the salt cast into the water by Elisha. It was an apt emblem of the effect produced by the grace of God on the sinful heart of man. Whole families, towns, and cities, sometimes have a new appearance through the preaching of the gospel; wickedness and evil have been changed into fruitfulness in the works of righteousness, which are, through Christ, to the praise and glory of God. Here is a curse on the youths of Bethel, enough to destroy them; it was not a curse causeless, for it was Elisha's character, as God's prophet, that they abused. They bade him go up, reflecting on the taking up of Elijah into heaven. The prophet acted by Divine impulse. If the Holy Spirit had not directed Elisha's solemn curse, the providence of God would not have followed it with judgment. The Lord must be glorified as a righteous God who hates sin, and will reckon for it. Let young persons be afraid of speaking wicked words, for God notices what they say. Let them not mock at any for defects in mind or body; especially it is at their peril, if they scoff at any for well doing. Let parents that would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their hearts. And what will be the anguish of those parents, at the day of judgment, who witness the everlasting condemnation of their offspring, occasioned by their own bad example, carelessness, or wicked teaching!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The water is naught - i. e.

The inhabitants of Jericho, perceiving him to be a prophet, and endowed with a power of working miracles: <p>behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth; in a plain, surrounded with gardens and orchards, with vineyards, oliveyards, and groves of palm trees, and other odoriferous ones: <p>but the water is naught, and the ground barren; that is, that part of it where this water was, or ran, for from thence it became barren; or "caused to miscarry", as the word signifies (q); not only trees cast their fruit, which it watered, but women became abortive that drank of it, as Josephus says (r), and so cattle. Abarbinel thinks it was so from the times of Joshua, being cursed by him; but, if so, it would not have been inhabited again; rather this was owing to a new curse, upon its being rebuilt; though this might affect only a small part of the ground, not the whole, as before observed. <p>(q) "orbans", Montanus, Vatablus; "facit abortum", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

From the sons of the prophets they would gather that Elisha was now gifted with the spirit and power of Elijah. The situation of Jericho, near the passage of the Jordan, was such as to attract a considerable population after it was rebuilt, and for the sake of the prosperity which came to them in other ways they were content to dwell in such an unwholesome place. Now however they saw a hope of benefit and with this thought they came to Elisha. ‘It is good making use of a prophet while we have him’ (Bp Hall).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">we</span>] <span class="ital">pray thee</span>] The Hebrew is a mere interjection. The change in the English is justified because the petitioners were numerous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the situation of</span> this <span class="ital">city</span> is <span class="ital">pleasant</span>] Jericho was a part of that country which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm" title="And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.">Genesis 13:10</a>, is compared to ‘the garden of the Lord’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the water</span> is <span class="ital">naught</span>] This word is of frequent occurrence in the English of the 16th century in the sense of ‘bad’. So too ‘naughty’. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm" title="One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.">Jeremiah 24:2</a>, ‘naughty figs’. And for ‘naught’ cf. Shakes. <span class="ital">As You Like It</span>, I. 2. 68, ‘The mustard was <span class="ital">naught</span>’. <span class="ital">Much Ado</span>, v. I. 157, ‘If I do not carve most curiously, say my knife’s <span class="ital">naught</span>’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the ground barren</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">and the land miscarrieth</span>. The R.V. is explained in a margin ‘casteth her fruit’. The evil effect was clearly in consequence of the hurtful water, for the healing of the spring is to bring a remedy for the other evils. It seems therefore that the water was such as caused the trees to shed their fruit prematurely and the cattle which fed on the herbage which it watered to cast their young untimely, and it may be that the mischief extended also to the human beings who drank thereof.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-25.</span> - The historian passes to the record of some of Elisha's minor miracles, belonging to the time whereof he is writing, and helping to explain the position of dignity and respect which he is found to occupy in the next chapter (vers. 11-14). The miracles showed his twofold power, both to confer benefits and to punish. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the men of the city</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the inhabitants of Jericho; probably the civic authorities, having heard of the recent miracle - <span class="cmt_word">said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth.</span> According to the unanimous voice of travelers, the situation of Jericho (now <span class="accented">Eriha</span>) is charming. Lying on a broad plain which is traversed by an abundant river, at the point where one of the main wadys debouched from the Judaean upland upon the low country, shaded by groves of palm trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>) and fig-mulberries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-4.htm">Luke 19:4</a>), the air scented with aromatic shrubs, opobalsam, myroba-lanum, and the like, facing the Orient sun, and commanding a wide prospect both across and also up and down the Ghor, with the mountains of Moab in the distance, Jericho was, no doubt, even before the miracle of Elisha, a "pleasant" place. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - there was one drawback - <span class="cmt_word">the water is naught, and the ground barren.</span> Bitter and brackish springs, of which there are many in the Jordan valley, gushed forth from the foot of the mountains, and formed rivulets, which ran across the plain towards the Jordan, not diffusing health and fertility, but rather disease and barrenness. Untimely births, abortions, and the like prevailed among the cattle which were fed in the neighborhood, perhaps even among the inhabitants of the locality, and were attributed to the bitter springs, which made the land "miscarrying" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.). It was the prayer of the men of Jericho that Elisha would remove this inconvenience. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He then took up Elijah's prophet's mantle, which had fallen from him when he was snatched away, and returned to the Jordan. The prophet's mantle of the master fell to Elisha the disciple, as a pledge to himself that his request was fulfilled, and as a visible sign to others that he was his divinely appointed successor, and that the spirit of Elijah rested upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-15.htm">2 Kings 2:15</a>). </body></html>
