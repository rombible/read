For a fountain quickly works out any thing cast into it. But Elisha only used it as a sign of God’s power, which was to produce the effect, and to render the operation of that power more conspicuous. Therefore he says, <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord God, I have healed these waters — </span>He himself; the new cruise and the salt were no more than mere instruments, or channels through which God was pleased to convey this healing virtue. <span class="ital">There shall not be from thence any more death — </span>Hurt or danger, to man or beast, by drinking the water. <span class="ital">So the waters were healed unto this day — </span>There is a fountain at this very day, toward the west of Jericho, which rises about three quarters of a league above the town in the way to Jerusalem, and, yielding a great deal of water, very excellent in its kind, runs along and fructifies the plain: and many authors speak of the extraordinary fruitfulness and pleasantness of the country hereabouts, after this time.

Prophets should make every place to which they come better for them, endeavouring to sweeten bitter spirits, and to make barren souls fruitful, by the word of God, which is like the salt cast into the water by Elisha. It was an apt emblem of the effect produced by the grace of God on the sinful heart of man. Whole families, towns, and cities, sometimes have a new appearance through the preaching of the gospel; wickedness and evil have been changed into fruitfulness in the works of righteousness, which are, through Christ, to the praise and glory of God. Here is a curse on the youths of Bethel, enough to destroy them; it was not a curse causeless, for it was Elisha's character, as God's prophet, that they abused. They bade him go up, reflecting on the taking up of Elijah into heaven. The prophet acted by Divine impulse. If the Holy Spirit had not directed Elisha's solemn curse, the providence of God would not have followed it with judgment. The Lord must be glorified as a righteous God who hates sin, and will reckon for it. Let young persons be afraid of speaking wicked words, for God notices what they say. Let them not mock at any for defects in mind or body; especially it is at their peril, if they scoff at any for well doing. Let parents that would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their hearts. And what will be the anguish of those parents, at the day of judgment, who witness the everlasting condemnation of their offspring, occasioned by their own bad example, carelessness, or wicked teaching!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The spring of the waters - The spring intended is probably that now called Ain-es-Sultan, which is not much more than a mile from the site of the ancient town.

The modern town lies at a distance of two miles from it. Ain-es-Sultan is described as "a large and beautiful fountain of sweet and pleasant water" (Robinson, 'Researches,' vol. 2. p. 384), and as "scattering, even at the hottest season, the richest and most grateful vegetation over what would otherwise be a bare tract of sandy soft." The other springs of the neighborhood are mostly brackish. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the waters - <span class="cmt_word">any more death or barren land</span>; rather, or <span class="accented">miscarrying</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Return of Elisha to Jericho and Bethel, and his First Miracles. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-14.htm">2 Kings 2:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-15.htm">2 Kings 2:15</a>. Having returned to the banks of the Jordan, Elisha smote the water with Elijah's mantle, saying, "Where is Jehovah the God of Elijah, yea He?" and the water divided hither and thither, so that he was able to go through. &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, which the lxx did not understand, and have simply reproduced in Greek characters, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;, is an emphatic apposition, "yea He," such as we find after suffixes, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19</a>; and &#1488;&#1507; is only a strengthened &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, which is more usual when emphatic prominence is given to the suffix (vid., Ges. 121, 3). The Masoretic accentuation, which separates it from the preceding words, rests upon a false interpretation. There is no need either for the alteration proposed by Ewald, 362, a., of &#1488;&#1507; into &#1488;&#1498;, "he had scarcely smitten the water," especially as not a single analogous example can be adduced of the use of &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1488;&#1498; followed by a Vav consec.; or for the conjecture that the original reading in the text was &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488; (Houb., Bttch., Then.), "where is now the God of Elijah?" which derives no critical support from the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769; of the lxx, and is quite at variance with Hebrew usage, since &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488; generally stands immediately after &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, when it serves to strengthen the interrogation (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-38.htm">Judges 9:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>). This miracle was intended partly to confirm Elisha's conviction that his petition had been fulfilled, and partly to accredit him in the eyes of the disciples of the prophets and the people generally as the divinely appointed successor of Elijah. All the disciples of the prophets from Jericho saw also from this that the spirit of Elijah rested upon Elisha, and came to meet him to do homage to him as being now their spiritual father and lord. </body></html>
