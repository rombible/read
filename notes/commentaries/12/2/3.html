(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm" title="Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head, and restore you to your place: and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his butler.">Genesis 40:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-2.htm" title="And David said to Achish, Surely you shall know what your servant can do.

Others explain “from over thy head,” i.e., from his position of superiority over thee as thy master and teacher. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-21.htm" title="And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat.

The Hebrew term, <span class= "ital">hehĕshû</span>, imitates the sound, like our “hush!”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm" title="And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day?

Even in Beth-el, the chief place of idolatry and impiety, where one of the golden calves was worshipped, these schools were not wanting. This was a great testimony of God’s love to that apostate people: among whom he thus left prophets to recover them from their idols. And, what is still more remarkable, prophets of greater eminence for their miracles were continued in Israel than in Judah, because they needed them more, both to turn the idolaters among them from their false worship, and their other vices, and to encourage the truly pious that still remained, and preserve them from being led away by the error of the wicked. <span class="ital">Knowest thou not, </span>&c.? — God had revealed to some of them, that Elijah was to be taken away that day, of which they advised Elisha, that he might more diligently attend him. <span class="ital">From thy head — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">from above thy head; </span>which phrase may respect the manner of sitting in their schools, for the scholars used to sit below at their masters’ feet, and the masters above, over their heads, when they taught them. Houbigant renders it, <span class="ital">The Lord will elevate thy master above thy head to-day, </span>alluding to his being carried up into heaven. <span class="ital">And he said, Yea, I know it, hold ye your peace — </span>Do not aggravate my grief, nor divert me by any unseasonable discourses. He speaks as one who was himself, and would have them to be calm and sedate, and with awful silence waiting the event. Some think he gave them this charge, lest, the extraordinary matter being divulged, there should be a great concourse of people collected about Elijah; for as the Israelites had not renounced their idolatries, notwithstanding that so many and so great miracles had been done among them, they were altogether unworthy of being witnesses of the prophet’s miraculous assumption, even as the Jews in our Lord’s time were of being permitted to be present when he ascended.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 The Lord had let Elijah know that his time was at hand. He therefore went to the different schools of the prophets to give them his last exhortations and blessing. The removal of Elijah was a type and figure of the ascension of Christ, and the opening of the kingdom of heaven to all believers. Elisha had long followed Elijah, and he would not leave him now when he hoped for the parting blessing. Let not those who follow Christ come short by tiring at last. The waters of Jordan, of old, yielded to the ark; now, to the prophet's mantle, as a token of God's presence. When God will take up his faithful ones to heaven, death is the Jordan which they must pass through, and they find a way through it. The death of Christ has divided those waters, that the ransomed of the Lord may pass over.

Or the disciples of them, as the Targum; here, though a place where one of Jeroboam's calves was set up, was a school of the prophets, perhaps founded by Elijah as a nursery for religion, and a check upon the idolatry of the times: <p>came forth to Elisha; out of their college: and said unto him, knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today? who was, as Abarbinel observes, the crown and glory of his head; or else this is said, as generally thought, in allusion to disciples sitting at the feet of their masters, and so they at the head of them; the rapture of Elijah was by a spirit of prophecy revealed unto them: <p>and he said, yea, I know it; being revealed to him in the same way: <p>hold your peace: not caring to continue any discourse with them on the subject, that his thoughts, which were intent upon it, might not be interrupted, and that his master might not know that he knew of it, and lest he should be snatched away from him, and he not see him, while discoursing with them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> sons of the prophets that <i>were</i> at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> thy head to day?

See below verse 12. Whether the prophetic body in Gilgal had been warned before Elijah’s departure from them that they would see him no more wé are not told; but it seems highly probable that it was so from what is said of Bethel and of Jericho. Thus Elisha started on his journey prepared for what its end would be.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Beth-el</span>] This was the city which in old time had been called Luz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm" title="And the border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that lies on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.">Joshua 18:13</a>) though from one passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-2.htm" title="And goes out from Bethel to Luz, and passes along to the borders of Archi to Ataroth,">Joshua 16:2</a>) there seems to have been a distinction between Bethel and Luz, as though the latter had been the old town, and the former a sacred spot near to it. It lay in the northern part of the tribe of Benjamin, and when the kingdoms were divided and Jeroboam set up the calf-worship in Israel, Bethel was constituted the southern sanctuary. Perhaps it was as a protest against this worship that the sons of the prophets made one of their centres in Bethel. It was at Bethel that the voice of God’s prophet was first raised against Jeroboam’s altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1 Kings 13:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">came forth to Elisha</span>] The solemn event of which they had been forewarned checks them from addressing Elijah. His thoughts must have been all absorbed in meditation on the revelation which he was so soon to experience, and heaven, not earth, nor the things of earth, was in his mind. Silence when God is so near is the only homage man can pay.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day</span>] We can see from this language that the communion between Elijah and Elisha had been much closer than that which the aged prophet had held with the other sons of the prophets. Hence he is rather spoken of as Elisha’s master, than theirs. This is what we should expect from the special way in which Elisha was appointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1 Kings 19:16</a>). The prophetic bodies were therefore prepared to accept Elisha as their head, when Elijah had been taken away.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hold you your peace</span>] Elisha had marked the solemn and meditative frame of his master’s mind, and would not have it disturbed by any prolonged conversation between himself and the sons of the prophets. He cannot bear the questioning. He thinks of his own weakness and of the terrible burden which will be laid upon him when he is left alone without the friend on whom he has hitherto leaned.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of the prophets that were at Bethel</span> (On the expression, "sons of the prophets," see the comment upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>.) The institution of the "schools of the prophets," or theological colleges where young prophets were brought up, is usually assigned to Samuel, one of whose habitual residences for a part of the year was Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). Probably he had established a "school" there which continued to this time. <span class="cmt_word">Came forth to Elisha, and said unto him</span>. The students did not venture to address the master himself, who was a person of too much dignity to be intruded on; but sought out the servant, to give him a warning of what their prophetic instinct assured them was about to happen. <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from his position as teacher and master) today? There was, perhaps, something a little officious and self-assertive in this question.

Hence he answers them with something of rebuke: <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Yea, I know it</span> - literally, <span class="accented">I too know it</span> - <span class="cmt_word">hold ye your peace</span>; or, "Hush - do not chatter about what is so sacred; do not suppose that you are wiser than any one else; be a little modest and a little reticent." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then Elijah followed him to the king (&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, before him, i.e., before the king, not before the captain; and &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; for ??????, see Ewald, &#1431;264, b.), having been directed to do so by the angel of the Lord, and repeated to him the word of the Lord, which he had also conveyed to him through his messengers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-4.htm">2 Kings 1:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-6.htm">2 Kings 1:6</a>). </body></html>
