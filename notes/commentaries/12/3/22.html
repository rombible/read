A kingdom may be upheld and prosper, in consequence of the fervent prayers of those who are dear to God. May we place our highest regard upon such as are most precious in his account. When sinners are saying Peace, peace, destruction comes upon them: despair will follow their mad presumption. In Satan's service and at his suggestion, such horrid deeds have been done, as cause the natural feelings of the heart to shudder; like the king of Moab's sacrificing his son.

The divine interposition was shown by introducing the laws of nature to the determined end in the predetermined way [Keil]. It brought not only aid to the Israelitish army in their distress, by a plentiful supply of water, but destruction on the Moabites, who, perceiving the water, under the refulgent rays of the morning sun, red like blood, concluded the confederate kings had quarrelled and deluged the field with their mutual slaughter; so that, rushing to their camp in full expectation of great spoil, they were met by the Israelites, who, prepared for battle, fought and pursued them. Their country was laid waste in the way, which has always been considered the greatest desolation in the East (2Ki 3:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Because of the morning sun, which meeting with the vapours that arose from the earth, and shining through them upon the water, gave it a reddish tincture. God also so ordered things, that their senses and fancies were disturbed, or the air so disposed, that it might seem of this colour.

A ruddy sunrise is common in the East, more especially in stormy weather (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-3.htm">Matthew 16:3</a>); and the red light, falling upon the water in the pits, and reflected thence to the opposite side of the wady, would quite sufficiently account for the mistake of the Moabites, without supposing that the water was actually stained and discolored. The Moabites concluded that the red-looking liquid was blood, from knowing that the wady was dry the day before, and from not suspecting that there had been any change in the night, as the storm which had caused the change was at such a distance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He then sent for a minstrel, to collect his mind from the impressions of the outer world by the soft tones of the instrument, and by subduing the self-life and life in the external world to become absorbed in the intuition of divine things. On this influence of music upon the state of the mind, see the remark on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-16.htm">1 Samuel 16:16</a>, and Passavant's Untersuchungen ber den Lebens-magnetismus, p. 207 (ed. 2). - As the minstrel was playing, the hand of the Lord came upon him (&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; according to the later usage for &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>, etc.; compare Ewald, 345, b., and &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1497;&#1491; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>), so that he said in the name of the Lord: "Make this valley full of trenches (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, inf. abs. for the imperative; for &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; see Ges. 108, 4); for thus saith the Lord, ye will see neither wind nor rain, and this valley will be filled with water, that ye may be able to drink, and your flocks and your cattle." &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; are trenches for collecting water (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>), which would suddenly flow down through the brook-valley. This large quantity of water came on the (following) morning "by the way of Edom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-20.htm">2 Kings 3:20</a>), a heavy fall of rain or violent storm having taken place, as is evident from the context, in the eastern mountains of Edom, at a great distance from the Israelitish camp, the water of which filled the brook-valley, i.e., the Wady el Kurahy and el Ahsy (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a>) at once, without the Israelites observing anything either of the wind, which always precedes rain in the East (Harmar, Beobb. i. pp. 51, 52), or of the rain itself. &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; are the flocks intended for slaughtering, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; the beasts of burden.</body></html>
