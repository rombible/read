(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm" title="Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.">2Kings 1:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A sheep-master.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">nôqēd</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm" title="The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.">Amos 1:1</a>). In Arabic, <span class= "ital">naqad</span> means a kind of sheep of superior wool; <span class= "ital">naqqâd</span>, the owner or shepherd of such sheep. The land of Moab is mountainous, but well watered, and rich in fertile valleys, and thus specially suited for pasture; and the Arabian wilderness lay open to the Moabite shepherds and their flocks.<p><span class= "bld">Rendered.</span>—<span class= "ital">Used to render</span> (<span class= "ital">waw</span> conversive of the perfect); scil., year by year. This tribute is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm" title="Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.">Isaiah 16:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">With the wool.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">in wool</span> (an accusative of <span class= "ital">limitation</span>). The word rendered “lambs” (<span class= "ital">kārîm</span>) means lambs fatted for food. The expression “in wool,” therefore, relates only to the <span class= "ital">rams</span>. Mesha’s annual tribute was paid in kind, and consisted of a hundred thousand fatted lambs and the fleeces of a hundred thousand rams. This was a heavy burden for a country no larger than the county of Huntingdon. (Comp. Mesha’s own allusions to the “oppression” of Moab by Omri and Ahab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm" title="Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.">2Kings 1:1</a>, Note.) The LXX. adds, <span class= "greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἐπαναστάσει</span> (“in the revolt”); implying that the present rebellion was distinct from that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm" title="Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.">2Kings 1:1</a>, and that this tribute was imposed as an indemnity for the former revolt. The addition is probably due to a transcriber.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2 Kings 3:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Mesha, king of Moab, was a sheep-master — </span>The riches, not only of private men, but also of kings, in ancient times, consisted much in sheep and cattle.

Mesha resembled a modern Arab Sheikh, whose wealth is usually estimated by the number of his flocks and herds. His tribute of the wool of 100, 000 lambs was a tribute in kind, the ordinary tribute at this time in the East.<p>Mesha is the monarch who wrote the inscription on the "Moabite stone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a> note). The points established by the Inscription are:<p>1. That Moab recovered from the blow dealt by David <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>, and became again an independent state in the interval between David's conquest and the accession of Omri;<p>2. That Omri reconquered the country, and that it then became subject to the northern kingdom, and remained so throughout his reign and that of his son Ahab, and into the reign of Ahab's son and successor, Ahaziah;<p>3. That the independence was regained by means of a war, in which Mesha took town after town from the Israelites, including in his conquests many of the towns which, at the original occupation of the holy land, had passed into the possession of the Reubenites or the Gadites, as Baal-Meon <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>, Kirjathaim <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>, Ataroth <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>, Nebo <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>, Jahaz <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>, etc.;<p>4.

In that inscription the Moabite king mentions his successes against Omri and Omri’s successor and speaks of forty years as the time during which the conflict between Israel and Moab continued. Now Omri reigned six years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-23.htm" title="In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.">1 Kings 16:23</a>) and Ahab’s reign lasted twenty-two years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-29.htm" title="And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.">1 Kings 16:29</a>) while Ahaziah reigned one or two years more. Thus the whole period of forty years would not be covered unless we take in the reign of Jehoram. The Moabite inscription naturally represents only the Moabite successes, but the Scripture narrative shews that the victory over Omri had been followed by a defeat in the days of Ahab.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a sheepmaster</span>] The LXX. transliterates the word writing <span class="greekheb">Νωκήδ</span>. It occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm" title="The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.">Amos 1:1</a>. The other Greek versions and the Targum give the meaning. The Moabite country by its character, valleys with fertile hill-sides and streams of water running through them, was eminently suited for a pastoral people; and from the nature of the tribute imposed it seems likely that all the wealth of the Moabites was in their cattle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">rendered unto the king of Israel</span>] At the division of the kingdoms, Moab would fall to the share of the ten tribes, as it joined on to the south of the tribe of Reuben. Perhaps the tribute at first had not been so heavy as is here described, but had been increased on account of the struggles of Moab to throw off their yoke.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams</span>, with <span class="ital">the wool</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the wool of</span> <span class="ital">an hundred thousand lambs, and of an hundred thousand rams</span>. There is nothing in the Hebrew for ‘with’. The construction is: ‘he rendered these animals, the wool’. So that it seems best to take the last word as explanatory of what has preceded, and to understand that what the Moabite king gave of these numerous animals was the fleece only. The LXX. understood it so, and gives <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πόκων</span>, as we might say <span class="ital">fleece-wise</span>. That version however adds in the verse, without any warrant of the original, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἐπαναστάσει</span> = <span class="ital">in the revolt</span>, as if to explain that this large payment had been made only on one occasion. But this is wholly without evidence, and the Hebrew would lead us to think that the payment was made every year, and this is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm" title="Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.">Isaiah 16:1</a>, ‘Send ye the lamb’, i.e. the tribute of lambs. This being so, it is more likely that the fleeces were sent than the live stock. Indeed there would be little meaning in adding ‘the wool’ if the flocks were to be sent alive. It should be mentioned however that Josephus supports the A.V. saying <span class="greekheb">μνριάδας εἴκοσι προβάτων σὺν τοῖς πόκοις</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-27.</span> - THE WAR WITH MOAB. The historian goes back to the origin of the war. He had already, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>, mentioned the revolt of Moab at the death of Ahab; but he now recalls his readers' attention to the fact, and to some extent explains it and accounts for it. Moab had been treated oppressively - had been forced to pay an extraordinarily heavy tribute - and was in a certain sense driven into rebellion (vers. 4, 5). Jehoram, when he came to the kingdom, determined to make a great effort to put the rebellion down, and to re-establish the authority of Israel over the revolted people His relations with Jehoshaphat of Israel were so close that he had no difficulty in persuading him to join in the war. He was also able to obtain the alliance of the King of Edom. Thus strengthened, he made no doubt of being successful, and confidently invaded the country (vers. 6-9). The course of the war is then related (vers. 10-27). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judgment of God upon the loose fellows at Bethel.
