He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jehoram's humility in seeking <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-12.htm">2 Kings 3:12</a> instead of summoning Elisha, does not save him from rebuke.

What have I to do with thee? &c.&#8212;Wishing to produce a deep spirit of humility and contrition, Elisha gave a stern repulse to the king of Israel, accompanied by a sarcastic sneer, in bidding him go and consult Baal and his soothsayers. But the distressed condition, especially the imploring language, of the royal suppliants, who acknowledged the hand of the Lord in this distress, drew from the prophet the solemn assurance, that solely out of respect to Jehoshaphat, the Lord's true servant, did he take any interest in Jehoram.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, </span> whom I reverence and love for his virtue and piety. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Elisha said, as the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand,....

As <span class="ital">the Lord of hosts liveth</span>] Probably the use of this expression is due to the circumstances. Jehovah, set before the Jews as the Lord of the armies both of heaven and of earth, would be fitly spoken of by this title at this time. There were three armies together all reduced to the greatest straits, and brought to sue for help to the prophet of the Lord. It was a fit opportunity for pointing out that though armies may be gathered, yet the issue of their undertaking is in His hands alone. He is the living God, all others are no gods.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat</span>] Thus the prophet continues the same thought. Jehovah, the Lord of hosts, is specially the protector of His people. When they are in danger, and cry to Him, He heareth them. And the prophet is the representative of God. Jehoshaphat joins in the appeal, and for his sake mercy is extended to the less deserving also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I would not look toward thee, nor see thee</span>] There is no sense employed with less labour to the possessor than that of sight. Hence the expression here used implies that Elisha would not have made the faintest effort for Jehoram’s sake alone.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</span> Jehoshaphat's conduct had not been blameless; he had twice incurred the rebuke of a prophet for departures from the line of strict duty - once for "helping the ungodly" Ahab at Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>); and a second time for "joining himself with Ahaziah to make ships to go to Ophir" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). Even now he was engaged in an expedition which had received no Divine sanction, and was allied with two idolatrous monarchs. But Elisha condones these derelictions of duty in consideration of the king's honesty of purpose and steady attachment to Jehovah, which is witnessed to by the authors both of Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>) and Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-5.htm">2 Chronicles 20:5-21</a>, etc.). He "regards the presence of Jehoshaphat," and therefore consents to return an answer to the three kings, and announce to them the mode of their deliverance. The adjuration wherewith he opens his speech is one of great solemnity, only used upon very special occasions (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>), and adds great force to his declaration. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In reply to Joram's question, "By which way shall we advance (against Moab)?" Jehoshaphat decided in favour of "the way through the desert of Edom." There were two ways by which it was possible to enter the land of the Moabites; namely, either by going above the Dead Sea, and crossing the Jordan and the boundary river Arnon, and so entering it from the north, or by going round the southern point of the Dead Sea, and advancing through the northern portion of the mountains of Edom, and thus entering it from the south. The latter way was the longer of the two, and the one attended with the greatest difficulties and dangers, because the army would have to cross mountains which were very difficult to ascend. Nevertheless Jehoshaphat decided in its favour, partly because, if they took the northern route, they would have the Syrians at Ramoth in Gilead to fear, partly also because the Moabites, from their very confidence in the inaccessibility of their southern boundary, would hardly expect any attack from that side, and might therefore, if assailed at that point, be taken off their guard and easily defeated, and probably also from a regard to the king of Edom, whom they could induce to join them with his troops if they took that route, not so much perhaps for the purpose of strengthening their own army as to make sure of his forces, namely, that he would not make a fresh attempt at rebellion by a second invasion of the kingdom of Judah while Jehoshaphat was taking the field against the Moabites.</body></html>
