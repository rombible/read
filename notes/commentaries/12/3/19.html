But these words are rather to be considered as a prediction of their success, than as a command, enjoining them to do all these things; and thus understood, they imply that their victory should be so full and complete, that they should have it in their power to lay the country of the Moabites waste with fire and sword.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:6-19 The king of Israel laments their distress, and the danger they were in. He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye shall fell every good tree - This is not an infringement of the rule laid down in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19-20</a>. The Israelites were not forbidden to fell the fruit trees in an enemy's country, as a part of the ravage of war, when they had no thoughts of occupying the country. The plan of thus injuring an enemy was probably in general use among the nations of these parts at the time. We see the destruction represented frequently on the Assyrian monuments and mentioned in the inscriptions of Egypt.<p>And stop all wells of water - The stoppage of wells was a common feature of ancient, and especially Oriental, warfare (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15-18</a>).<p>Mar ... with stones - The exact converse of that suggested in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>. The land in and about Palestine is so stony that the first work of the cultivator is to collect the surface stones together into heaps. An army marching through a land could easily undo this work, dispersing the stones thus gathered, and spreading them once more over the fields. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

And if this command seem severe, it must be considered that the Moabites were a very wicked people, perfidious, cruel, implacable enemies to God’s people upon all occasions, and now in a state of rebellion.

But in that place the reference is to the trees of Canaan, where the people were themselves to settle and live. The land of Moab was not to be occupied by them, therefore they were bidden to destroy everything in it. In Deuteronomy it is expressly said, ‘Thou shalt not destroy them, for thou mayest eat of them’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">stop all wells</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">fountains</span>] <span class="ital">of water</span>] As water in the east is mostly reached by digging, what is here meant is that all such places should be filled up, so that the work of obtaining water might have all to be done over again. The R.V. gives ‘fountains’ in verse 25 also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Mark every good piece of land</span>] The verb, when used elsewhere, signifies ‘to give, or have, pain’. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm" title="For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole.">Job 5:18</a>, ‘He maketh sore’. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-22.htm" title="Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:">Ezekiel 13:22</a>, ‘I have not made sad’. The LXX. translates here, ‘ye shall render useless’. The expression is somewhat poetical, representing the land as mourning because it is rendered unfruitful. But a similar figure, though not the same word, is found <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-4.htm" title="How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.">Jeremiah 12:4</a>, ‘How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither?’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city.</span> The LXX. omit the second clause, perhaps because they could not reproduce in Greek the assonance of the Hebrew, where the words for "fenced" and "choice" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>) have nearly the same sound. <span class="cmt_word">And shall fell every good tree.</span> It has been said that the Law forbade this, and argued <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Elisha did not here utter a command, but only a prediction (Pool), not bidding the Israelites to cut down the trees, but only telling them they would do so; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Elisha intentionally excepted the Moabites from the merciful provision of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19, 20</a>), having authority to do so, and regarding the Moabites as exceptionally wicked (Keil); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the Mosaic Law was not observed under the kings, and that Elisha himself had forgotten the provision about fruit trees (Geddes). But a careful examination of the passage in Deuteronomy will show <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that there is no general prohibition of the cutting down of fruit trees, but only a prohibition of their being cut down for <span class="accented">siege works</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the prohibition rests on prudential, not on moral, grounds, and is thus practically limited to cases where the conquest of the country attacked, and its occupation by the conquerors, are looked forward to. The words are, "When thou shalt besiege a city.... thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: <span class="accented">for thou mayest eat of them</span>." The destruction of the fruit trees in an enemy's country was a common feature of the wars of the period, and was largely practiced, both By the Assyrians and the Egyptians (see Layard's 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, p. 73; second series, pl. 40; 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 588; and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 5, 51, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And stop all wells of water.</span> The stoppage of springs and wells was another common practice in ancient times, often employed against enemies and aliens. The Philistines stopped the Hebrew wells in the days of Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>). Hezekiah stopped the springs of water outside Jerusalem, when he expected to be besieged By the Assyrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3, 4</a>). The Scythians, when Darius invaded their country, stopped all their own wells as they retired before him (Herod., 4:120). Arsaces III. partly stopped, and partly poi-ached, the Persian wells in his war with Antiochus the Great (Polyb., 10:28. &sect; 5). The practice was regarded as quite legitimate. <span class="cmt_word">And mar every good piece of land with stones</span>; literally, <span class="accented">grieve every good piece of land</span>. To clear the stones off a piece of ground was the first step towards preparing it for cultivation in the stony regions on either side of the Jordan. The clearance was generally effected by collecting the stones into heaps. When it was wished to "mar the land," the stones were there to be spread over it afresh. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In order still further to humble the king of Israel, who was already bowed down by the trouble, and to produce some salutary fruit of repentance in his heart, Elisha addressed him in these words: "What have I to do with thee? Go to the (Baal-) prophets of thy father and thy mother! Let them help thee." When Joram replied to this in a supplicatory tone: &#1506;&#1500;, no, pray (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-13.htm">Ruth 1:13</a>), i.e., speak not in this refusing way, for the Lord has brought these three kings - not me alone, but Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom also - into this trouble; Elisha said to him with a solemn oath (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>): "If I did not regard Jehoshaphat, I should not look at thee and have respect to thee," i.e., I should not deign to look at thee, much less to help thee.</body></html>
