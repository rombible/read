It was the great fortress of Moab, though not the capital, which was Rabbath or Rabbah. It was an important strong-hold at the time of the Crusades, and is still a place of great strength. Kir seems to have meant "fortress." It is found in Cir-cesium, Car-chemish, etc.<p>Kir-Haraseth resisted all the attempts to dismantle it; but the slingers found places on the hills which surrounded it, from where they could throw their stones into it and harass the garrison, though they could not take the town. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

It will be seen from the margin of A.V. that the R.V. approaches more nearly to the literal sense of the Hebrew. What is meant to be expressed is that the only town of which the stone walls were allowed to remain was this capital city of Moab. Probably it was the only city with any solidity of walls. A pastoral people, such as the Moabites were, have very little need for fenced towns. Kirhareseth (for so the name is pointed) is the same which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm" title="The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;">Isaiah 15:1</a> is called Kir of Moab, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-31.htm" title="Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; my heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.">Jeremiah 48:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm" title="Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he has gotten are perished.">Jeremiah 48:36</a> Kir-heres. As Kir signifies ‘wall’ or ‘fortress’, there appears much probability that this was the only very great stronghold in the land, though Ar of Moab is mentioned as a fortified town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm" title="The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;">Isaiah 15:1</a>). The other village-like settlements were easily dismantled, and their stones served to strew and ruin the pastures. All that was attempted on the stronger place was to clear its walls of their defenders by means of slingers.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they beat down the cities</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> destroyed them - leveled them with the ground - <span class="cmt_word">and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone</span> (see ver. 19 and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.), <span class="cmt_word">and filled it</span> [with stones]. <span class="cmt_word">And they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fruit trees, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> (Josephus) - <span class="cmt_word">only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof</span>; literally, <span class="accented">until in Kir-haraseth</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in Kir-haraseth only - left <span class="accented">he the stones thereof</span>. He (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the commander, or the army) went on destroying and leveling the cities, <span class="accented">until</span> he came to Kir-haraseth, which proved too strong for him. There he was obliged to leave the stones untouched. Kir-haraseth, which is not mentioned among the early Moabite towns, nor even upon the Moabite Stone, and which is therefore thought to have been a newly constructed fortress (Ewald), was, in the later times, one of the most important of the strongholds of Moab (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>). It was sometimes called Kir-Moab, "the fortress of Moab." At what time it got the name of Kerak is uncertain; but we find it spoken of as Kerak-Moab by Ptolemy (about A.D. ), and by Stephen of Byzantium (about A.D. ). It was a place of much importance in the time of the Crusades. The situation is one of great strength. The fortress is built upon the top of a steep hill, surrounded on all sides by a deep arid narrow valley, which again is completely enclosed by mountains, rising higher than the fort itself. It is undoubtedly one of the strongest positions within the territory anciently possessed by the Moabites. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</span> Ewald thinks that by "<span class="accented">slingers"</span> are meant, not mere ordinary slingers, but persons who worked more elaborate engines, as catapults and the like ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 89, note, Eng. trans.). He is undoubtedly correct in saying that "all sorts of elaborate modes of attacking fortifications were very early known in Asia;" but it is very questionable whether the Hebrew word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) can mean anything but "slingers" in the usual sense. The LXX. translate by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The situation is one which would allow of "slingers," in the ordinary sense, sending their missiles into the place, and grievously harassing it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elisha continued: "and this is too little for Jehovah (the comparative force of &#1504;&#1511;&#1500; is implied in the context, especially in the alternating combination of the two clauses, which is indicated by &#1493;...&#1493;, see Ewald, 360, c.): He will also give Moab into your hand, and ye will smite all the fortified and choice cities, fell all the good trees (fruit-trees), stop up all the springs of water, and spoil all the good fields with stones." &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512; and &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512; are intended to produce a play upon words, through the resemblance in their sound and meaning (Ewald, 160, c.). In the announcement of the devastation of the land there is an allusion to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19-20</a>, according to which the Israelites were ordered to spare the fruit-trees when Canaan was taken. These instructions were not to apply to Moab, because the Moabites themselves as the arch-foes of Israel would not act in any other way with the land of Israel if they should gain the victory. &#1492;&#1499;&#1488;&#1489;, to add pain, is a poetical expression for spoiling a field or rendering it infertile through the heaping up of stones.</body></html>
