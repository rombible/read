How unrighteous soever they were that did it, God was righteous who suffered it to be done. Now was a happy change from one of the worst, to one of the best of the kings of Judah. Once more Judah was tried with a reformation. Whether the Lord bears long with presumptuous offenders, or speedily cuts them off in their sins, all must perish who persist in refusing to walk in his ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was buried - The catacomb of David was probably full, and the later kings, from Ahaz downward, had to find sepulture elsewhere.

Manasseh and Amon were interred in "the garden of Uzza," a portion (apparently) of the royal palace-garden; perhaps so called after the name of the previous owner.

And on Amon, his son, the reformation of the father seems to have had no effect. ‘An ill guise is easily taken up, it is not so easily left.

Studien u. Krit. 1859, iii., has been met by E. Gerlach in the same magazine of 1861. For further remarks see the Commentary on the Chronicles.)</body></html>
