The words used represent the city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken, yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The general meaning is plain, but the exact force of the metaphor used is not so clear.

The Targum is, the line of destruction; and the sense is, that the same measure should be measured to Jerusalem as was to Samaria; that is, the same lot and portion should befall one as the other, that is, be utterly destroyed: <p>and the plummet of the house of Ahab; the Targum is, the weight or plummet of tribulation; signifying, that the same calamities should come upon the families of Jerusalem, and especially on the family of Manasseh as came upon the family of Ahab. It is a metaphor from builders that take down as well as raise up buildings by rule and measure, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>. <p>and I will wipe Jerusalem, as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down; as when one takes a dish or cup that has broth in it, or any liquid, as oil; and the Septuagint render it alabaster, in which ointment used to be put; and wipes it clean, that nothing may appear in it; and then turns it with its mouth downward, that, if any thing should remain, it might drain out; signifying hereby the emptying o Jerusalem of its palaces and houses, wealth and riches and of all its inhabitants; and yet the empty dish being preserved, seems to denote the restoration of Jerusalem after the seventy years' captivity. According to the Vulgate Latin version, the metaphor is taken from the blotting out of writing tables, and turning and rubbing the style upon them till the writing is no more seen. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as <i>a man</i> wipeth a dish, wiping <i>it</i>, and turning <i>it</i> upside down.</span><p>(d) As I have destroyed Samaria and the house of Ahab so will I destroy Judah.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab</span>] The figures are taken from the occupation of the builder. The builder employs line and plummet that he may carry out his work exactly according to the plan prescribed. But here the pattern is one of utter destruction, which God Himself threatens to carry out after the fashion of Samaria and the house of Ahab, which the previous generation had beheld utterly destroyed. Samaria and the house of Ahab were famous for building (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">1 Kings 22:39</a> note). Hence the peculiar fitness of the figure. These great builders, with all that they had built, were swept away and just so should it be with Jerusalem. The way in which a portion of the judgement was carried out is described by the Chronicler: ‘The Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh in chains (R.V.) and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as</span> a man <span class="ital">wipeth a dish</span>] The description is of a thing that is done with, and will be used no more. ‘To turn it upside down’, is literally ‘to turn it upon the face thereof’, a rendering which brings out very completely the intention of using the dish no more. Such God declares will be His manner of dealing with Jerusalem. The verb rendered ‘wipe’ is the same which is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-4.htm" title="For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.">Genesis 7:4</a>, ‘Every living substance … <span class="ital">will I destroy</span>’, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-23.htm" title="And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:">Numbers 5:23</a> ‘he shall <span class="ital">blot them out</span>’, and in the solemn sentence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-33.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.">Exodus 32:33</a>, ‘him will I <span class="ital">blot out</span> of my book’. The original very markedly shews that God’s <span class="ital">wiping</span> was to be <span class="ital">a wiping out</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will do to Jerusalem as I have done to Samaria; I will execute upon it a similar judgment." God applies his measuring-line, a perfectly uniform standard, to all nations, as to all individuals, and metes out to them an equal measure of justice. Jerusalem will be presently treated as Samaria has been recently treated; and a similar destruction will overtake it. The metaphor is not to be pressed, as if cities were destroyed with as much care as they are built, by constant use of the measuring-line and the plummet. <span class="cmt_word">And the plummet of the house of Ahab.</span> The justice meted out to the house of Ahab shall be meted out also to the house of David. The ways of God are equal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>), and he is no" respecter of persons." He has one law for all; and, as the house of David has sinned in the same way, and to the same extent, as the house of Ahab had sinned, one and the same punishment will fall upon both of them. <span class="cmt_word">And I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.</span> Jerusalem will be emptied, as a man empties his dish of the refuse scraps remaining on it, and will be then put away, as done with.

In the description of his idolatry, which advances gradatim, this is introduced as the very worst crime.
