Thenius argues that the garden of Uzza lay in the Tyropœon, at the foot of the spur of Ophel.

The words used represent the city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken, yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was buried - The catacomb of David was probably full, and the later kings, from Ahaz downward, had to find sepulture elsewhere. Ahaz was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the sepulchres of the kings <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-27.htm">2 Chronicles 28:27</a>. Hezekiah found a resting place on the way that led up to David's catacomb <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>. Manasseh and Amon were interred in "the garden of Uzza," a portion (apparently) of the royal palace-garden; perhaps so called after the name of the previous owner.

Manasseh seems to have made a new family tomb in a garden belonging to his house (see ver. 26; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>). It is quite impossible to fix its site. <span class="cmt_word">In the garden of Uzza.</span> Probably an addition to the old palace garden; perhaps a purchase made by Manasseh with the object of converting it into a burial-ground. "Uzza," or "Uzzah," was a common name among the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-49.htm">Ezra 2:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-51.htm">Nehemiah 7:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-7.htm">1 Chronicles 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-11</a>), and does not point to any definite individual. <span class="cmt_word">And Amen his son reigned in his stead.</span> "Amon" in Hebrew means "Nursling," or "Darling," and it is quite possible that Manasseh gave his son the name in this sense. But it is also the ordinary Hebrew form of the term ("Amen," or "Amun") by which the Egyptians designated the great god of Thebes, whom the Greeks and Romans called "Ammon." It has therefore been thought by many that it was given by Manasseh to his son "in an idolatrous spirit." So Bishop Cotton in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 61, and others. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord therefore announced through the prophets, to the rebellious and idolatrous nation, the destruction of Jerusalem and the deliverance of Judah into the hands of its enemies; but, as is added in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-10.htm">2 Chronicles 33:10</a>, they paid no heed to them. The prophets who foretold this terrible judgment are not named. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-18.htm">2 Chronicles 33:18</a>, their utterances were entered in the annals of the kings. Habakkuk was probably one of them, since he (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>) predicted the Chaldaean judgment as a fact which excited astonishment and appeared incredible. The Amorites are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-11.htm">2 Kings 21:11</a> instar omnium as the supporters of the Canaanitish ungodliness, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-26.htm">1 Kings 21:26</a>, etc. - The phrase, "that whosoever heareth it, both his ears may tingle," denotes such a judgment as has never been heard of before, and excites alarm and horror (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>).
