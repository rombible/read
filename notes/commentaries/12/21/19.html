How unrighteous soever they were that did it, God was righteous who suffered it to be done. Now was a happy change from one of the worst, to one of the best of the kings of Judah. Once more Judah was tried with a reformation. Whether the Lord bears long with presumptuous offenders, or speedily cuts them off in their sins, all must perish who persist in refusing to walk in his ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was buried - The catacomb of David was probably full, and the later kings, from Ahaz downward, had to find sepulture elsewhere.

The short reign of Amen, the son and successor of Manasseh, was distinguished by only two events: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> his restoration of all the idolatrous and wicked practices which his father had upheld during the earlier portion of his reign; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his untimely death, in consequence of a conspiracy which was formed against him among the officers of his court. The writer of Kings is therefore able to dispatch his history in eight verses. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign.</span> So Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:4. &sect; 1), and the author of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-21.htm">2 Chronicles 33:21</a>). He must have been born in  <span class="date">B.C. 664</span>, early in the reign of Asshur-bani-pal, probably in the year of that monarch's expedition against Tyro. And he reigned two years in Jerusalem. The "twelve years" assigned to Amen By the Duke of Manchester ('Times of Daniel') are wholly devoid of foundation, and would throw the entire chronology into confusion. As it is, there is a very exact accordance in this part of the history between the profane and the scriptural dates. <span class="cmt_word">And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</span> Jotbah is probably the same city as the "Jotbath" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-7.htm">Deuteronomy 10:7</a>, and the "Jotbathah" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-33.htm">Numbers 33:33</a>, which was in the neighborhood of Ezion-geber, and therefore probably in the Arabah. Josephus, however, says that Jot-bah was "a city of Judah." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I stretch over Jerusalem the measure of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab." The measure (&#1511;&#1493;) and the plummet (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;, lit., a level) were applied to what was being built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>), and also to what was being made level with the ground, i.e., completely thrown down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a>). From this sprang the figurative expressions, measure of desolation and plummet of devastation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>). - The measure of Samaria therefore denotes the measure which was applied to the destruction of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab denotes the extermination of the royal house of Ahab. The meaning is: I shall destroy Jerusalem as I have destroyed Samaria, and exterminate its inhabitants like the house of Ahab. In the second hemistich the same thing is expressed, if possible, still more strongly: "I wipe away Jerusalem as one wipes the dish, and (having) wiped (it), turns it upon its upper side (&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;)." The wiping of a dish that has been used, and the turning over of the dish wiped, so as not to leave a single drop in it, are a figurative representation of the complete destruction of Jerusalem and the utter extermination of its inhabitants.</body></html>
