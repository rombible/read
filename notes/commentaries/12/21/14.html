The words used represent the city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken, yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The general meaning is plain, but the exact force of the metaphor used is not so clear.

The ten tribes were forsaken when the Assyrians took and destroyed Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18, 23</a>); the two remained. Now the two also would be forsaken, and the last remnant of God's inheritance cast out. <span class="cmt_word">And deliver them into the hand of their enemies.</span> Not the Chaldeans only, who were not yet "their enemies," but their persistent and inveterate enemies, the Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>), and Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>), who all joined with Nebuchadnezzar at the last, and (as Ewald says, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p, 270) "indulged their ancient hatred by taking a very active part in the final war." <span class="cmt_word">And they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-27.htm">Jeremiah 48:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>, etc.). The years which immediately followed the Captivity were years of terrible suffering to the remnant whom Nebuchadnezzar left in the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>). Every petty power in the neighborhood felt itself at liberty to make incursions with Judaea at its pleasure, to plunder and ravage, and drive off cap-tires, or massacre them in cold blood, or commit, any other atrocity. Some critics regard the description of Isaiah in 2 Kings 42:22-24 as prophetic of these sufferings. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The word of the Lord, "I will no more make the foot of Israel to move out of the land which I gave to their fathers," refers to the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a> : "I will appoint my people a place, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be stirred up no more," which had been fulfilled by the building of the temple as the seat of the name of the Lord, in the manner indicated in pp. 85ff. The lasting fulfilment of this promise, however, was made to rest upon the condition of Israel's faithful adherence to the commandments of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6</a>.).</body></html>
