But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations.

A great influx of these impostors had, at various times, poured from Chaldea into the land of Israel to pursue their gainful occupations, especially during the reigns of the latter kings; and Manasseh was not only their liberal patron, but zealous to appear himself an adept in the arts. He raised them to be an influential class at his court, as they were in that of Assyria and Babylon, where nothing was done till they had ascertained the lucky hour and were promised a happy issue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Made his son pass through the fire; </span> of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2 Kings 16:3</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Observed times</span>, i.e. lucky or unlucky days or seasons for the despatch of businesses, according to the superstitious practice of the heathens.

Probably the expression in Chronicles only means that he practised this Moloch-worship, and the plural number need not be literally pressed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pass through the fire</span>] See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2 Kings 16:3</a>. ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’ mentioned by the Chronicler was a ravine on the south and west of Jerusalem, the south-east extremity of which had the name of <span class="ital">Tophet</span>. Because of the horrors which had been perpetrated there, the place was defiled, and converted into a receptacle of all that was foul and offensive, for the destruction of which constant fires were kept burning. For this reason the name <span class="ital">Ge Hinnom</span>, modified into <span class="ital">Gehenna</span>, came to be employed to designate the region of eternal torment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and observed times</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">practised augury</span>. The rendering of A.V. is from the Vulgate, but that version in other places represents the sense as being ‘to use augury’. (See Vulg. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-3.htm" title="But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.">Isaiah 57:3</a>.) In the LXX. the renderings express the gathering of omens, either from sounds heard or from the flight of birds. The Jewish interpreters say it means one who decides by certain signs what days are good for trade, and which to travel on, &c. This is the idea in observing times, but the R.V. appears to embrace the whole of the senses given to the word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">used enchantments</span>] The word is that which is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-1.htm" title="And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.">Numbers 24:1</a> of Balaam going ‘to seek for enchantments’. It refers to gathering of signs as the superstitious are wont to do, from this or that, whether they are to do or leave undone any undertaking they contemplate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dealt with</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">with them that had</span>] <span class="ital">familiar spirits</span>] The Hebrew word <span class="ital">Ob</span>, usually translated ‘one that hath a familiar spirit’, means originally ‘a bottle’. It is applied first of all to the spirit supposed to reside within the persons so possessed; then to the person himself. After that because the answers were supposed to be derived from the spirits of the dead, it was applied to one called up from the dead. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-8.htm" title="And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray you, divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name to you.">1 Samuel 28:8</a> Saul asks at Endor ‘Divine unto me by <span class="ital">the familiar spirit</span>’. The second use of the word is exemplified in the verse before us, where those that deal with the spirit are called <span class="ital">Ob</span>, and the third sense is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a> where the voice of an <span class="ital">Ob</span> is said to come out of the ground and to whisper out of the dust. The LXX. renders the word by <span class="greekheb">ἐγγαστρίμυθος</span>, ventriloquist, probably because the utterances of ventriloquists seem to come from within the speaker without motion of the lips.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb rendered ‘deal with’ is literally ‘made’. Hence it has been thought that Manasseh gave offices to such persons as are here spoken of, and appointed (see R.V. marg.) them as official diviners.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wizards</span>] The Hebrew word is connected with the verb ‘to know’. Hence <span class="ital">wizard</span>, which implies one who is supposed to be preternaturally <span class="ital">wise</span> well represents the word.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made his son pass through the fire.</span> The author of Chronicles says, "his sons" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>); but this is, perhaps, rhetorical. It was usually the eldest son, who, as the most precious possible offering, was sacrificed to Moloch (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; and, for the true nature of the sacrifice, see the comment on this latter passage). <span class="cmt_word">And observed times.</span> If this translation is right, the reference would be to a superstitious regard for lucky and unlucky days, such as we note in the accounts left of themselves by the Baby-Ionian kings, who begin their buildings "in a happy month, on an auspicious day" (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 487). But probably the true meaning is, "he exercised <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>," or, "had regard to the evil eye," a common superstition in the East. <span class="cmt_word">And used enchantments.</span> A use of spoils is perhaps intended, such as those by which serpents (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) were charmed (see the comment on Isaiah 47:9). <span class="cmt_word">And dealt with familiar spirits and wizards</span> - rather, <span class="accented">he placed in office necromancers</span> (literally, a <span class="accented">necromancer</span>) <span class="accented">and wizards</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gave such persons official positions at his court, instead of putting them to death, as the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>) required - <span class="cmt_word">he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he multiplied to work wickedness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he sought out every possible way; he not only restored all the different kinds of heathen sacrifices and idolatrous customs which had been in use under Ahaz, but carried his opposition to Jehovah a great deal further. As Ewald says ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 208), "He endeavored to become acquainted with all the heathen religions he could find and introduce them into Judah. For this purpose he sent into the most distant lands where there was any famous cultus, and grudged no pains for his one object." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Close of Hezekiah's reign. - On the basin (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1495;) and the aqueduct constructed by him, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>. </body></html>
