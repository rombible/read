Elisha made hurtful food to become safe and wholesome. If a mess of pottage be all our dinner, remember that this great prophet had no better for himself and his guests. The table often becomes a snare, and that which should be for our welfare, proves a trap: this is a good reason why we should not feed ourselves without fear. When we are receiving the supports and comforts of life, we must keep up an expectation of death, and a fear of sin. We must acknowledge God's goodness in making our food wholesome and nourishing; I am the Lord that healeth thee. Elisha also made a little food go a great way. Having freely received, he freely gave. God has promised his church, that he will abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her poor with bread, Ps 132:15; whom he feeds, he fills; and what he blesses, comes to much. Christ's feeding his hearers was a miracle far beyond this, but both teach us that those who wait upon God in the way of duty, may hope to be supplied by Divine Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There was a dearth in the land - Rather, "The famine was in the land."

Elisha at Gilgal heals the noxious Pottage (Not in Chronicles)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">38</span>. <span class="ital">Elisha came again to Gilgal</span>] There are no notes of time in this narrative, or in the others, though we can see, here and there, that the events are not put together chronologically. (See below, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm" title="Then spoke Elisha to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.">2 Kings 8:1</a>.) Elisha had been at Gilgal with Elijah, but there is no need to suppose that ‘came again’ alludes to that visit. Gilgal (on which see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.">2 Kings 2:1</a> above) was a centre of prophetic activity and it is probable that it was visited frequently both by Elijah and Elisha.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> there was <span class="ital">a dearth in the land</span>] The first noun has the article, and the clause might well be rendered ‘<span class="ital">the</span> famine was in the land’. The allusion will then be to the famine foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm" title="Then spoke Elisha to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.">2 Kings 8:1</a>. That some of the incidents related before that chapter occurred after the famine, see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-4.htm" title="And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray you, all the great things that Elisha has done.">2 Kings 8:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the sons of the prophets</span> were <span class="ital">sitting before him</span>] They would naturally gather round the great prophet, made famous by a large share of Elijah’s spirit, and catch at all he had to say. We can see from this story one aspect of the life in the colleges of the prophets. The members sat at the feet of some elder member, and learnt from him their duty and how to carry it out. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-1.htm" title="And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with you is too strait for us.">2 Kings 6:1</a>, and note.) By Elisha’s teaching, which would be drawn from his own experience, they would gather faith and courage, seeing that God was working in their midst, and had not forsaken Israel in spite of their sins. Hence grew the hope of a thorough reformation in the breasts of these who must be regarded as the reformers of their time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto his servant</span>] Probably some one of the sons of the prophets, appointed to wait on Elisha while he tarried at Gilgal.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-41.</span> - 3.

He then lay down upon the boy, so that his mouth, his eyes, and his hands lay upon the mouth, eyes, and hands of the child, bowing down over him (&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42</a>); and the flesh (the body) of the child became warm. He then turned round, i.e., turned away from the boy, went once up and down in the room, and bowed himself over him again; whereupon the boy sneezed seven times, and then opened his eyes. This raising of the dead boy to life does indeed resemble the raising of the dead by Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-20.htm">1 Kings 17:20</a>.); but it differs so obviously in the manner in which it was effected, that we may see at once from this that Elisha did not possess the double measure of the spirit of Elijah. It is true that Elijah stretched himself three times upon the dead child, but at his prayer the dead returned immediately to life, whereas in the case of Elisha the restoration to life was a gradual thing.<p>(Note: The raising of the dead by Elijah and Elisha, especially by the latter, has been explained by many persons as being merely a revivification by magnetic manipulations or by the force of animal magnetism (even Passavant and Ennemoser adopt this view). But no dead person was ever raised to life by animal magnetism; and the assumption that the two boys were only apparently dead is at variance with the distinct words of the text, in addition to which, both Elisha and Elijah accomplished the miracle through their prayer, as is stated as clearly as possible both here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>) and also at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21-22</a>.)<p>And they both differ essentially from the raising of the dead by Christ, who recalled the dead to life by one word of His omnipotence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-39.htm">Mark 5:39-42</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-13.htm">Luke 7:13-15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>), a sign that He was the only-begotten Son of God, to whom the Father gave to have life in Himself, even as the Father has life in Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>.), in whose name the Apostle Peter also was able through prayer to recall the dead Tabitha to life, whereas Elisha and Elijah had only to prophesy by word and deed of the future revelation of the glory of God.</body></html>
