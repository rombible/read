Elisha’s walking to and fro is an index of intense excitement. He was earnestly expecting the fulfilment of his prayer.

It denotes a <span class= "ital">faint</span> rather than a <span class= "ital">loud</span> sneeze. (Heb., ‘<span class= "ital">atîshāh</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-10.htm" title="None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?">Job 41:10</a>.) It is omitted by the LXX., which has, “and he bowed himself over the boy until seven times.” The repeated sneezing was a sign of restored respiration. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-15.htm" title="And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.">Luke 7:15</a>.)<p>Keil supposes that whereas Elijah raised the widow’s son at once, his successor only restored the Shunammite’s son by degrees; and that this betokens an inferiority on the part of Elisha. But the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-17.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.">1Kings 17:17</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>. is plainly abridged.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-35.htm" title="Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.">2 Kings 4:35</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then he returned and walked in the house — </span>Exercising his mind in prayer to God. <span class="ital">And went up, </span>&c. — Repeating his former actions, to teach us not to be discouraged in our prayers, if we be not speedily answered. <span class="ital">And the child sneezed seven times </span>— Whereby his head was cleared, in which his pain had chiefly lain; <span class="ital">and the child opened his eyes </span>— So the work begun in the former verse is here perfected.

See here the power of God, who kills and makes alive again! see the power of prayer; as it has the key of the clouds, so it has the key of death! see the power of faith; that fixed law of nature, namely, that death is a way whence there is no returning, shall rather be dispensed with, than this believing Shunammite shall be disappointed!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:18-37 Here is the sudden death of the child. All the mother's tenderness cannot keep alive a child of promise, a child of prayer, one given in love. But how admirably does the prudent, pious mother, guard her lips under this sudden affliction! Not one peevish word escapes from her. Such confidence had she of God's goodness, that she was ready to believe that he would restore what he had now taken away. O woman, great is thy faith! He that wrought it, would not disappoint it. The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. She had not thought it enough to have Elisha's help sometimes in her own family, but, though a woman of rank, attended on public worship. It well becomes the men of God, to inquire about the welfare of their friends and their families. The answer was, It is well. All well, and yet the child dead in the house! Yes! All is well that God does; all is well with them that are gone, if they are gone to heaven; and all well with us that stay behind, if, by the affliction, we are furthered in our way thither. When any creature-comfort is taken from us, it is well if we can say, through grace, that we did not set our hearts too much upon it; for if we did, we have reason to fear it was given in anger, and taken away in wrath. Elisha cried unto God in faith; and the beloved son was restored alive to his mother. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls, must feel deeply for their case, and labour fervently in prayer for them. Though the minister cannot give Divine life to his fellow-sinners, he must use every means, with as much earnestness as if he could do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be stretched himself - Or, "prostrated himself."

The object of this command neither to salute nor to return salutations by the way, was not merely to ensure the greatest haste (Thenius and many others), inasmuch as the people of the East lose a great deal of time in prolonged salutations (Niebuhr, Beschr. v. Arab. p. 48),<p>(Note: Or, as C. a Lap. supposes: "that Gehazi might avoid all distraction of either eyes or ears, and prepare himself entirely by prayers for the accomplishment of so great a miracle." Theodoret explains it in a similar manner: "He knew that he was vainglorious and fond of praise, and that he would be sure to tell the reason of his journey to those who should meet him by the way. And vainglory is a hindrance to thaumaturgy.")<p>but the prophet wished thereby to preclude at the very outset the possibility of attributing the failure of Gehazi's attempt to awaken the child to any external or accidental circumstance of this kind. For since it is inconceivable that the prophet should have adopted a wrong method, that is to say, should have sent Gehazi with the hope that he would restore the dead boy to life, his only intention in sending the servant must have been to give to the Shunammite and her family, and possibly also to Gehazi himself, a practical proof that the power to work miracles was not connected in any magical way with his person or his staff, but that miracles as works of divine omnipotence could only be wrought through faith and prayer; not indeed with the secondary intention of showing that he alone could work miracles, and so of increasing his own importance (Kster), but to purify the faith of the godly from erroneous ideas, and elevate them from superstitious reliance upon his own human person to true reliance upon the Lord God.</body></html>
