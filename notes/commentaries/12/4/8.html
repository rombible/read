But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it fell on a day - The original of the expression here used, which occurs three times in the present narrative <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-11.htm">2 Kings 4:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-18.htm">2 Kings 4:18</a>, is also found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>.

Or so it was at a certain time: <p>that Elisha passed to Shunem; a city in the tribe of Issachar; of which see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>, <p>where was a great woman; of great wealth and riches, of great benevolence and hospitality, and of great grace and piety; that feared sin, as the Targum paraphrases it; a woman of great credit and reputation on all accounts. The Jews say (u) she was the sister of Abishag the Shunammite, and the mother of Iddo the prophet: <p>and she constrained him to eat bread; she had observed him at all times pass that way, and guessed by his habit and deportment that he was a religious man, and therefore took an opportunity to invite him into her house, and take a dinner with her; but he being modest and shy, she was obliged to use some pressing language, and be importunate with him, that he would accept of her invitation, which he did: <p>and so it was, that, as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread; being made very welcome, and encouraged by the free and kind entertainment he met with, as often as he had occasion to come that way, he called and took a meal with her; and this it seems was pretty often, for Shunem was not far from Carmel, which he frequented, and lay in the way to Samaria, Bethel, and Jericho, places he often visited, the schools of the prophets being there. <p>(u) T.

Elisha promises a son to the hospitable Shunammite (Not in Chronicles)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">And it fell on a day</span>] From its use elsewhere the Hebrew noun, as here, with the article signifies ‘on that day’, ‘at that time’, and indicates a closer connexion with the preceding narrative than would be gathered from the A.V. But see below, verses 11 and 18.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Elisha passed to Shunem</span>] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm" title="And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,">Joshua 19:18</a>, Shunem is among the places allotted to the tribe of Issachar. It is also mentioned as the place where the Philistines encamped before the battle of Gilboa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-4.htm" title="And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.">1 Samuel 28:4</a>). It has been identified with <span class="ital">Solam</span>, a village situate on the little Hermon about 3 miles north of Jezreel. When Elisha was travelling either from Samaria or Jezreel to Carmel, Shunem lay on his road. The place is mentioned as being the home of Abishag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-3.htm" title="So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.">1 Kings 1:3</a>) and from that is derived the Jewish tradition which makes the Shunammite woman of the present narrative to have been the sister of Abishag.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a great woman</span>] The adjective is used to signify <span class="ital">wealthy</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm" title="And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.">1 Samuel 25:2</a>, of Nabal, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-32.htm" title="Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.">2 Samuel 19:32</a> of Barzillai, who is described as ‘a very great man’. As the Shunammite woman had a husband still alive, it would be more natural to speak of him as ‘great’ in the sense of ‘rich’, and perhaps here the meaning is rather ‘influential’. She was clearly a person of independent character, and <span class="ital">one who</span> could act when the occasion demanded it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">she constrained him to eat bread</span>] The journeys of Elisha to and fro had somehow become known to her and she offered him hospitality. This was the usual way in the East, where houses for public entertainment were uncommon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as oft as he passed by</span>] Apparently the allusion is to such rounds as the chief of the prophetic colleges would make to the different centres at which they were gathered. That Elisha’s visits were frequent is clear from the next verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-37.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">The promise of a child to the Shunammite woman</span>, <span class="accented">and the restoration of the child to life</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it fall on a day, that.</span> The expression seems to be archaic. It occurs only here and in the opening chapters of the Book of Job (Job 1:6, 13; 2:1). The most literal rendering would be, <span class="accented">and the day came when</span>. Elisha passed to Shunem. Shunem was a village of Galilee, situated in the territory assigned to Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). It is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Solam</span>, at the south-eastern foot of the Gebel Duhy, or "Little Hermon," a "flourishing village encompassed by gardens" (Porter), and "in the midst of the finest corn-fields in the world" (Grove), on the edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. Elisha, in his progression to different parts of the northern kingdom, happened to come on one occasion to Shunem. <span class="cmt_word">Where was a great woman.</span> Houbigant strangely translates, "a tan woman," maintaining that a woman would not be called "great" in the sense of "wealthy" during her husband's lifetime; but no other commentator has accepted his view. The meaning seems to be that she was a woman of substance, one well-to-do, perhaps one that had brought her husband the bulk of his wealth. <span class="cmt_word">And she constrained him to eat bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she invited him in as he passed her house, and would take no denial. Compare Lot's pressing hospitality, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1-3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</span> Elisha, it appears, had frequent occasion to pass through Shunem on his way from Carmel to visit the cities of Galilee, or <span class="accented">versa</span>. It became his habit, on these journeys, to eat his meals at the house of the rich Shunammite. Hence arose a kindly feeling on both sides and a close intimacy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Widow's Cruse of Oil. - A poor widow of the scholars of the prophets complained to Elisha of her distress, namely, that a creditor was about to take her two sons as servants (slaves). The Mosaic law gave a creditor the right to claim the person and children of a debtor who was unable to pay, and they were obliged to serve him as slaves till the year of jubilee, when they were once more set free (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>). When the prophet learned, on inquiry that she had nothing in her house but a small flask of oil (&#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, means an anointing flask, a small vessel for the oil necessary for anointing the body), he told her to beg of all her neighbours empty vessels, not a few (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;, make not few, sc. to beg), and then to shut herself in with her sons, and to pour from her flask of oil into all these vessels till they were full, and then to sell this oil and pay her debt with the money, and use the rest for the maintenance of herself and her children. She was to close the house-door, that she might not be disturbed in her occupation by other people, and also generally to avoid all needless observation while the miracle was being performed. &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, let that which is filled be put on one side, namely by the sons, who handed her the vessels, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-5.htm">2 Kings 4:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-6.htm">2 Kings 4:6</a>, so that she was able to pour without intermission. The form &#1502;&#1497;&#1510;&#1511;&#1514; is a participle Piel, and is quite appropriate as an emphatic form; the Keri &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;&#1514; (Hiphil) is an unnecessary alteration, especially as the Hiphil of &#1497;&#1510;&#1511; is &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, then the oil stood, i.e., it ceased to flow. The asyndeton &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; is very harsh, and the Vav copul. has probably dropped out. With the alteration proposed by L. de Dieu, viz., of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; into &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;, "live with thy sons," the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497; would necessarily stand first (Thenius). </body></html>
