She seems not to have acquainted him with the child’s death; probably she feared, if he knew on what errand she wished to go to the prophet, lest he should not have faith enough to let her go. <span class="ital">Wherefore wilt thou go to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath — </span>It appears by this that the prophets acted as public instructers of the people; and that their houses were a kind of schools, or synagogues, unto which they resorted, upon the days here mentioned, to be taught their duty out of the law of God, and to have their doubts resolved. <span class="ital">And she said, It shall be well — </span>My going will not be troublesome to him, nor prejudicial to thee or me. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:18-37 Here is the sudden death of the child. All the mother's tenderness cannot keep alive a child of promise, a child of prayer, one given in love. But how admirably does the prudent, pious mother, guard her lips under this sudden affliction! Not one peevish word escapes from her. Such confidence had she of God's goodness, that she was ready to believe that he would restore what he had now taken away. O woman, great is thy faith! He that wrought it, would not disappoint it. The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. She had not thought it enough to have Elisha's help sometimes in her own family, but, though a woman of rank, attended on public worship. It well becomes the men of God, to inquire about the welfare of their friends and their families. The answer was, It is well. All well, and yet the child dead in the house! Yes! All is well that God does; all is well with them that are gone, if they are gone to heaven; and all well with us that stay behind, if, by the affliction, we are furthered in our way thither. When any creature-comfort is taken from us, it is well if we can say, through grace, that we did not set our hearts too much upon it; for if we did, we have reason to fear it was given in anger, and taken away in wrath. Elisha cried unto God in faith; and the beloved son was restored alive to his mother. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls, must feel deeply for their case, and labour fervently in prayer for them. Though the minister cannot give Divine life to his fellow-sinners, he must use every means, with as much earnestness as if he could do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men and one of the asses - All the "young men" and all the "asses" were in the harvest field, the young men cutting and binding the sheaves, and placing them upon carts or wains, the donkeys drawing these vehicles fully laden, to the threshing-floor.

Elisha then had her called again, and told her when she had entered the door: "At this time a year hence (&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, lit., at the time when it revives again; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>) thou wilt embrace a son."
