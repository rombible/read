But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do not lie - Compare a similar incredulity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>.

Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm" title="God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?">Numbers 23:19</a>, ‘God is not a man that <span class="ital">he should lie</span>’, and of God’s word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm" title="For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.">Habakkuk 2:3</a>), ‘It shall speak and not <span class="ital">lie</span>’.
