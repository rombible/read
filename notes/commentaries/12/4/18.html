The hand of Providence, however, was in the affliction, that occasion might be given to the prophet of working a wonderful miracle for the manifestation of the glory of God, like that which Elijah had wrought for the widow of Zarephath. <span class="ital">He sat on her knees till noon, and then died </span>— His pain was so violent, that it killed him in a few hours. <span class="ital">She laid him on the bed of the man of God </span>— The pious mother possesses her soul in patience under this surprising affliction: not one peevish, indecent word drops from her lips. She has a strong belief that the child will be raised to life again; like a genuine daughter of Abraham, she accounts <span class="ital">that God is able to raise him from the dead, </span>for she had at first received him by as great a miracle. She had doubtless heard of the raising the widow’s son at Zarephath, and that <span class="ital">the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha; </span>and such confidence had she of God’s goodness, that she was very ready to believe, He that so soon took away what he had given, would restore what he had now taken away. <span class="ital">By this faith women received their dead raised to life; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-35.htm" title="Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:">Hebrews 11:35</a>.

All the mother's tenderness cannot keep alive a child of promise, a child of prayer, one given in love. But how admirably does the prudent, pious mother, guard her lips under this sudden affliction! Not one peevish word escapes from her. Such confidence had she of God's goodness, that she was ready to believe that he would restore what he had now taken away. O woman, great is thy faith! He that wrought it, would not disappoint it. The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. She had not thought it enough to have Elisha's help sometimes in her own family, but, though a woman of rank, attended on public worship. It well becomes the men of God, to inquire about the welfare of their friends and their families. The answer was, It is well. All well, and yet the child dead in the house! Yes! All is well that God does; all is well with them that are gone, if they are gone to heaven; and all well with us that stay behind, if, by the affliction, we are furthered in our way thither. When any creature-comfort is taken from us, it is well if we can say, through grace, that we did not set our hearts too much upon it; for if we did, we have reason to fear it was given in anger, and taken away in wrath. Elisha cried unto God in faith; and the beloved son was restored alive to his mother. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls, must feel deeply for their case, and labour fervently in prayer for them. Though the minister cannot give Divine life to his fellow-sinners, he must use every means, with as much earnestness as if he could do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do not lie - Compare a similar incredulity in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>.

The husband of the Shunammite, the owner of several, was in one of them, superintending the cutting of his corn by the reapers; and the boy joined him there, as he had probably often done before. Country children delight in watching the various operations of the farmstead. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After some time, when Elisha had spent the night in the chamber provided for him, he wanted to make some acknowledgment to his hostess for the love which she had shown him, and told his servant Gehazi to call her, and say to her: "Thou hast taken all this care for us, what shall I do to thee? Hast thou (anything) to say to the king or the chief captain?" i.e., hast thou any wish that I could convey to them, and intercede for thee? There is something striking here in the fact that Elisha did not address the woman himself, as she was standing before him, but told her servant to announce to her his willingness to make some return for what she had done. This was, probably, simply from a regard to the great awe which she had of the "holy man of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-9.htm">2 Kings 4:9</a>), and to inspire her with courage to give expression to the wishes of her heart.<p>(Note: The conjecture that Elisha would not speak to her directly for the sake of maintaining his dignity, or that the historian looked upon such conversation with women as unbecoming in a teacher of the law (Thenius), is already proved to be untenable by <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-15.htm">2 Kings 4:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16</a>, where Elisha does speak to her directly.)<p>She answered: "I dwell among my people," i.e., not, I merely belong to the people (Thenius), but, I live quietly and peaceably among my countrymen, so that I have no need for any intercession with the king and great men of the kingdom. &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (Theodoret).</body></html>
