Bähr denies any miraculous increase of the food. He makes the miracle consist in the fact that the one hundred men were satisfied with the little they received, and even had some to spare. Similarly, Thenius thinks that the provisions were not inconsiderable for a hundred men (?), and that the emphasis of the narrative lies rather on Elisha’s absolute confidence in God than on His wonder-working powers; but this is certainly opposed to the sacred writer’s intention. Keil rightly calls attention to the fact that Elisha does not <span class= "ital">perform</span>, but only <span class= "ital">predicts</span>, this miracle.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:38-44 There was a famine of bread, but not of hearing the word of God, for Elisha had the sons of the prophets sitting before him, to hear his wisdom. Elisha made hurtful food to become safe and wholesome. If a mess of pottage be all our dinner, remember that this great prophet had no better for himself and his guests. The table often becomes a snare, and that which should be for our welfare, proves a trap: this is a good reason why we should not feed ourselves without fear. When we are receiving the supports and comforts of life, we must keep up an expectation of death, and a fear of sin. We must acknowledge God's goodness in making our food wholesome and nourishing; I am the Lord that healeth thee. Elisha also made a little food go a great way. Having freely received, he freely gave. God has promised his church, that he will abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her poor with bread, Ps 132:15; whom he feeds, he fills; and what he blesses, comes to much. Christ's feeding his hearers was a miracle far beyond this, but both teach us that those who wait upon God in the way of duty, may hope to be supplied by Divine Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This miracle was a faint foreshadowing of our Lord's far more marvelous feeding of thousands with even scantier materials. The resemblance is not only in the broad fact, but in various minute particulars, such as the distribution through the hands of others; the material, bread; the surprised question of the servant; and the evidence of superfluity in the fragments that were left (see the marginal references). As Elijah was a type of the Baptist, so Elisha was in many respects a type of our Blessed Lord. In his peaceful, non-ascetic life, in his mild and gentle character, in his constant circuits, in his many miracles of mercy, in the healing virtue which abode in his bodily frame <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>, he resembled, more than any other prophet, the Messiah, of whom all prophets were more or less shadows and figures. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>43. They shall eat, and shall leave thereof&#8212;This was not a miracle of Elisha, but only a prediction of one by the word of the Lord. Thus it differed widely from those of Christ (Mt 15:37; Mr 8:8; Lu 9:17; Joh 6:12).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So he set it before them,....

Elisha feeds one hundred men with twenty loaves (Not in Chronicles)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">44</span>. <span class="ital">from Baal-shalisha</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Baal-shalishah</span>. The name is found only here, and the LXX. writes it <span class="greekheb">Βαιθαρισὰ</span> or <span class="greekheb">Βαθσαρισά</span>, as though in this instance <span class="ital">Baal</span> had been interchangeable with the more common Hebrew prefix, in geographical names, <span class="ital">Beth</span>. The place cannot have been remote from Gilgal. The ‘land of Shalishah’ was close to mount Ephraim, as we see in the account of Saul’s search for the asses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-4.htm" title="And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.">1 Samuel 9:4</a>). Probably Baal-shalishah was one village or town of this district.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bread of the firstfruits</span>] On the custom of bringing an offering to the prophets, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm" title="Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?">1 Samuel 9:7</a>. In that case the present was spoken of in connexion with some enquiry to be made from him. And it may have been so here, though as the offering was from the first fruits, it may have been brought as a religious duty (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm" title="And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that you have brought an offering to your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:14</a>) and presented to Elisha, as the representative of God, in this time when there was no place to which such offerings could be brought. If this be so, it is another token, among many, that the law of Jehovah was not forgotten by some among the people in the northern kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">full</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">fresh</span>] <span class="ital">ears of corn</span>] This is the rendering of one word in the Hebrew, which from its use elsewhere seems to mean the first gathered and best of the corn. The interpreters explain it, some of the grain itself, some of the flour made from it. But the leading idea is its newness, hence the change to ‘fresh’ instead of ‘full’. The passages for comparison are <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm" title="And if you offer a meat offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the meat offering of your first fruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.">Leviticus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm" title="And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that you have brought an offering to your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:14</a>, in each of which the change has been made to ‘fresh’ in R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the husk thereof</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">in his sack</span>. The word is only found here. It is agreed however that it signifies some sort of bag. The A.V. took it of the covering of the grain, but the Vulgate gives <span class="ital">pera</span>, i.e., a scrip or wallet. The Complutensian text of the LXX. supports this rendering, the Alexandrine version attempts a transliteration of the unusual word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">44</span>. <span class="ital">they did eat, and left</span> thereof] Compare with this the miracles of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/14-15.htm" title="And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals....">Matthew 14:15-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-32.htm" title="Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way....">Matthew 15:32-38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-5.htm" title="When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he said to Philip, From where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?...">John 6:5-14</a>). In this account of Elisha there is however not much dwelling on the increase of the bread by a miracle, and we are left to accept the result as either brought about in that way, or by the appetites of the men being satisfied with a small quantity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX. omits ‘so he set it before them’ at the commencement of this verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord.</span> We are not expressly told how the miracle was wrought, whether by an augmentation of the quantity of the food supernaturally produced, or by a lessening of the appetites of the men, as Bahr supposes. But the analogy of our Lord's miracles of feeding the multitudes, whereof this is a manifest type, makes it probable that in this case also there was a miraculous increase of the food. The object of the writer in communicating the account is certainly not merely to show how the Lord cared for his servants, but to relate another miracle wrought by Elisha, of a different kind from those previously related. He is occupied with Elisha's miracles through this entire chanter and through the three next. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elisha Makes Uneatable Food Wholesome. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>.
