His expedition with Joram of Israel against Hazael at Ramoth-gilead. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest.

There is no difficulty in this, nor even in the supposition that Jehoram had begotten sons before Ahaziah, as Thenius seems to imagine. He may have become a father at thirteen or fourteen, and Athaliah was certainly not his only wife.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:25-29 Names do not make natures, but it was bad for Jehoshaphat's family to borrow names from Ahab's. Ahaziah's relation to Ahab's family was the occasion of his wickedness and of his fall. When men choose wives for themselves, let them remember they are choosing mothers for their children. Providence so ordered it, that Ahaziah might be cut off with the house of Ahab, when the measure of their iniquity was full. Those who partake with sinners in their sin, must expect to partake with them in their plagues. May all the changes, troubles, and wickedness of the world, make us more earnest to obtain an interest in the salvation of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the death of Jehoram, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-19</a>.

The writer continues the history of Judah through another reign  - a very short one-almost to its close. He describes the wickedness of Ahaziah, for the most part, in general terms, attributes it to his connection with the "house of <span class="accented">Ahab</span>," and notes his alliance with Joram of Israel against the Syrians, and his visit to his brother monarch at Samaria, which led on to his death. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab King of Israel.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-29.htm">2 Kings 9:29</a> the year of Ahaziah's accession is said to have been Joram's <span class="accented">eleventh</span> year. It is conjectured that he began to reign as viceroy to his father during his severe illness in Joram's eleventh year, and became sole king at his father's death in the year following. Did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram King of Judah begin to reign; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> begin to be full king. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joram had married a daughter of Ahab, namely Athaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>), and walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, transplanting the worship of Baal into his kingdom. Immediately after the death of Jehoshaphat he murdered his brothers, apparently with no other object than to obtain possession of the treasures which his father had left them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2-4</a>). This wickedness of Joram would have been followed by the destruction of Judah, had not the Lord preserved a shoot to the royal house for David's sake.
