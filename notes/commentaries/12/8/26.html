Ahaziah's relation to Ahab's family was the occasion of his wickedness and of his fall. When men choose wives for themselves, let them remember they are choosing mothers for their children. Providence so ordered it, that Ahaziah might be cut off with the house of Ahab, when the measure of their iniquity was full. Those who partake with sinners in their sin, must expect to partake with them in their plagues.

Athaliah is "the time for Yahweh;" Ahaziah "the possession of Yahweh;" Jehoram, or Joram, "exalted by Yahweh."<p>The daughter of Omri - "Son" and "daughter" were used by the Jews of any descendants (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). The whole race were "the children of Israel." Athaliah was the grand-daughter of Omri (see the margin). Her being called "the daughter of Omri" implies that an idea of special greatness was regarded as attaching to him, so that his name prevailed over that of Ahab. Indications of this ideal greatness are found in the Assyrian inscriptions, where the early name for Samaria is Beth-Omri, and where even Jehu has the title of "the son of Omri." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 8:24.

His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.">2 Chronicles 22:2</a> his age is given as <span class="ital">forty-two</span>. This cannot be correct, but is due to a misreading of the Hebrew letters which were used as numerals. Jehoram, the father of Ahaziah, was <span class="ital">thirty-two</span> years old (see verse 17) when he began to reign and he reigned eight years. If Ahaziah was two and twenty at his father’s death, he was born when Jehoram was eighteen. This is not uncommon in the East. Indeed we find from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest.

For this manner of speech cf. verse 20 of the next chapter, where Jehu is called the <span class="ital">son</span> of Nimshi, though he has been twice spoken of in previous verses (2, 14) as the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign. The writer of Chronicles says, "two and forty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>), which is absolutely impossible, since his father was but forty when he died (see ver. 17, and setup. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-5.htm">2 Chronicles 21:5, 20</a>). Even "two and twenty" is a more advanced age than we should have expected, since Ahaziah was the youngest of Jehoram's sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>); he must therefore have been born in his father's nineteenth year. Yet he had several elder brothers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a>)! To explain this, we have to remember <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the early age at which marriage is contracted in the East (twelve years); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fact that each prince had, besides his wife, several concubines. That Joram had several appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's Ares was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri King of Israel</span>. There is something very remarkable in the dignity and precedence attached to Omri. He was, no doubt, regarded of a sort of second founder of the kingdom of Israel, having been the first monarch to establish anything like a stable dynasty. His "statutes" were looked upon as the fundamental laws of the kingdom, and were "kept" down to the time of its destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>). Foreigners knew Samaria as <span class="accented">Beth</span>. <span class="accented">Khumri</span>, or "the house of Omri." He is the only Israelite king mentioned by name on the Moabite Stone (line 5), and the earliest mentioned in the inscriptions of Assyria. Even Jehu, who put an end to his dynasty, was regarded by the Assyrians as his descendant, and known under the designation of" Yahua, the son of Khnmri" (Black Obelisk, epig. 2.). Athallah, the daughter of Ahab, is called "the daughter of Omri," not only in the present passage, but also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nevertheless the divine chastisement was not omitted. The ungodliness of Joram was punished partly by the revolt of the Edomites and of the city of Libnah from his rule, and partly by a horrible sickness of which he died (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-15</a>). Edom, which had hitherto had only a vicegerent with the title of king (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), threw off the authority of Judah, and appointed its own king, under whom it acquired independence, as the attempt of Joram to bring it back again under his control completely failed. The account of this attempt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-9.htm">2 Chronicles 21:9</a> is very obscure. "Joram went over to Zair, and all his chariots of war with him; and it came to pass that he rose up by night and smote the Edomites round about, and indeed the captains of the war-chariots, and the people fled (i.e., the Judaean men of war, not the Edomites) to their tents." It is evident from this, that Joram had advanced to Zair in Idumaea; but there he appears to have been surrounded and shut in, so that in the night he fought his way through, and had reason to be glad that he had escaped utter destruction, since his army fled to their homes. &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is an unknown place in Idumaea, which Movers, Hitzig, and Ewald take to be Zoar, but without considering that Zoar was in the land of Moab, not in Edom. The Chronicles have instead &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1501;, "with his captains," from a mere conjecture; whilst Thenius regards &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; as altered by mistake from &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; ("to Seir"), which is very improbable in the case of so well-known a name as &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; is a later mode of writing for &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, probably occasioned by the frequently occurring word &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;. "To this day," i.e., to the time when the original sources of our books were composed. For the Edomites were subjugated again by Amaziah and Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>), though under Ahaz they made incursions into Judah again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). - At that time Libnah also revolted. This was a royal city of the early Canaanites, and at a later period it was still a considerable fortress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>). It is probably to be sought for in the ruins of Arak el Menshiyeh, two hours to the west of Beit-Jibrin (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>). This city probably revolted from Judah on the occurrence of an invasion of the land by the Philistines, when the sons of Joram were carried off, with the exception of the youngest, Jehoahaz (Ahaziah: <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16-17</a>). </body></html>
