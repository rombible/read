This apostasy would have led to the total extinction of the royal family in that kingdom, had it not been for the divine promise to David (2Sa 7:16). A national chastisement, however, was inflicted on Judah by the revolt of Edom, which, being hitherto governed by a tributary ruler (2Ki 3:9; 1Ki 22:47), erected the standard of independence (2Ch 21:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From under the hand of Judah; </span> under which they had been from David’s time, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm" title="And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants.

On the death of David, Edom seems to have revolted under a prince named Hadad, and to have re-established its independence. It had been again sub-jeered by the time of Jehoshaphat, who appointed a governor over it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>), and treated it as a portion of his own territories (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>). Now the yoke was finally thrown off, as had been prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>). Edom became once more a separate kingdom, and was especially hostile to Judah. In the reign of Ahaz the Edomites "smote Judah" and carried away many captives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). When the Chaldaeans attacked and besieged Jerusalem, they cried, "Down with it, down with it, even to the ground!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). They looked on with joy at the capture of the holy city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>), and "stood in the crossway, to cut off such as escaped" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>). After the return from the Captivity, they were still Judah's enemies, and am especially denounced as such by the Prophet Malachi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3-5</a>). In the Maccabee wars, we find them always on the Syrian side (1 Mac. 4:29, 61 1 Mac. 5:3 1 Mac. 6:31; 2 Macc. 10:15, etc.), doing their best to rivet the hateful yoke of the heathen on their suffering brethren. As Idumaeans, the Herodian family must have been specially hateful to the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">And made a king over themselves.</span> The king mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9, 26</a> was probably a mere vassal king under Jehoshaphat. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when Hazael replied in feigned humility, What is thy servant, the dog (i.e., so base a fellow: for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>), that he should do such great things?
