Ahaziah's relation to Ahab's family was the occasion of his wickedness and of his fall. When men choose wives for themselves, let them remember they are choosing mothers for their children. Providence so ordered it, that Ahaziah might be cut off with the house of Ahab, when the measure of their iniquity was full. Those who partake with sinners in their sin, must expect to partake with them in their plagues. May all the changes, troubles, and wickedness of the world, make us more earnest to obtain an interest in the salvation of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This war of the two kings against Hazael seems to have had for its object the recovery of Ramoth-gilead, which Ahab and Jehoshaphat had vainly attempted fourteen years earlier <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3-36</a>. Joram probably thought that the accession of a new and usurping monarch presented a favorable opportunity for a renewal of the war. It may also have happened that Hazael was engaged at the time upon his northern frontier with repelling one of those Assyrian attacks which seem by the inscriptions to have fallen upon him in quick succession during his earlier years. At any rate, the war appears to have been successful. Ramoth-gilead was recovered <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>, and remained probably thenceforth in the hands of the Israelites.<p>The Syrians wounded Joram - According to Josephus, Joram was struck by an arrow in the course of the siege, but remained until the place was taken.

Ramoth-gilead belonged to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?">1 Kings 22:3</a>) but now, as in Ahab’s reign, it was being seized by the Syrians. Joram, Ahab’s son, had ill-fortune like that of his father in the Syrian war, though as is evident from the next chapter he kept possession of Ramoth and left his officers there.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael King of Syria in Ramoth-Gilead.</span> Some translate, <span class="accented">and Joram himself went</span>; but this is a very rare use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, and one which would be unnatural in this place - for why "Joram himself," when "Joram" alone would have been quite sufficient? - and still more unnatural in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>, where the same phrase occurs. It is best, therefore, to follow our translators, who are in accord both with the Septuagint and with the Vulgate. Ahaziah followed the example of his grandfather Jehoshaphat, who had accompanied Ahab to Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29</a>), to fight against the Syrians in the time of Benhadad. That the city was still disputed shows the importance which it possessed in the eyes of both parties. <span class="cmt_word">And the Syrians wounded Joram.</span> It appears that Hazael, soon after his accession, with the ardor of a young prince anxious to distinguish himself, made an expedition against Ramoth-Gilead, which had been recovered by the Israelites between the death of Ahab and the time of which the historian is now treating. Joram went to the relief of the town with a large force, and, being received within the walls, maintained a gallant defense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>), in the course of which he was wounded severely, though not fatally. Thereupon he and his brother king quitted the town and returned to their respective capitals, leaving a strong garrison in Ramoth-Gilead under Jehu and some other captains. Joram needed rest and careful nursing on account of his wounds, and Ahaziah would naturally withdraw with him; since he could not serve under a mere general. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nevertheless the divine chastisement was not omitted. The ungodliness of Joram was punished partly by the revolt of the Edomites and of the city of Libnah from his rule, and partly by a horrible sickness of which he died (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-15</a>). Edom, which had hitherto had only a vicegerent with the title of king (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), threw off the authority of Judah, and appointed its own king, under whom it acquired independence, as the attempt of Joram to bring it back again under his control completely failed. The account of this attempt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-9.htm">2 Chronicles 21:9</a> is very obscure. "Joram went over to Zair, and all his chariots of war with him; and it came to pass that he rose up by night and smote the Edomites round about, and indeed the captains of the war-chariots, and the people fled (i.e., the Judaean men of war, not the Edomites) to their tents." It is evident from this, that Joram had advanced to Zair in Idumaea; but there he appears to have been surrounded and shut in, so that in the night he fought his way through, and had reason to be glad that he had escaped utter destruction, since his army fled to their homes. &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is an unknown place in Idumaea, which Movers, Hitzig, and Ewald take to be Zoar, but without considering that Zoar was in the land of Moab, not in Edom. The Chronicles have instead &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1501;, "with his captains," from a mere conjecture; whilst Thenius regards &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; as altered by mistake from &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; ("to Seir"), which is very improbable in the case of so well-known a name as &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; is a later mode of writing for &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, probably occasioned by the frequently occurring word &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;. "To this day," i.e., to the time when the original sources of our books were composed. For the Edomites were subjugated again by Amaziah and Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>), though under Ahaz they made incursions into Judah again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). - At that time Libnah also revolted. This was a royal city of the early Canaanites, and at a later period it was still a considerable fortress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>). It is probably to be sought for in the ruins of Arak el Menshiyeh, two hours to the west of Beit-Jibrin (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>). This city probably revolted from Judah on the occurrence of an invasion of the land by the Philistines, when the sons of Joram were carried off, with the exception of the youngest, Jehoahaz (Ahaziah: <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16-17</a>). </body></html>
