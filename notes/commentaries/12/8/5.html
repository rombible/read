It is well to foresee an evil, and wisdom, when we foresee it, to hide ourselves if we lawfully may do so. When the famine was over, she returned out of the land of the Philistines; that was no proper place for an Israelite, any longer than there was necessity for it. Time was when she dwelt so securely among her own people, that she had no occasion to be spoken for to the king; but there is much uncertainty in this life, so that things or persons may fail us which we most depend upon, and those befriend us which we think we shall never need. Sometimes events, small in themselves, prove of consequence, as here; for they made the king ready to believe Gehazi's narrative, when thus confirmed. It made him ready to grant her request, and to support a life which was given once and again by miracle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>During the Shunammite's absence in Philistia, her dwelling and her grain-fields had been appropriated by some one who refused to restore them. She therefore determined to appeal to the king. Such direct appeals are common in Oriental countries.

The providence of God so ordained that King Jehoram had been led to inquire, with great interest, into the miraculous deeds of Elisha, and that the prophet's servant was in the act of relating the marvellous incident of the restoration of the Shunammite's son when she made her appearance to prefer her request. The king was pleased to grant it; and a state officer was charged to afford her every facility in the recovery of her family possession out of the hands of the occupier.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The woman was by God’s wonderful and gracious providence brought thither in the most advantageous season. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life,....

As an eye-witness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29-36</a>), he could give all the details. <span class="cmt_word">That, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.</span> The coincidence can scarcely have been accidental. Divine providence so ordered matters that, just when the king's interest in the woman was most warm, she should appear before him to urge her claim. At another time, Jehoram would, it is probable, have been but slightly moved by her complaint. Under the peculiar circumstances, he was deeply moved, and at once granted the woman the redress for which she asked. <span class="cmt_word">And Gehazi said, Wry lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span> The Shunammite was accompanied by her son, now a boy of at least tea or eleven years old - the actual object of Elisha's miracle. The king's interest in the woman would be still more roused by this circumstance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the returning messengers reported this, the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians, and this was followed by the consequent cheapness of provisions predicted by Elisha. As the people streamed out, the unbelieving aide-de-camp, whom the king had ordered to take the oversight at the gate (&#1492;&#1508;&#1511;&#1497;&#1491;, to deliver the oversight) for the purpose of preserving order in the crowding of the starving multitude, was trodden down by the people, so that he died, whereby this prediction of Elisha was fulfilled. The exact fulfilment of this prediction appeared so memorable to the historian, that he repeats this prophecy in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-18.htm">2 Kings 7:18-20</a> along with the event which occasioned it, and refers again to its fulfilment. </body></html>
