Under the influence of his wife Athaliah, as it may be surmised, Jehoram slew his six brothers directly after his accession to the throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm" title="Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brothers with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.">2Chronicles 21:4</a>). In this connection the remarks of Michaelis are interesting: “In the reign of Jehoram falls the building of Carthage; Dido, her husband Sichæus, her brother Pygmalion, king of Tyre, and murderer of Sichæus. By marriage Tyre brought its then prevalent spirit, and a vast amount of evil,into the two Israelitish kingdoms.” (The Syriac, Arabic, and Vulg. read “in the ways.”) The reason why the details added in Chronicles are here omitted is to be found in the studied brevity of the compiler in the case of less important characters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm" title="And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.">2 Kings 8:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel — </span>That is, after his father’s death. <span class="ital">For the daughter of Ahab — </span>Namely, Athaliah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm" title="Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.

This unequal marriage, though Jehoshaphat possibly designed it as a means of uniting the two kingdoms under one head, is here and elsewhere noted, as the cause both of the great wickedness of his posterity, and of those sore calamities which befell them.

This apostasy would have led to the total extinction of the royal family in that kingdom, had it not been for the divine promise to David (2Sa 7:16). A national chastisement, however, was inflicted on Judah by the revolt of Edom, which, being hitherto governed by a tributary ruler (2Ki 3:9; 1Ki 22:47), erected the standard of independence (2Ch 21:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, </span> after his father’s death. <span class="ital">The daughter of Ahab</span>; Athaliah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm" title="Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.

(On the nature of this worship, see the ' Commentary on the First Book of Kings,' p. 374.) The "house of Ahab" maintained and spread the Baal-worship, wherever it had influence. Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, championed it in Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-53.htm">1 Kings 22:53</a>); Jehoram, his brother, allowed its continuance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>); Jehoram of Judah was induced by his wife, Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, to countenance it in Judaea; Athaliah, when she usurped the throne upon the death of her son Ahaziah, made it the state religion in that country. "Evil communications corrupt good manners." The alliance of the two separated kingdoms, concluded between Jehoshaphat and Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2-4</a>), had no tangible result beyond the introduction into Judah of the licentious and debasing superstition which had previously overspread the sister country. <span class="cmt_word">For the daughter of Ahab was his wife.</span> In ver. 26 Athaliah, the wife of Jehoram, is called "the daughter of Omri;" but by "daughter" in that place must be meant "descendant" or "granddaughter." Athaliah has been well called "a second Jezebel." <span class="cmt_word">And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> The wicked actions of Jehoram are recorded at some length in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2-4, 11-13</a>). Shortly after his accession he put to death his six brothers - Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Ahaziah (?), Michael, and Shephatiah - in order to "strengthen himself." At the same time, he caused many of the "princes of Israel" to be executed. Soon afterwards he "made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to become idolaters), "and compelled Judah thereto." That the idolatry, which he introduced, was the Baal-worship is clear, both from the present passage and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-13.htm">2 Chronicles 21:13</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Hazael asked him the cause of his weeping, Elisha replied: "I know the evil which thou wilt do to the sons of Israel: their fortresses wilt thou set on fire (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>), their youths wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children to pieces, and cut asunder their women with child" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506;, split, cut open the womb). This cruel conduct towards Israel which is here predicted of Hazael, was only a special elaboration of the brief statement made by the Lord to Elijah concerning Hazael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-17.htm">1 Kings 19:17</a>). The fulfilment of this prediction is indicated generally in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>.; and we may infer with certainty from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1</a>, that Hazael really practised the cruelties mentioned. </body></html>
