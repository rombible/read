This apostasy would have led to the total extinction of the royal family in that kingdom, had it not been for the divine promise to David (2Sa 7:16). A national chastisement, however, was inflicted on Judah by the revolt of Edom, which, being hitherto governed by a tributary ruler (2Ki 3:9; 1Ki 22:47), erected the standard of independence (2Ch 21:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. The common soldiers of the Edomites, herein following the example of their captains. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Joram went over to Zair,....

In the parallel passage of 2 Chronicles 21. we find ‘with his princes’ instead of ‘to Zair’, and as there is some similarity of sound between the two Hebrew forms, it has been thought by some that there is a mistake in Kings from some misreading of the scribe. Others have suggested that ‘Zair’ is for ‘Zoar’, through which place troops marching from Judæa into Edom would have to pass. Others with much more probability have taken Zair (<span class="greekheb">צעיר</span>), to be a miswriting for Seir (<span class="greekheb">שׂעיר</span>) the name of the mountain ridge which extends southward from the Dead Sea through the desert. It is true ‘Seir’ is not named elsewhere by the writer of Kings, but there seems to be no occasion where he might be expected to mention it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he rose</span> [R.V. inserts <span class="bld">up</span>] <span class="ital">by night and smote the Edomites which compassed him about</span>] Joram appears to have been surrounded by the Edomite forces, and for some time to have had the worst of the contest. It was only by a sudden sally in the night time that he forced his way out, and escaped. The captains of the Edomite chariots, mentioned here, most likely formed the outer circle of the enclosing force, and through them Joram passed last.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the people fled into</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">to</span>] <span class="ital">their tents</span>] ‘The people’ are the army of Joram, which after escaping from their encircling enemy made the best of their way home, feeling that Edom was too strong for them.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Joram went over to Zair.</span> Naturally, Joram did not allow Edom to become independent without an attempt to reduce it. He invaded the country in full force, taking up a position at a place called Zair, which is not otherwise known. Zair (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) can scarcely be Zoar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), which, wherever it was, was certainly not in Edom; and it is hardly likely to be a corruption of "Seir" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>), since the utterly unknown <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> would scarcely be put by a copyist in the place of the well-known <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>. Moreover, if Mount Seir were intended, it would probably have had the prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-2.htm">Ezekiel 35:2, 3, 7, 15</a>. "Seir" alone is poetical rather than historical, especially in the language of the later books of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">And all the chariots with him</span>; or, <span class="accented">all his chariots</span> (Revised Version). The article has the force of the possessive pronoun. <span class="cmt_word">And he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about.</span> Josephus understands the writer to mean that Joram made his invasion by night, and smote the Edomites on all sides ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:5. &sect; 1); but it seems better to suppose, with most modern commentators, that the meaning is the following: Soon after Joram invaded the country, he found himself surrounded and blocked in by the Edomite troops, and could only save himself by a night attack, which was so far successful that he broke through the enemy's lines and escaped; his army, however, was so alarmed at the danger it had run, that it at once dispersed and returned home<span class="cmt_word">. And the captains of the chariots</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the captains of the Edomite chariots. They too were "smitten," having probably taken the chief part in trying to prevent the escape. <span class="cmt_word">And the people fled into their tents</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dispersed to their homes. Compare the cry of Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>), "To your tents, O Israel!" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when Hazael replied in feigned humility, What is thy servant, the dog (i.e., so base a fellow: for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>), that he should do such great things? Elisha said to him, "Jehovah has shown thee to me as king over Aram;" whereupon Hazael returned to his lord, brought him the pretended answer of Elisha that he would live (recover), and the next day suffocated him with a cloth dipped in water. &#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, to plait or twist, literally, anything twisted; not, however, a net for gnats or flies (Joseph., J. D. Mich., etc.), but a twisted thick cloth, which when dipped in water became so thick, that when it was spread over the face of the sick man it was sufficient to suffocate him. </body></html>
