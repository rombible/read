And he answered, He told me that you should surely recover.">2Kings 8:14</a>, is without the negative particle. (See the Note there.) The Authorised Version is, therefore, right.<p><span class= "bld">Thou mayest certainly recover.</span>—Rather. <span class= "ital">Thou wilt certainly live</span>. Elisha sees through Hazaeľs character and designs, and answers him in the tone of irony which he used to Gehazi in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-26.htm" title="And he said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?">2Kings 5:26</a>, “Go, tell thy lord—as thou, the supple and unscrupulous courtier wilt be sure to do—he will certainly recover. I know, however, that he will assuredly die, and by thy hand.” Others interpret, “<span class= "ital">Thou mightest</span> recover” (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, thy disease is not mortal); and make the rest of the propheťs reply a confidential communication to Hazael. But this is to represent the prophet as deceiving Benhadad, and guilty of complicity with Hazael, which agrees neither with Elisha’s character nor with what follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/8-11.htm" title="And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.">2Kings 8:11-12</a>. The Syriac and Arabic, with some MSS., read, “<span class= "ital">thou</span> wilt die” for “<span class= "ital">he</span> will die.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-10.htm" title="And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You may certainly recover: however, the LORD has showed me that he shall surely die.">2 Kings 8:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit, </span>&c. — Here is no contradiction: for the first words contain an answer to Ben- hadad’s question, <span class="ital">Shall I recover? </span>To which the answer is, <span class="ital">Thou mayest, </span>notwithstanding thy disease, which is not mortal. The latter words contain the prophet’s addition to that answer, which is, that he should die, not by the power of his disease, but by some other cause. But it must be observed, that this is according, not to the Hebrew text, but the marginal reading of the Jewish rabbins, who have substituted the pronoun <span class="greekheb">לו</span>, <span class="ital">lo, to him, </span>for the adverb <span class="greekheb">לא</span>, <span class="ital">lo, not. </span>In the text it is, <span class="ital">Go say, Thou shalt not recover; </span>or, as Dr. Waterland renders it, <span class="ital">Thou shalt certainly not live; for the Lord hath showed me that he shall surely die. </span>Dr. Kennicott is clearly of opinion that this is the true reading and sense of the passage. See his first <span class="ital">Dissert., </span>p. 163. Houbigant, however, prefers our translation, and thinks that the words contain a silent reproof from Elisha, who well knew that a courtier, like Hazael, would certainly flatter his king: he therefore understands the meaning to be, <span class="ital">“Go thou, and, </span>courtier-like, <span class="ital">say to him, Thou wilt certainly recover; howbeit, the Lord hath, shown me </span>very much the contrary; <span class="ital">he will surely die, </span>and die by thy traitorous hand.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:7-15 Among other changes of men's minds by affliction, it often gives other thoughts of God's ministers, and teaches to value the counsels and prayers of those whom they have hated and despised. It was not in Hazael's countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but God revealed it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes: the more foresight men have, the more grief they are liable to. It is possible for a man, under the convictions and restraints of natural conscience, to express great abhorrence of a sin, yet afterwards to be reconciled to it. Those that are little and low in the world, cannot imagine how strong the temptations of power and prosperity are, which, if ever they arrive at, they will find how deceitful their hearts are, how much worse than they suspected. The devil ruins men, by saying they shall certainly recover and do well, so rocking them asleep in security. Hazael's false account was an injury to the king, who lost the benefit of the prophet's warning to prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha, who would be counted a false prophet. It is not certain that Hazael murdered his master, or if he caused his death it may have been without any design. But he was a dissembler, and afterwards proved a persecutor to Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Translate - "Go, say unto him, Thou shalt certainly live: howbeit the Lord hath showed me that he shall certainly die." i. e.," Say to him, what thou hast already determined to say, what a courtier is sure to say (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-15.htm">1 Kings 22:15</a>), but know that the fact will be otherwise." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Go, say &#8230; Thou mayest certainly recover&#8212;There was no contradiction in this message. This part was properly the answer to Ben-hadad's inquiry [2Ki 8:9]. The second part was intended for Hazael, who, like an artful and ambitious courtier, reported only as much of the prophet's statement as suited his own views (compare 2Ki 8:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here is no contradiction; for the first words contain an answer to Ben-hadad’s question, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-8.htm" title="And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?">2 Kings 8:8</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall I recover of this disease?</span> To which the answer is, <span class="ital">Thou mayest or shalt recover</span>, i.e. notwithstanding thy disease, which is not mortal, and shall not take away thy life. The latter words contain the prophet’s explication of or addition to that answer, which is, that he should die, not by the power of his disease, but by some other cause. But it is observable, that in the Hebrew text it is lo, the adverb, which signifies not; which though most affirm to be put for to, the pronoun, signifying to him; yet others take it as it lies, and translate the words thus, <span class="ital">Say, Thou shalt not recover; for the Lord hath showed me that he shall surely die</span>. Or, according to the former reading, the first words may be taken interrogatively, <span class="ital">Say unto him, Shalt thou indeed recover</span>?

That is, of the disease; and there was not only a probability that he might recover of it, it not being a mortal one, but a certainty that he should not die of it, as he did not, but die a violent death, which the prophet predicts in the next clause; though some take these words not as a command, what he should say, but as a prediction of what he would say; that he would go and tell him he should certainly recover, because he would not discourage him, though the prophet assures him in the next clause that he should die: there is a various reading of these words; we follow the marginal reading, but the textual reading is, "say, thou shall not certainly recover", or "in living live"; which agrees with what follows: <p>howbeit or "for" <p>the Lord hath showed me, that he shall surely die; though not of that sickness, nor a natural death, but a violent one, and that by the hand of this his servant, though he does not express it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.</span><p>(f) Meaning that he would recover of this disease: but he knew that this messenger Hazael would slay him to obtain the kingdom.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">shalt surely</span>] <span class="ital">recover</span>] This is not the translation of the Hebrew text (<span class="ital">Kethib</span>) but of the marginal reading [<span class="ital">Keri</span>]. The variation is between <span class="greekheb">לא</span> the negative and <span class="greekheb">לו</span> the pronoun and preposition. The text would be rendered ‘Go say; Thou shalt <span class="ital">not</span> recover’. This does not suit with what follows, ‘Howbeit the Lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die’. We should expect ‘For the Lord &c.’ The meaning of the prophet’s words is, ‘Go and carry him such a message as a courtier is likely to carry, a message of good promise, for this I know you are likely to do, yet the Lord has made known to me that he will die’. The R.V. has given the translation of the <span class="ital">Kethib</span> on the margin, but as that is so little in harmony with the context, has translated the <span class="ital">Keri</span> in the text, though this is contrary to the usual rule of the Revisers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another way of explaining the language of Elisha has been adopted by some. It is pointed out that the king’s question was ‘Shall I recover of this disease?’ Elisha, forewarned of the events that were coming, gives as answer to that enquiry ‘Thou shalt surely recover’, meaning thereby that the disease would not kill Benhadad, but suppresses that other source whence danger and death threatened, viz., the murderous hands of Hazael, which he knew would soon slay his master. This seems very unlike the manner of a prophet of the Lord. The explanation previously given is therefore to be preferred. Bp Hall takes the later explanation, ‘The Lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die, by another means, though not by the disease’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said unto him; Go, say unto him; Thou mayest certainly recover.</span> The existing Masoretic text (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>) is untranslatable, since <span class="accented">emar-lo</span> cannot mean, "say not," on account of the order of the words; and <span class="accented">lo</span> cannot he joined with <span class="accented">khayiah thikhyah</span>, first on account of the makkeph whick attaches it to <span class="accented">emar</span>, and secondly because the emphatic infinitive is in itself affirmative, and does not admit of a negative prefix.
