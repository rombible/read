Ahaziah's relation to Ahab's family was the occasion of his wickedness and of his fall. When men choose wives for themselves, let them remember they are choosing mothers for their children. Providence so ordered it, that Ahaziah might be cut off with the house of Ahab, when the measure of their iniquity was full. Those who partake with sinners in their sin, must expect to partake with them in their plagues. May all the changes, troubles, and wickedness of the world, make us more earnest to obtain an interest in the salvation of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Such names as Athaliah, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, indicate that the Baal-worshipping kings of Israel did not openly renounce the service of Yahweh. Athaliah is "the time for Yahweh;" Ahaziah "the possession of Yahweh;" Jehoram, or Joram, "exalted by Yahweh."<p>The daughter of Omri - "Son" and "daughter" were used by the Jews of any descendants (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). The whole race were "the children of Israel." Athaliah was the grand-daughter of Omri (see the margin). Her being called "the daughter of Omri" implies that an idea of special greatness was regarded as attaching to him, so that his name prevailed over that of Ahab. Indications of this ideal greatness are found in the Assyrian inscriptions, where the early name for Samaria is Beth-Omri, and where even Jehu has the title of "the son of Omri." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 8:24.

The ungodliness of Joram was punished partly by the revolt of the Edomites and of the city of Libnah from his rule, and partly by a horrible sickness of which he died (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-15</a>). Edom, which had hitherto had only a vicegerent with the title of king (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), threw off the authority of Judah, and appointed its own king, under whom it acquired independence, as the attempt of Joram to bring it back again under his control completely failed. The account of this attempt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm">2 Kings 8:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-9.htm">2 Chronicles 21:9</a> is very obscure. "Joram went over to Zair, and all his chariots of war with him; and it came to pass that he rose up by night and smote the Edomites round about, and indeed the captains of the war-chariots, and the people fled (i.e., the Judaean men of war, not the Edomites) to their tents." It is evident from this, that Joram had advanced to Zair in Idumaea; but there he appears to have been surrounded and shut in, so that in the night he fought his way through, and had reason to be glad that he had escaped utter destruction, since his army fled to their homes. &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is an unknown place in Idumaea, which Movers, Hitzig, and Ewald take to be Zoar, but without considering that Zoar was in the land of Moab, not in Edom. The Chronicles have instead &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1501;, "with his captains," from a mere conjecture; whilst Thenius regards &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; as altered by mistake from &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; ("to Seir"), which is very improbable in the case of so well-known a name as &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; is a later mode of writing for &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, probably occasioned by the frequently occurring word &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;. "To this day," i.e., to the time when the original sources of our books were composed. For the Edomites were subjugated again by Amaziah and Uzziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>), though under Ahaz they made incursions into Judah again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). - At that time Libnah also revolted. This was a royal city of the early Canaanites, and at a later period it was still a considerable fortress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>). It is probably to be sought for in the ruins of Arak el Menshiyeh, two hours to the west of Beit-Jibrin (see the Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>). This city probably revolted from Judah on the occurrence of an invasion of the land by the Philistines, when the sons of Joram were carried off, with the exception of the youngest, Jehoahaz (Ahaziah: <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16-17</a>). </body></html>
