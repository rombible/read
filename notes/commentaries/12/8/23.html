This apostasy would have led to the total extinction of the royal family in that kingdom, had it not been for the divine promise to David (2Sa 7:16). A national chastisement, however, was inflicted on Judah by the revolt of Edom, which, being hitherto governed by a tributary ruler (2Ki 3:9; 1Ki 22:47), erected the standard of independence (2Ch 21:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-19.htm" title="And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.">1 Kings 14:19</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

In consequence of this a writing is said to have come to him from Elijah the prophet rebuking him for his evil doing, and telling of the painful disease by which he should die. We read there also of revolts against Joram by the Philistines and the Arabians, and that by the latter all the king’s family were cut off except his youngest son. Moreover that when he died the people made no burning for him, as had been done at the death of his ancestors, and that ‘he departed without being desired’, i.e. none missed him or lamented for him when he died. Also that though buried in the city of David, his body was not put into the sepulchres of the kings. This last statement is no contradiction of what is contained in verse 24 of this chapter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the sets of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> Some of these acts are recorded in our present Second Book of Chronicles; e.g. his execution of his brothers and of many nobles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>); his erection of high places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>); his persecution of the followers of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>); his reception of a writing from Elisha, which, however, had no effect upon his conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-15</a>); his war with the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>) and with the Arabs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>); his loss of all his sons but one during his lifetime; his long illness, and his painful death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-18.htm">2 Chronicles 21:18, 19</a>).
