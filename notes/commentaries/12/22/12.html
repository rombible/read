Those best honour their Bibles, who study them; daily feed on that bread, and walk by that light. Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this inquiry, What shall we do to be saved? Also, what we may expect, and must provide for. Those who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath, cannot but be very anxious how they may be saved. Huldah let Josiah know what judgments God had in store for Judah and Jerusalem. The generality of the people were hardened, and their hearts unhumbled, but Josiah's heart was tender. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he humbled himself before the Lord. Those who most fear God's wrath, are least likely to feel it. Though Josiah was mortally wounded in battle, yet he died in peace with God, and went to glory. Whatever such persons suffer or witness, they are gathered to the grave in peace, and shall enter into the rest which remaineth for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He rent his clothes - Partly grief and horror, like Reuben <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a> and Job J<a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-20.htm">Obadiah 1:20</a>, partly in repentance, like Ahab <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15. the king commanded &#8230; Go, inquire of the Lord for me, &c.&#8212;The agitated feelings of the king prompted him to ask immediate counsel how to avert those curses under which his kingdom lay; and forthwith a deputation of his principal officers was sent to one endowed with the prophetic spirit.<p>Ahikam&#8212;a friend of Jeremiah (Jer 26:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A servant of the king’s, </span> who most constantly waited upon the king’s person; otherwise all of them were the king’s servants. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest,....

The apodosis to &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, "it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah-the king had sent Shaphan," etc., does not follow till <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a> : "that Hilkiah said," etc. The principal fact which the historian wished to relate, was the discovery of the book of the law; and the repairing of the temple is simply mentioned because it was when Shaphan was sent to Hilkiah about the payment of the money to the builders that the high priest informed the king's secretary of state of the discovery of the book of the law in the temple, and handed it over to him to take to the king. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>, forms the commencement to the minor clauses inserted within the principal clause, and subordinate to it: "the king had sent Shaphan," etc. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>, the king had deputed not only Shaphan the state-secretary, but also Maaseiah the governor of the city and Joach the chancellor, because the repairing of the temple was not a private affair of the king and the high priest, but concerned the city generally, and indeed the whole kingdom. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-5.htm">2 Kings 22:5</a> there follows the charge given by the king to Shaphan: "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may make up the money, ... and hand it over to the workmen appointed over the house of Jehovah," etc. &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, Hiphil, signifies to finish or set right, i.e., not pay out (Ges., Dietr.), but make it up for the purpose of paying out, namely, collect it from the door-keepers, count it, and bind it up in bags (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-11.htm">2 Kings 12:11</a>). &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is therefore quite appropriate here, and there is no alteration of the text required. The door-keepers had probably put the money in a chest placed at the entrance, as was the case at the repairing of the temple in the time of Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-10.htm">2 Kings 12:10</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-5.htm">2 Kings 22:5</a> the Keri &#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is a bad alteration of the Chethb &#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;, "and give (it) into the hand," which is perfectly correct. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; might denote both the masters and the workmen (builders), and is therefore defined more precisely first of all by &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, "who had the oversight at the house of Jehovah," i.e., the masters or inspectors of the building, and secondly by &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, who were (occupied) at the house of Jehovah, whilst in the Chronicles it is explained by &#1497; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;.
