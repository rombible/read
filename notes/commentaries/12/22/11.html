Those best honour their Bibles, who study them; daily feed on that bread, and walk by that light. Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this inquiry, What shall we do to be saved? Also, what we may expect, and must provide for. Those who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath, cannot but be very anxious how they may be saved. Huldah let Josiah know what judgments God had in store for Judah and Jerusalem. The generality of the people were hardened, and their hearts unhumbled, but Josiah's heart was tender. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he humbled himself before the Lord. Those who most fear God's wrath, are least likely to feel it. Though Josiah was mortally wounded in battle, yet he died in peace with God, and went to glory. Whatever such persons suffer or witness, they are gathered to the grave in peace, and shall enter into the rest which remaineth for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He rent his clothes - Partly grief and horror, like Reuben <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a> and Job J<a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-20.htm">Obadiah 1:20</a>, partly in repentance, like Ahab <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 22:8-15. Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law.<p>8-11. Hilkiah said &#8230; I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord, &c.&#8212;that is, the law of Moses, the Pentateuch. It was the temple copy which, had been laid (De 31:25, 26) beside the ark in the most holy place. During the ungodly reigns of Manasseh and Amon&#8212;or perhaps under Ahaz, when the temple itself had been profaned by idols, and the ark also (2Ch 35:3) removed from its site; it was somehow lost, and was now found again during the repair of the temple [Keil]. Delivered by Hilkiah the discoverer to Shaphan the scribe [2Ki 22:8], it was by the latter shown and read to the king. It is thought, with great probability, that the passage read to the king, and by which the royal mind was so greatly excited, was a portion of Deuteronomy, the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth chapters, in which is recorded a renewal of the national covenant, and an enumeration of the terrible threats and curses denounced against all who violated the law, whether prince or people. The impressions of grief and terror which the reading produced on the mind of Josiah have seemed to many unaccountable. But, as it is certain from the extensive and familiar knowledge displayed by the prophets, that there were numbers of other copies in popular circulation, the king must have known its sacred contents in some degree. But he might have been a stranger to the passage read him, or the reading of it might, in the peculiar circumstances, have found a way to his heart in a manner that he never felt before. His strong faith in the divine word, and his painful consciousness that the woeful and long-continued apostasies of the nation had exposed them to the infliction of the judgments denounced, must have come with overwhelming force on the heart of so pious a prince.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The words of the book of the law, </span> i. e. the dreadful comminations against them for the sins still reigning among the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> Did Josiah never see and read a copy of this book before this time?

It was not, however, a wholly new thing; rather, he accepted it as the recovery of a thing that was known to have been lost, and was now happily found. And in accepting it he regarded it as authoritative. It was not to him "a book of Law" (Ewald), but "the book of <span class="accented">the</span> Law." We can well imagine that, although the book may have been lost early in Manasseh's reign, yet echoes of it had lingered on <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the liturgies of the Jehovistic worship; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the teachings of the prophets; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in the traditional teaching of religious families; so that the pious ear recognized its phrases as familiar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is also probable that there were external tokens about the book indicative of its character, which caused its ready acceptance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Repairing of the temple, and discovery of the book of the law (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8-18</a>). - When Josiah sent Shaphan the secretary of state (&#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>) into the temple, in the eighteenth year of his reign, with instructions to Hilkiah the high priest to pay to the builders the money which had been collected from the people for repairing the temple by the Levites who kept the door, Hilkiah said to Shaphan, "I have found the book of the law." <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3-8</a> form a long period. The apodosis to &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, "it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah-the king had sent Shaphan," etc., does not follow till <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a> : "that Hilkiah said," etc. The principal fact which the historian wished to relate, was the discovery of the book of the law; and the repairing of the temple is simply mentioned because it was when Shaphan was sent to Hilkiah about the payment of the money to the builders that the high priest informed the king's secretary of state of the discovery of the book of the law in the temple, and handed it over to him to take to the king. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>, forms the commencement to the minor clauses inserted within the principal clause, and subordinate to it: "the king had sent Shaphan," etc. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>, the king had deputed not only Shaphan the state-secretary, but also Maaseiah the governor of the city and Joach the chancellor, because the repairing of the temple was not a private affair of the king and the high priest, but concerned the city generally, and indeed the whole kingdom. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-5.htm">2 Kings 22:5</a> there follows the charge given by the king to Shaphan: "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may make up the money, ... and hand it over to the workmen appointed over the house of Jehovah," etc. &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, Hiphil, signifies to finish or set right, i.e., not pay out (Ges., Dietr.), but make it up for the purpose of paying out, namely, collect it from the door-keepers, count it, and bind it up in bags (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-11.htm">2 Kings 12:11</a>). &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is therefore quite appropriate here, and there is no alteration of the text required. The door-keepers had probably put the money in a chest placed at the entrance, as was the case at the repairing of the temple in the time of Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-10.htm">2 Kings 12:10</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-5.htm">2 Kings 22:5</a> the Keri &#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is a bad alteration of the Chethb &#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;, "and give (it) into the hand," which is perfectly correct. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; might denote both the masters and the workmen (builders), and is therefore defined more precisely first of all by &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, "who had the oversight at the house of Jehovah," i.e., the masters or inspectors of the building, and secondly by &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, who were (occupied) at the house of Jehovah, whilst in the Chronicles it is explained by &#1497; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;.
