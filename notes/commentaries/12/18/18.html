What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When they had called to the king - The ambassadors summoned Hezekiah, as if their rank were equal to his.

There God, by His prophet, calls him ‘my servant Eliakim’ and declares that ‘he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah’ and that ‘the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder’. The security of all things in his time is used by the prophet to prefigure a period of great blessing and peace. The office he held was a very dignified one, the highest under the king. It was held by Ahishar in Solomon’s days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm" title="And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.">1 Kings 4:6</a>) and by Azrikam in the days of Ahaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-7.htm" title="And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.">2 Chronicles 28:7</a>), and the Hebrew word there employed to describe it (<span class="ital">nagid</span>) is one used of great rulers and princes, and marks the high position of the holder.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Shebna</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">Shebnah</span>] <span class="ital">the scribe</span>] The orthography of the name is varied in this chapter. In verse 37 it is written Shebna, but here and in 26 ‘Shebnah’. The R.V. in each case follows the Hebrew. This Shebnah had originally held the office which was at this time Eliakim’s (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/22-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get you to this treasurer, even to Shebna, which is over the house, and say,...">Isaiah 22:15-19</a>) but had been put down because of his luxury and also because he was a favourer of the alliance with Egypt. This latter policy was always opposed by the prophets, and it was perhaps by Isaiah’s influence that Shebnah had been reduced to the lower post of royal secretary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Joah the son of Asaph the recorder</span>] Joah is only mentioned in this narrative and the parallel chapter in Isaiah. His office was that of ‘chronicler’, so that he was a necessary member of the deputation sent to confer with the Assyrian envoys. Thus a faithful statement would be put on record of all that took place.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they had called to the king</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, when they had announced that they had a message to deliver to the king - there came out to them; by Hezekiah's order, doubtless.
