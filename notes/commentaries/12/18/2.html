Some others did that which was right, but not like David. Let us not suppose that when times and men are bad, they must needs grow worse and worse; that does not follow: after many bad kings, God raised one up like David himself. The brazen serpent had been carefully preserved, as a memorial of God's goodness to their fathers in the wilderness; but it was idle and wicked to burn incense to it. All helps to devotion, not warranted by the word of God, interrupt the exercise of faith; they always lead to superstition and other dangerous evils. Human nature perverts every thing of this kind. True faith needs not such aids; the word of God, daily thought upon and prayed over, is all the outward help we need.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Twenty and five years old was he - This statement, combined with that of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-2.htm">2 Kings 16:2</a>, would make it necessary that his father Ahaz should have married at the age of 10, and have had a child born to him when he was 11 years of age. This is not impossible; but its improbability is so great, that most commentators suggest a corruption in some of the numbers.<p>The Zachariah here mentioned was perhaps one of the "faithful witnesses" of Isaiah Isa 8:2.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 18<p>2Ki 18:1-3. Hezekiah's Good Reign.<p>1, 2. Hezekiah &#8230; began to reign. Twenty and five years old&#8212;According to this statement (compare 2Ki 16:2), he must have been born when his father Ahaz was no more than eleven years old. Paternity at an age so early is not unprecedented in the warm climates of the south, where the human frame is matured sooner than in our northern regions. But the case admits of solution in a different way. It was customary for the later kings of Israel to assume their son and heir into partnership in the government during their lives; and as Hezekiah began to reign in the third year of Hoshea (2Ki 18:1), and Hoshea in the twelfth year of Ahaz (2Ki 17:1), it is evident that Hezekiah began to reign in the fourteenth year of Ahaz his father, and so reigned two or three years before his father's death. So that, at the beginning of his reign in conjunction with his father, he might be only twenty-two or twenty-three, and Ahaz a few years older than the common calculation makes him. Or the case may be solved thus: As the ancient writers, in the computation of time, take notice of the year they mention, whether finished or newly begun, so Ahaz might be near twenty-one years old at the beginning of his reign, and near seventeen years older at his death; while, on the other hand, Hezekiah, when he began to reign, might be just entering into his twenty-fifth year, and so Ahaz would be near fourteen years old when his son Hezekiah was born&#8212;no uncommon age for a young man to become a father in southern latitudes [Patrick].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign.</span> How is this credible?

There are some like instances mentioned by credible authors; which these very men will not deny, who are so ready to quarrel with the Holy Scriptures for such matters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. This being the confessed custom of sacred and other writers, in the numbering of years, sometimes to omit, and sometimes to add, those which are imperfect or unfinished; and so Ahaz might be near one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and near seventeen years older when he died. And on the other side, Hezekiah, when he began to reign, might be only four and twenty years old complete, and but entered into his five and twentieth year. And thus Ahaz might be between thirteen and fourteen years old when he got Hezekiah; which is not at all strange, especially in that nation, to which God had promised a singular degree of fruitfulness, and in that house of David, to which God had made so many and such great promises. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. It is not certain that Ahaz lived only thirty six years; for those sixteen years which he reigned, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-2.htm" title="And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.">2 Kings 17:2</a></span>, may be computed, not from the first beginning of his reign, when he reigned with his father, (of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm" title="And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.">2 Kings 15:30</a>"</span>,) which was at the twentieth year of his age, but from the beginning of his reign alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Some affirm that Hezekiah was not the natural, but only the legal son and successor of Ahaz; for the name of son is given in Scripture to such persons; as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-16.htm" title="And the sons of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son, Zedekiah his son.">1 Chronicles 3:16</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2 Kings 24:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Write you this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.">Jeremiah 22:30</a></span>; and to adopted sons, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-21.htm" title="And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.">Acts 7:21</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-24.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;">Hebrews 11:24</a></span>; and to sons-in-law, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David?

Any of these solutions are far more credible to any man of common prudence, than that these sacred books, whose Divine original hath been so fully evidenced both by God and men, are but the fictions and contrivances of a base impostor. And if none of these solutions were sufficient, it is absurd to conclude that a true resolution cannot be found because it is not yet found; because it is manifest, that many difficulties, both in Scripture and in the arts, which were formerly judged insoluble, have been cleared in later times; and therefore we may justly expect the resolution of other difficulties, which may be thought not yet fully explained. <span class="ital">Abi</span>, or <span class="ital">Abijah</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-1.htm" title="Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem.

Now as Ahaz his father began to reign at twenty, and reigned sixteen, he must die at thirty six; so that this son of his must be born to him when at eleven years of age, for only so many years there be between twenty five and thirty six, which may seem wonderful; but, as Grotius observes, Hezekiah had now entered into the twenty fifth year, and he might be just turned of twenty four, and so his father might be twelve years of age at his birth: besides, as it is usual for the divine historian to take away or add the incomplete years of kings, Ahaz might be near twenty one when he began to reign, and might reign almost seventeen, which makes the age of Ahaz to be about thirty eight; and Hezekiah being but little more than twenty four, at his death there were thirteen or near fourteen years difference in their age, and which was an age that need not be thought incredible for begetting of children. Bochart (f) and others (g) have given many instances of children begotten by persons under that age, even at ten years of age (h): four years after his birth, the famous city of Rome began to be founded (i), A. M. 3256, and before Christ 748, as commonly received, though it is highly probable it was of a more early date; according to Dionysius Halicarnassensis, it was founded in the first year of the seventh Olympaid, in the times of Ahaz, A. M. 3118 (k): <p>and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; so that he reigned twenty three years or more after the captivity of the ten tribes: <p>his mother's name also was Abi the daughter of Zachariah; perhaps the daughter of the same that was taken by Isaiah for a witness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a> who very probably was a very good woman, and took care to give her son a religious education, though he had so wicked a father. <p>(f) Ep.

"Unto this day they do after the former customs." &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; can only be the religious usages and ordinances which were introduced at the settlement of the new inhabitants, and which are described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-28.htm">2 Kings 17:28-33</a>. The prophetic historian observes still further, that "they fear not Jehovah, and do not according to their statutes and their rights, nor according to the law and commandment which the Lord had laid down for the sons of Jacob, to whom He gave the name of Israel" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>), i.e., according to the Mosaic law. &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1501; "their statutes and their right," stands in antithesis to &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; which Jehovah gave to the children of Israel. If, then, the clause, "they do not according to their statutes and their right," is not to contain a glaring contradiction to the previous assertion, "unto this day they do after their first (former) rights," we must understand by &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1501; &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; the statutes and the right of the ten tribes, i.e., the worship of Jehovah under the symbols of the calves, and must explain the inexactness of the expression "their statutes and their right" from the fact that the historian was thinking of the Israelites who had been left behind in the land, or of the remnant of the Israelitish population that had become mixed up with the heathen settlers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-19.htm">2 Kings 23:19-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>). The meaning of the verse is therefore evidently the following: The inhabitants of Samaria retain to this day the cultus composed of the worship of idols and of Jehovah under the form of an image, and do not worship Jehovah either after the manner of the ten tribes or according to the precepts of the Mosaic law. Their worship is an amalgamation of the Jehovah image-worship and of heathen idolatry (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-41.htm">2 Kings 17:41</a>). - To indicate the character of this worship still more clearly, and hold it up as a complete breach of the covenant and as utter apostasy from Jehovah, the historian describes still more fully, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-35.htm">2 Kings 17:35-39</a>, how earnestly and emphatically the people of Israel had been prohibited from worshipping other gods, and urged to worship Jehovah alone, who had redeemed Israel out of Egypt and exalted it into His own nation.
