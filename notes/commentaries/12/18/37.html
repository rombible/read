What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arpad was situated somewhere in southern Syria; but it is impossible to fix its exact position.

They were blasphemies, no doubt, arising from "invincible ignorance," and not intended as insults to the one Almighty Being who rules the earth, of whose existence Rabshakeh had probably no conception; but they struck on Jewish ears as insults to Jehovah, and therefore as dreadful and horrible (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And told him the words of Rabshakeh</span>; reported to him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as nearly as they could, all that Rabshakeh had said. The three envoys would supplement, and perhaps correct, one another; and Hezekiah would have conveyed to him a full and, on the whole, exact account of the message sent to him through Rabshakeh by the Assyrian king, and of Rabshakeh's method of enforcing it. The crisis of Hezekiah's life was reached. As he acted under it would be fixed his own fate, his character in the judgment of all future time, and the fate of his own country. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Make peace with me and come out to me (sc., out of your walls, i.e., surrender to me), and ye shall eat every one his vine, ... till I come and bring you into a land like your own land..." &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; is used here to signify peace as the concentration of weal and blessing. The imperative &#1493;&#1506;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; expresses the consequence of what goes before (vid., Ewald, 347, b.). To eat his vine and fig-tree and to drink the water of his well is a figure denoting the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of his own possession (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a>). Even in the event of their yielding, the Assyrian would transport the Jewish people into another land, according to the standing custom of Asiatic conquerors in ancient times (for proofs see Hengstenberg, De rebus Tyriis, pp. 51, 52). To make the people contented with this thought, the boaster promised that the king of Assyria would carry them into a land which was quite as fruitful and glorious as the land of Canaan. The description of it as a land with corn and new wine, etc., recalls the picture of the land of Canaan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>. &#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1512; &#1494;&#1497;&#1514; is the olive-tree which yields good oil, in distinction from the wild olive-tree. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;: and ye shall live and not die, i.e., no harm shall befall you from me (Thenius).
