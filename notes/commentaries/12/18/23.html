What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The phrase translated "give pledges," or "hostages" (margin) may perhaps be best understood as meaning "make an agreement." If you will "bind yourself to find the riders" (i. e., trained horsemen), we will "bind ourselves to furnish the horses." The suggestion implied that in all Judaea there were not 2000 men accustomed to serve as cavalry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Rab-shakeh said&#8212;The insolent tone he assumed appears surprising. But this boasting [2Ki 18:19-25], both as to matter and manner, his highly colored picture of his master's powers and resources, and the impossibility of Hezekiah making any effective resistance, heightened by all the arguments and figures which an Oriental imagination could suggest, has been paralleled in all, except the blasphemy, by other messages of defiance sent on similar occasions in the history of the East.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Give pledges to my lord, </span> i.e. give him hostages to secure him from thy future rebellion, and he will depart from thee.

The change conforms to verses 24 and 27 below. Having ridiculed any trust in Egypt, and expressed his opinion that Hezekiah could not expect help from Jehovah, after demolishing all the altars in the land, Rab-shakeh comes to his third argument. This is, ‘you have no forces to resist us’. He puts this into the form of a taunt. The verb rendered ‘give pledges’, has in its simpler voice, the sense of ‘mortgaging’ or ‘giving something in pledge’. In the present verse it appears to mean ‘pledge yourself’, ‘put yourself under some penalty’. And so the taunt is equivalent to saying: ‘You dare not undertake to find two thousand riders, if I offer you the horses for them. If you dare, then do it. The horses are ready; I challenge you to provide the men’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will deliver</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">give</span>. The verb is the one usually rendered ‘give’, and the insult is made the greater by this proud way of expressing superiority.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the King of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</span> "Pledge thyself," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to find the men, and I will pledge myself to find the horses." It is a strong expression of contempt for the military power of the Jews. They have not only no trained cavalry, but, were any one to furnish them with two thousand horses, they could not find the men to ride them. The Jewish army does, in fact, appear to have consisted of infantry and chariots only. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For though Sennacherib did indeed take the money, he did not depart, as he had no doubt promised, but, emboldened still further by this submissiveness, sent a detachment of his army against Jerusalem, and summoned Hezekiah to surrender the capital. "He sent Tartan, Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh." Rabshakeh only is mentioned in Isaiah, as the chief speaker in the negotiations which follow, although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-6.htm">Isaiah 37:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a> allusion is evidently made to the other two. Tartan had no doubt the chief command, since he is not only mentioned first here, but conducted the siege of Ashdod, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>. The three names are probably only official names, or titles of the offices held by the persons mentioned. For &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; means princeps eunuchorum, and &#1512;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; chief cup-bearer. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is explained by Hitzig on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a> as derived from the Persian tr-tan, "high person or vertex of the body," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a> as "body-guard;" but this is hardly correct, as the other two titles are Semitic. These generals took up their station with their army "at the conduit of the upper pool, which ran by the road of the fuller's field," i.e., the conduit which flowed from the upper pool - according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>, the basin of the upper Gihon (Birket el Mamilla) - into the lower pool (Birket es Sultn: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>, this conduit was in existence as early as the time of Ahaz. The "end" of it is probably the locality in which the conduit began at the upper pool or Gihon, or where it first issued from it. This conduit which led from the upper Gihon into the lower, and which is called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a> "the outflow of the upper Gihon," Hezekiah stopped up, and conducted the water downwards, i.e., the underground, towards the west into the city of David; that is to say, he conducted the water of the upper Gihon, which had previously flowed along the western side of the city outside the wall into the lower Gihon and so away down the valley of Ben-hinnom, into the city itself by means of a subterranean channel,<p>(Note: We may get some idea of the works connected with this aqueduct from the description of the "sealed fountain" of the Solomon's pool at Ain Saleh in Tobler, Topogr. v. Jerus. ii. pp. 857ff., Dritte Wanderung.)<p>that he might retain this water for the use of the city in the event of a siege of Jerusalem, and keep it from the besiegers.<p>This water was probably collected in the cistern (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;) which Hezekiah made, i.e., order to be constructed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>), or the reservoir "between the two walls for the waters of the old pool," mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>, i.e., most probably the reservoir still existing at some distance to the east of the Joppa gate on the western side of the road which leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the so-called "pool of Hezekiah," which the natives call Birket el Hamman, "Bathing-pool," because it supplies a bath in the neighbourhood, or B. el Batrak, "Patriarch's pool" (see Robinson, Pal. i. p. 487, and Fresh Researches into the Topography of Jerusalem, pp. 111ff.), since this is still fed by a conduit from the Mamilla pool (see E. G. Schultz, Jerusalem, p. 31, and Tobler, Denkbltter, pp. 44ff.).<p>(Note: The identity of the &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, which Hezekiah constructed as a reservoir for the overflow of the upper Gihon that was conducted into the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>), with the present "pool of Hezekiah" is indeed very probable, but not quite certain. For in very recent times, on digging the foundation for the Evangelical church built on the northern slope of Zion, they lighted upon a large well-preserved arched channel, which was partly cut in the rock, and, where this was not the case, built in level layers and coated within with a hard cement about an inch thick and covered with large stones (Robinson, New Inquiries as to the Topography of Jerusalem, p. 113, and Bibl. Res. p. 318), and which might possibly be connected with the channel made by Hezekiah to conduct the water of the upper Gihon into the city, although this channel does not open into the pool of Hezekiah, and the walls, some remains of which are still preserved, may belong to a later age. The arguments adduced by Thenius in support of the assumption that the "lower" or "old pool" mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a> is different from the lower Gihon-pool, and to be sought for in the Tyropoeon, are inconclusive. It by no means follows from the expression, "which lies by the road of the fuller's field," i.e., by the road which runs past the fuller's field, that there was another upper pool in Jerusalem beside the upper pool (Gihon); but this additional clause simply serves to define more precisely the spot by the conduit mentioned where the Assyrian army took its stand; and it by no means follows from the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>, "a gathering of waters have ye made between the two walls for the waters of the old pool," that this gathering of waters was made in the Tyropoeon, and that this "old pool," as distinguished from the lower pool (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9</a>), was an upper pool, which was above the king's pool mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>. For even if &#1492;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1497;&#1503; occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>, in connection with a locality on the south-east side of the city, the Old Testament says nothing about two pools in the Tyropoeon at the south-east corner of Jerusalem, but simply mentions a fountain gate, which probably derived its name from the present fountain of the Virgin, and the king's pool, also called Shelach in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-14.htm">Nehemiah 2:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>, which was no doubt fed from that fountain like the present Siloam, and watered the royal gardens. (Compare Rob. Pal. i. pp. 565ff., and Bibl. Res. p. 189, and Tobler, Die Siloah-quelle u. der Oelberg, pp. 1ff.). The two walls, between which Hezekiah placed the reservoir, may very well be the northern wall of Zion and the one which surrounded the lower city (Acra) on the north-west, according to which the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a> would admirably suit the "pool of Hezekiah." Again, Hezekiah did not wait till the departure of Sennacherib before he built this conduit, which is also mentioned in Wis. 48:17, as Knobel supposes (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>), but he made it when he first invaded Judah, before the appearance of the Assyrian troops in front of Jerusalem, when he made the defensive preparations noticed at v. 14, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3-4</a>, compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-30.htm">2 Kings 18:30</a>, since the stopping up of the fountain outside the city, to withdraw the water from the Assyrians, is expressly mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a> among the measures of defence; and in the concluding notices concerning Hezekiah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>, there is also a brief allusion to this work, without any precise indication of the time when he had executed it.)</body></html>
