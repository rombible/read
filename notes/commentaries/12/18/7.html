Thus we have in him an instructive and encouraging example, teaching us that they who do God’s work with an eye to his glory, and with confidence in his strength, may expect to prosper in it: for great is the truth, and will prevail. <span class="ital">And he rebelled against the king of Assyria — </span>That is, he threw off that yoke of subjection to him to which his father had basely submitted, and re-assumed that full and independent sovereignty which God had settled in the house of David. This, though here called <span class="ital">rebelling against him, </span>was really no more than asserting the just rights of his crown. For his case differed much from that of Zedekiah, who is blamed for rebellion against the king of Babylon. Zedekiah had engaged himself by a solemn oath and covenant, which we do not read that Ahaz had done, much less had Hezekiah. Zedekiah had broke the covenant which himself had made; and God had actually given the dominion of the land and people to the king of Babylon, and commanded both Zedekiah and his subjects to submit to him. But God had not given any such dominion to the king of Assyria, nor had he commanded either Hezekiah or his people to be subject to him. And as to the word <span class="ital">rebel </span>here used, it means no more than to depart from that subjection which had been performed to another, which sometimes may be justly done, and certainly might in this case. Indeed, that Hezekiah did not sin in revolting from the king of Assyria seems evident, because God owned and assisted him in it, and did not at all reprove him for it in that message which he sent to him by Isaiah, nor afterward, though he did particularly reprove him for his vain-glory and ostentation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/32-25.htm" title="But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem....">2 Chronicles 32:25-26</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 Hezekiah was a true son of David. Some others did that which was right, but not like David. Let us not suppose that when times and men are bad, they must needs grow worse and worse; that does not follow: after many bad kings, God raised one up like David himself. The brazen serpent had been carefully preserved, as a memorial of God's goodness to their fathers in the wilderness; but it was idle and wicked to burn incense to it. All helps to devotion, not warranted by the word of God, interrupt the exercise of faith; they always lead to superstition and other dangerous evils. Human nature perverts every thing of this kind. True faith needs not such aids; the word of God, daily thought upon and prayed over, is all the outward help we need.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord was with him - This had been said of no king since David (marginal reference). The phrase is very emphatic. The general prosperity of Hezekiah is set forth at some length by the author of Chronicles <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27-29</a>. His great influence among the nations bordering on the northern kingdom, was the cause of the first expedition of Sennacherib against him, the Ekronites having expelled an Assyrian viceroy from their city, and delivered him to Hezekiah for safe keeping: an expedition which did not very long precede that of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>, which fell toward the close of Hezekiah's long reign. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8. he rebelled against the king of Assyria&#8212;that is, the yearly tribute his father had stipulated to pay, he, with imprudent haste, withdrew. Pursuing the policy of a truly theocratic sovereign, he was, through the divine blessing which rested on his government, raised to a position of great public and national strength. Shalmaneser had withdrawn from Palestine, being engaged perhaps in a war with Tyre, or probably he was dead. Assuming, consequently, that full independent sovereignty which God had settled on the house of David, he both shook off the Assyrian yoke, and, by an energetic movement against the Philistines, recovered from that people the territory which they had taken from his father Ahaz (2Ch 28:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He shook off that yoke of subjection and tribute to which his father had wickedly submitted, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.">2 Kings 16:7</a></span>, and reassumed that full and independent sovereignty which God had settled in the house of David, which Ahaz could not alienate further than for his own time. And Hezekiah’s case differs much from that of Zedekiah, who is blamed for rebellion against the king of Babylon, both because he had engaged himself to him by a solemn oath and covenant, which we do not read of Ahaz; and because he broke the covenant which he himself had made; and because God had actually given the dominion of his own land and people to the king of Babylon, and commanded both Zedekiah and his people to submit to him. And whereas Hezekiah is here said to <span class="ital">rebel</span>, that word implies only a defection from that subjection which had been professed and performed to another: which sometimes may be justly done, and sometimes may not; and therefore that word doth not necessarily prove this action to be a sin.

No doubt the terms between the two nations were meant to continue in the reigns of the successors of Ahaz and Tiglath-pileser. The revolt of Hezekiah seems to have been made regardless of these terms. For when Sennacherib comes to attack him, he feels he must admit (verse 14) that he has offended, ‘I have offended, return from me, that which thou puttest on me will I bear’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - And the Lord was with him. Of no other King of Judah or Israel is this said, except only of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a>). It was the promise made to Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), repeated to Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5, 7</a>), and by implication given in them to all those who would rule his people faithfully (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>). And he prospered whithersoever he went forth; rather, <span class="accented">in all his goings - in cunctis ad quae procedebat</span> (Vulgate). Hezekiah's prosperity is enlarged upon by the writer of Chronicles, who says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27-30</a>), "And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, add for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.... And Hezekiah prospered in all his works." Many brought presents to him to Jerusalem, and he was magnified in the sight of all the surrounding nations (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not.</span> Hezekiah's "rebellion" probably took place at the very commencement of his reign,  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, in the year that Shalmaneser ascended the throne. Most likely it consisted simply in his withholding his tribute, and neither going in person nor sending representatives to Nineveh, to congratulate the new monarch on his accession. This would be understood as an assertion of independence. That it was not at once resented must be ascribed to Shalmaneser's difficulties with Samaria and with Tyre, which were more pressing, as they lay nearer to Assyria. Before these were over, Sargon usurped the crown. There is reason to believe that he made at least one expedition against Hezekiah; but the date of it is uncertain. Rebellion met him on all sides, and had to be crushed near home before he could venture to deal with it on the remote outskirts of his empire. Meanwhile Hezekiah strengthened himself and built up a considerable power. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Length and character of Hezekiah's reign.<p>(Note: On comparing the account of Hezekiah's reign given in our books (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a>) with that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>, the different plans of these two historical works are at once apparent. The prophetic author of our books first of all describes quite briefly the character of the king's reign (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-1.htm">2 Kings 18:1-8</a>), and then gives an elaborate description of the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib and of his attempt to get Jerusalem into his power, together with the destruction of the proud Assyrian force and Sennacherib's hasty return to Nineveh and death (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>); and finally, he also gives a circumstantial account of Hezekiah's illness and recovery, and also of the arrival of the Babylonian embassy in Jerusalem, and of Hezekiah's conduct on that occasion (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20.htm">2 Kings 20</a>). The chronicler, on the other hand, has fixed his chief attention upon the religious reformation carried out by Hezekiah, and therefore first of all describes most elaborately the purification of the temple from all idolatrous abominations, the restoration of the Jehovah-cultus and the feast of passover, to which Hezekiah invited all the people, not only the subjects of his own kingdom, but the remnant of the ten tribes also (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-31</a>); and then simply gives in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/32.htm">2 Kings 32</a> the most summary account of the attack made by Sennacherib upon Jerusalem and the destruction of his army, of the sickness and recovery of Hezekiah, and of his great riches, the Babylonian embassy being touched upon in only the most casual manner. The historical character of the elaborate accounts given in the Chronicles of Hezekiah's reform of worship and his celebration of the passover, which Thenius follows De Wette and Gramberg in throwing doubt upon, has been most successfully defended by Bertheau as well as others. - On the disputed question, in what year of Hezekiah's reign the solemn passover instituted by him fell, see the thorough discussion of it by C. P. Caspari (Beitrr. z. Einleit. in d. B. Jesaia, pp. 109ff.), and our Commentary on the Chronicles, which has yet to appear.)<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-1.htm">2 Kings 18:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>. In the third year of Hoshea of Israel, Hezekiah became king over Judah, when he was twenty-five years old. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-10.htm">2 Kings 18:10</a>, the fourth and sixth years of Hezekiah corresponded to the seventh and ninth of Hoshea; consequently his first year apparently ran parallel to the fourth of Hoshea, so that Josephus (Ant. ix. 13, 1) represents him as having ascended the throne in the fourth year of Hoshea's reign. But there is no necessity for this alteration. If we assume that the commencement of his reign took place towards the close of the third year of Hoshea, the fourth and sixth years of his reign coincided for the most part with the sixth and ninth years of Hoshea's reign. The name &#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; or &#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>, etc.) is given in its complete form &#1497;&#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, "whom Jehovah strengthens," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29</a>ff. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; and &#1493;&#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-1.htm">Hosea 1:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-1.htm">Micah 1:1</a>.
