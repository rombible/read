Pursuing the policy of a truly theocratic sovereign, he was, through the divine blessing which rested on his government, raised to a position of great public and national strength. Shalmaneser had withdrawn from Palestine, being engaged perhaps in a war with Tyre, or probably he was dead. Assuming, consequently, that full independent sovereignty which God had settled on the house of David, he both shook off the Assyrian yoke, and, by an energetic movement against the Philistines, recovered from that people the territory which they had taken from his father Ahaz (2Ch 28:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At the end of three years, </span> to wit, of the siege, i.e. in the third year, as this phrase is used, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-28.htm" title="At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:">Deu 14:28</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-16.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelled among them.">Joshua 9:16</a>,17 Jer 34:14</span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And at the end of three years they took it,....

That the vowels for the plural form have been written by the Massoretes can only be the result of a long retained tradition. The history must have died out of their knowledge entirely, but the word had been read as ‘they took it’ from the earliest times, and in that form they recorded it when they added the vowels to make their reading clear to the eye. Notice has already been taken of the remarkable way in which the Biblical record, though containing no record that the commencement of the siege and its close were in different reigns, yet avoids here any mistake in the history by the use of the pronoun ‘they’. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2 Kings 17:6</a> above. The siege of Samaria lasted from b.c. 724 to b.c. 722 and the capture was among the earliest events of Sargon’s reign.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at the end of three years they took it.</span> The expression, "at the end of three years," does not show that the three years were complete. On the contrary, as the siege Began in Hezekiah's fourth year, probably in the spring, and was over in his sixth, say, by the autumn, the entire duration was not more than two years and a half. The plural verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bb;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;</span>, "they took it," is remarkable, since it would have seemed more natural to write <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span>, "he took it" - and so the LXX., the Vulgate, and the Syriac - but the writer seems to have known that Shalmaneser did not take it, but died during the siege, the capture falling into the first year of Sargon (see the 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 65, 66). <span class="cmt_word">Even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea King of Israel</span> (see the comment on ver. 9), <span class="cmt_word">Samaria was taken</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As ruler Hezekiah walked in the footsteps of his ancestor David.

The singular &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; is used in a collective sense  equals  &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). The only other idol that is specially mentioned is the brazen serpent which Moses made in the wilderness (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>), and which the people with their leaning to idolatry had turned in the course of time into an object of idolatrous worship. The words, "to this day were the children of Israel burning incense to it," do not mean that this took place without interruption from the time of Moses down to that of Hezekiah, but simply, that it occurred at intervals, and that the idolatry carried on with this idol lasted till the time of Hezekiah, namely, till this king broke in pieces the brazen serpent, because of the idolatry that was associated with it. For further remarks on the meaning of this symbol, see the Comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>. The people called (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, one called) this serpent &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, i.e., a brazen thing. This epithet does not involve anything contemptuous, as the earlier commentators supposed, nor the idea of "Brass-god" (Ewald).</body></html>
