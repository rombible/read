Pursuing the policy of a truly theocratic sovereign, he was, through the divine blessing which rested on his government, raised to a position of great public and national strength. Shalmaneser had withdrawn from Palestine, being engaged perhaps in a war with Tyre, or probably he was dead. Assuming, consequently, that full independent sovereignty which God had settled on the house of David, he both shook off the Assyrian yoke, and, by an energetic movement against the Philistines, recovered from that people the territory which they had taken from his father Ahaz (2Ch 28:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded:</span> they began with one sin, the worship of the calves; but from thence they were led by degrees into the violation of all the other commands; although indeed that one sin made them in some sort guilty of the breach of the whole law, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">Jam 2:10</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord,....

The people were for the most part carried away, and settled in various places in Assyria, and they never came again to their own land, which continued to be occupied by the settlers introduced by Shalmaneser. Of those who were removed, the most probable fate was that they became mixed up with the people of the various districts in which they were settled, and so their nationality was lost. Some of their descendants we can hardly doubt, joined themselves to their brethren of Judah in the later days when the two tribes also were carried captive by the same power. These would return when the captivity was at an end, and so we find notices in the later history of persons who were members of one or other of the ten tribes. That the number of the tribes was kept in mind we can see from the dedication service after the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-17.htm" title="And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.">Ezra 6:17</a>), where among the sacrifices offered are ‘twelve he-goats according to the number of the tribes of Israel’. In greater or less proportion each tribe must have been thought to be represented at this service. In the Apocryphal books we have mention of the same service in nearly similar words (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/7-8.htm" title="And twelve goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the number of the chief of the tribes of Israel.">1Es 7:8</a>). Tobit (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/1-1.htm" title="The book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asael, of the tribe of Nephthali;">Tob 1:1</a>) was of the tribe of Naphtali. In the book of Judith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-15.htm" title="And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?">2 Kings 6:15</a>) we read of Ozias the son of Micha of the tribe of Simeon, in St Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>) Anna the daughter of Phanuel is of the tribe of Asher, in Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm" title="To which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.">Acts 26:7</a>) the language of St Paul shews that members of the twelve tribes were believed to be existing among the Jews of Palestine and of the Dispersion; to which twelve tribes St James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a>) also addresses his Epistle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But on the strength of language such as is found in the 2nd book of Esdras (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_esdras/13-39.htm" title="And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;...">2Es 13:39-50</a>) where the writer speaks of the ten tribes as going forth into a country where mankind had never dwelt, and of their future restoration, various theories have from time to time been started about the discovery of the lost tribes. The words of Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> XI. 5, 2) have helped on such notions. He speaks of the Israelites, i.e. the ten tribes, as existing in his own day in countless myriads beyond the Euphrates. If this statement had been true we should most certainly have found some mention of the people in other writers, of which there is not the slightest trace. Isolated bodies of Jews have no doubt been discovered here and there in the east, but no such community as would answer to the notions, which prevailed early in the Christian era of a large host of Israelites existing in some remote country of the northeast. The latest development of this notion, viz., that the Anglo-Saxon race is identical with the ten tribes, is only the outcome of great ignorance both of history and language. But it does harm because the devout among unlearned persons often grasp at such an idea, and by their absurd clinging thereto bring ridicule upon the rest of their faith, and are also led away from a reasonable and earnest study of the word of God into fanciful interpretations whereby they strive to support their erroneous ideas.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them</span> (compare the expanded version of this statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>).
