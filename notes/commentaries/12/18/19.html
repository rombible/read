What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Rab-shakeh, the third in rank of the three Assyrian ambassadors, probably took the prominent part in the conference because he could speak <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a> Kings <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/18-26.htm">Hebrews 18:26</a>, whereas the Tartan and the Rabsaris could not do so.<p>The great king - This title of the monarchs of Assyria is found in use as early as 1120 B.C.

But this boasting [2Ki 18:19-25], both as to matter and manner, his highly colored picture of his master's powers and resources, and the impossibility of Hezekiah making any effective resistance, heightened by all the arguments and figures which an Oriental imagination could suggest, has been paralleled in all, except the blasphemy, by other messages of defiance sent on similar occasions in the history of the East.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem,....

His being spokesman made him appear to be the chief ambassador, and made Isaiah, in the parallel passage (36.), pass over in silence the other two. <span class="cmt_word">Speak ye now to Hezekiah.</span> It was a rude, almost an insulting commencement, to give Hezekiah no title - neither "the king," nor "King of Judah," nor even "your master," but to call him merely "Hezekiah." The same rudeness is persisted in throughout (vers. 22, 29, 30, 31, 32), and it is emphasized by the employment of some title or other, generally a lofty title, when Sennacherib is spoken cf. Sennacherib himself is less rude in his inscriptions (see the 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, line 45; 134, line 6; 136, lines 21, 15). <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the great king, the King of Assyria.</span> The "great king" - <span class="accented">sarru rabu</span> - was the ordinary title assumed by Assyrian monarchs. It passed from them to the Babylonians and the Persians. Sennacherib calls himself, on Bellino's cylinder," the great king, the powerful king, the King of Assyria, the king unrivalled, the pious monarch, the worshipper of the great gods, the protector of the just, the lover of the righteous, the noble warrior, the valiant hero, the first of all kings, the great punisher of unbelievers" (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 25). <span class="cmt_word">What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</span> We may assume that Hezekiah had, at the beginning of the year, withheld his tribute. He had certainly not gone out to meet the "great king" as he approached his territories, to do homage, and place the forces of Judah at his disposal. On the contrary, he had taken up an attitude of hostility. He had fortified his capital (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-2.htm">2 Chronicles 32:2-5</a>); he had collected arms and soldiers, and had shut himself up in Jerusalem, having made every preparation for a siege. Sennacherib inquires why he has dared to do all this - on what strength does he rely? What is the ground of his confidence? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sennacherib invades Judah and threatens Jerusalem.<p>(Note: We have a parallel and elaborate account of this campaign of Sennacherib and his defeat (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-19:37</a>), and also of Hezekiah's sickness and recovery and the arrival of the Babylonian embassy in Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1-19</a>), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36-39</a>, and a brief extract, with certain not unimportant supplements, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32.htm">2 Chronicles 32</a>.

Brandis uber den histor. Gewinn aus der Entzifferung der assyr. Inschriften, pp. 103ff., and M. v. Niebuhr, Gesch.

He took all the fortified cities in Judah (&#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, with the masculine suffix instead of the feminine: cf. Ewald, 184, c.). The &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, all, is not to be pressed; for, beside the strongly fortified capital Jerusalem, he had not yet taken the fortified cities of Lachish and Libnah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>) at the time, when, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>., he sent a division of his army against Jerusalem, and summoned Hezekiah to surrender that city. According to Herodotus (l.c.), the real object of his campaign was Egypt, which is also apparent from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-24.htm">2 Kings 19:24</a>, and is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>; for which reason Tirhaka marched against him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>; cf.
