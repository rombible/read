We may also see a contrast between the utter overthrow of the stronger kingdom and the deliverance of its smaller and weaker neighbour, because Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-5.htm" title="He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.">2Kings 18:5</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:9-16 The descent Sennacherib made upon Judah, was a great calamity to that kingdom, by which God would try the faith of Hezekiah, and chastise the people.

Pursuing the policy of a truly theocratic sovereign, he was, through the divine blessing which rested on his government, raised to a position of great public and national strength. Shalmaneser had withdrawn from Palestine, being engaged perhaps in a war with Tyre, or probably he was dead. Assuming, consequently, that full independent sovereignty which God had settled on the house of David, he both shook off the Assyrian yoke, and, by an energetic movement against the Philistines, recovered from that people the territory which they had taken from his father Ahaz (2Ch 28:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The seventh year of Hoshea; </span> the seventh of those nine years expressed <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-1.htm" title="In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.">2 Kings 17:1</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah,....

In contrast with Hezekiah's piety and consequent prosperity, the author places the disobedience (ver. 12) and consequent extinction of the sister kingdom (vers. 9-11), which Belonged to Hezekiah's earlier years, and was an event of the greatest importance to him, since it made his dominions conterminous with those of Assyria, and exposed his northern frontier to attack at any moment from the Assyrian forces. According to all probable human calculation, the fall of Samaria should have been followed <span class="accented">at once</span> by an attack on Judaea; and but for the change of dynasty, and troubles on all sides which ensued thereupon, this would naturally have taken place. As it was, Judaea was allowed a Breathing-space, during which she strengthened her power in Philistia (see the comment on the preceding verse), and otherwise prepared herself to resist attack (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8-11</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah King of Israel.</span> Hezekiah Began to reign before Hoshea had completed his third year (ver. 1).

He removed the high places and the other objects of idolatrous worship, trusted in Jehovah, and adhered firmly to Him without wavering; therefore the Lord made all his undertakings prosper. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;, and &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>) embrace all the objects of idolatrous worship, which had been introduced into Jerusalem and Judah in the reigns of the former kings, and more especially in that of Ahaz. The singular &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; is used in a collective sense  equals  &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). The only other idol that is specially mentioned is the brazen serpent which Moses made in the wilderness (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>), and which the people with their leaning to idolatry had turned in the course of time into an object of idolatrous worship. The words, "to this day were the children of Israel burning incense to it," do not mean that this took place without interruption from the time of Moses down to that of Hezekiah, but simply, that it occurred at intervals, and that the idolatry carried on with this idol lasted till the time of Hezekiah, namely, till this king broke in pieces the brazen serpent, because of the idolatry that was associated with it. For further remarks on the meaning of this symbol, see the Comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>. The people called (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, one called) this serpent &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, i.e., a brazen thing. This epithet does not involve anything contemptuous, as the earlier commentators supposed, nor the idea of "Brass-god" (Ewald).</body></html>
