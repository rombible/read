The forgotten or ignored wrongs of generations come forth from oblivion and cry for vengeance. It is a poetical description, but it is not fiction. The righteous blood shed does fall upon the world in retribution: the laws of God avenge themselves, though the victims do not live to behold the reward of the ungodly.

He saw the souls of the martyrs under the altar; at the foot of the altar in heaven, at the feet of Christ. Persecutors can only kill the body; after that there is no more they can do; the soul lives. God has provided a good place in the better world, for those who are faithful unto death. It is not their own death, but the sacrifice of Christ, that gives them entrance into heaven. The cause in which they suffered, was for the word of God; the best any man can lay down his life for; faith in God's word, and the unshaken confession of that faith. They commit their cause to Him to whom vengeance belongs. The Lord is the comforter of his afflicted servants, and precious is their blood in his sight. As the measure of the sin of persecutors is filling up, so is the number of the persecuted, martyred servants of Christ. When this is fulfilled, God will send tribulation to those who trouble them, and unbroken happiness and rest to those that are troubled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when he had opened the fifth seal - notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1</a>.<p>I saw under the altar - The four living creatures are no longer heard as in the opening of the first four seals. No reason is given for the change in the manner of the representation; and none can be assigned, unless it be, that having represented each one of the four living creatures in their turn as calling attention to the remarkable events about to occur, there seemed to be no necessity or propriety in introducing them again. In itself considered, it cannot be supposed that they would be any less interested in the events about to be disclosed than they were in those which preceded. This seal pertains to martyrs - at the former successively did to a time of prosperity and triumph; to discord and bloodshed; to oppressive taxation; to war, famine, and pestilence. In the series of woes, it was natural and proper that there should be a vision of martyrs, if it was intended that the successive seals should refer to coming and important periods of the world; and accordingly we have here a striking representation of the martyrs crying to God to interpose in their behalf and to avenge their blood. The points which require elucidation are:<p>(a) their position - under the altar;<p>(b) their invocation - or their prayer that they might be avenged;<p>(c) the clothing of them with robes; and,<p>(d) the command to wait patiently a little time.<p>(1) the position of the martyrs - "under the altar." There were in the temple at Jerusalem two altars - the altar of burnt sacrifices, and the altar of incense. The altar here referred to was probably the former. This stood in front of the temple, and it was on this that the daily sacrifice was made. Compare the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>. We are to remember, however, that the temple and the altar were both destroyed before the time when this book was written, and this should, therefore, be regarded merely as a vision. John saw these souls as if they were collected under the altar - the place where the sacrifice for sin was made - offering their supplications. Why they are represented as being there is not so apparent; but probably two suggestions will explain this:<p>(a) The altar was the place where sin was expiated, and it was natural to represent these redeemed martyrs as seeking refuge there; and<p>(b) it was usual to offer prayers and supplications at the altar, in connection with the sacrifice made for sin, and on the ground of that sacrifice.<p>The idea is, that they who were suffering persecution would naturally seek a refuge in the place where expiation was made for sin, and where prayer was appropriately offered. The language here is such as a Hebrew would naturally use; the idea is appropriate to anyone who believes in the atonement, and who supposes that that is the appropriate refuge for those who are in trouble. But while the language here is such as a Hebrew would use, and while the reference in the language is to the altar of Burnt sacrifice, the scene should be regarded as undoubtedly laid in heaven - the temple where God resides. The whole representation is that of fleeing to the atonement, and pleading with God in connection with the sacrifice for sin.<p>The souls of them that were slain - That had been put to death by persecution. This is one of the incidental proofs in the Bible that the soul does not cease to exist at death, and also that it does not cease to be conscious, or does not sleep until the resurrection. These souls of the martyrs are represented as still in existence; as remembering what had occurred on the earth; as interested in what was now taking place; as engaged in prayer; and as manifesting earnest desires for the divine interposition to avenge the wrongs which they had suffered.<p>For the word of God - On account of the word or truth of God. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>.<p>And for the testimony which they held - On account of their testimony to the truth, or being faithful witnesses of the truth of Jesus Christ.

How long&#8212;Greek, "Until when?" As in the parable the woman (symbol of the Church) cries day and night to the unjust judge for justice against her adversary who is always oppressing her (compare below, Re 12:10); so the elect (not only on earth, but under Christ's covering, and in His presence in Paradise) cry day and night to God, who will assuredly, in His own time, avenge His and their cause, "though He bear long with them." These passages need not be restricted to some particular martyrdoms, but have been, and are receiving, and shall receive partial fulfilments, until their last exhaustive fulfilment before Christ's coming. So as to the other events foretold here. The glory even of those in Paradise will only be complete when Christ's and the Church's foes are cast out, and the earth will become Christ's kingdom at His coming to raise the sleeping saints.<p>Lord&#8212;Greek, "Master"; implying that He has them and their foes and all His creatures as absolutely at His disposal, as a master has his slaves; hence, in Re 6:11, "fellow servants," or fellow slaves follows.<p>holy&#8212;Greek, "the Holy one."<p>avenge&#8212;"exact vengeance for our blood."<p>on&#8212;Greek, "from them."<p>that dwell on the earth&#8212;the ungodly, of earth, earthly, as distinguished from the Church, whose home and heart are even now in heavenly places.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And they cried with a loud voice; </span> their blood cried, or their souls cried to God, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">saying, How long, O Lord, holy; </span> and therefore thou canst not abide iniquity, and of all iniquity canst least abide innocent blood, which is the blood of thy saints, whose blood is precious in thy sight. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And true; </span> and who art true to thy word of threatenings against blood thirsty men, and to thy promises for the deliverance of thy people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dost thou net judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</span> Dost thou not judge our cause, and avenge us, who have committed vengeance to thee, not daring to avenge ourselves upon wicked men, who dwelling upon the earth are seen, and their practices known to and by thee, and are under thy power, so as thou canst at pleasure do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they cried with a loud voice,....

Like Clem. Rom., John is fond of <span class="greekheb">δεσπότης</span> as implying the divine might and majesty (3Ma 3:29; 3Ma 5:28). This severe and awe-inspiring conception (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Philo, <span class="ital">quis rer. div. haer.</span> 6) means that God will vindicate his holiness, which had been outraged by the murder of the <span class="greekheb">δοῦλοι</span> for whom he is responsible. In contemporary pagan religions throughout Asia Minor, the punishment of wrong-doing is often conceived in the same way, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, as the answer to the sufferer’s appeal (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Introd. § 2), not simply as a spontaneous act of divine retribution. “How long wilt thou refrain from charging and avenging our blood upon (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-13.htm" title="As said the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked: but my hand shall not be on you.">1 Samuel 24:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm" title="As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you, O God.">Psalm 42:1</a>) those who dwell on the earth” (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, pagans)? The bleeding heart of primitive Christendom stands up and cries, “I have suffered”. For <span class="greekheb">ἐκδικεῖν αἷμα</span> <span class="ital">cf.</span> Dittenberger’s <span class="ital">Sylloge Inscript. Graec.</span> 816 (1 cent.

In that case we should have expected some allusion to the vicarious, atoning power of the martyrs’ death (<span class="ital">R. J.</span> 181). The prophet evidently anticipated further persecution, since he wrote on the verge of the end precipitated by the Domitianic policy (<span class="ital">cf.</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>). Such persecution follows natural disturbances, as in the synoptic apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-6.htm" title="And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet....">Matthew 24:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm" title="For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.">Matthew 24:21</a> f.), but the outline of the fifth seal is taken from Enoch, where (xlvii.) the prayer and blood of the martyred saints “rise from the earth before the Lord of Spirits,” while the angels rejoice that such blood has not been shed in vain. In En. xcvii. 3–5 the prayer of the righteous for vengeance overtakes their persecutors on the day of judgment with woeful issues (xxix. 3, 16). “Persist in your cry for judgment, and it shall appear unto you; for all your tribulation will be visited on the rulers, and on all their helpers, and on those who plundered you” (civ. 3, <span class="ital">cf.</span> xxii. 6, 7, where Abel’s pirit complains of Cain).—<span class="greekheb">κατ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. always in Apocalypse opposed to the saints, almost as “the world” to “the pious” in modern phraseology. This usage is largely paralleled by that of the Noachic interpolations in Enoch (see Charles on xxxvii. 5), where the phrase has either unfavourable or neutral associations. <span class="greekheb">ἅγιος</span> here (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you.

Perhaps, as the usual word “Lord” in the N. T. and other Hellenistic writings stands for the Name Jehovah, so this is used where the <span class="ital">sense</span> “Lord” is really meant, i.e. it answers to the name <span class="ital">Adonai</span>, which the Jews pronounced instead of the Unutterable Name, and which Symeon and the Apostolic Church no doubt used in their thanksgivings. Their use of the word, especially in the latter instance, shews that it is no argument for these Martyrs being only Jews—as though it proved a servile rather than filial spirit, as some have imagined: at most, it only proves Jewish habits of expression, and it needs no proof that such prevail throughout this Book.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dost thou not … avenge</span>] It has been argued again from this, that the temper of the Martyrs’ souls is less than Christian.

As we meet with the germ of the thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-3.htm" title="LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?">Psalm 94:3</a>, so we have a developement of it, substantially identical with this, from the mouth of Christ Himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/18-2.htm" title="Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:...">Luke 18:2-8</a>. Faith looks on evil with a hatred like God’s own—shares God’s will that it shall not triumph, and trusts in God that it will not: but without sharing the depth of God’s counsels, Who knows best how and when to overthrow it. Therefore the Church on earth (the probable meaning of the Widow) and the Saints in heaven, cry alike to God to execute His own purpose, and bring the reign of evil to an end—and He does not yet, but He surely will.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they cried with a loud voice, saying;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. the souls cried.</span> Ebrard, Dusterdieck, Hengstenberg, make "the slain" nominative, in contradistinction to the "souls," which is both <span class="accented">unnecessary</span> and unnatural.

No doubt the souls waiting in Paradise are answered by "comfortable words," yet, not having lost their interest in earthly struggles, nor their longing for the triumphant vindication of God's glory, they cry, "How long?," not as needing the time to be shortened for their own sakes, for <span class="accented">they rest</span>, though not yet entered into the fulness of God's glory. O Lord, holy and true; <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">Master, the holy and true</span> (Revised Version).

This is the only instance of its occurrence in the Apocalypse. (On "true," see previous passages.) Deal thou not judge and avenge our blood. The cry is not a petition for personal revenge, but a request for the termination of those ills which for a time afflict man, and the termination of which must, by virtue of God's eternal justice, be accompanied by visible retribution on the wicked. (Cf. Bede, "Those souls which offered themselves a living sacrifice to God pray eternally for his coming to judgment, not from any vindictive feeling against their enemies, but in a spirit of zeal and love for God's glory and justice, mid for the coming of that day when sin, which is rebellion against him, will be destroyed, and their own bodies will be raised. And so in that prayer wherein Christ teaches us to forgive our enemies, we are also taught to <span class="accented">say</span>, 'Thy kingdom come.'") The passage has given rise to varying interpretations, which are thought to be more consonant with the spirit of the gospel. Thus I. Williams would understand the souls to represent only the Old Testament saints, especially as it is not explicitly said that they died for the witness of Jesus, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>.
