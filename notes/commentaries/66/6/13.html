The foundations of churches and states would be terribly shaken. Such bold figurative descriptions of great changes abound in the prophecies of Scripture; for these events are emblems, and declare the end of the world and the day of judgment. Dread and terror would seize on all sorts of men. Neither grandeur, riches, valour, nor strength, can support men at that time. They would be glad to be no more seen; yea, to have no longer any being. Though Christ be a Lamb, he can be angry, and the wrath of the Lamb is exceedingly dreadful; for if the Redeemer himself, who appeases the wrath of God, be our enemy, where shall we find a friend to plead for us? As men have their day of opportunity, and their seasons of grace, so God has his day of righteous wrath. It seems that the overthrow of the paganism of the Roman empire is here meant. The idolaters are described as hiding themselves in their dens and secret caves, and vainly seeking to escape ruin. In such a day, when the signs of the times show those who believe in God's word, that the King of kings is approaching, Christians are called to a decided course, and to a bold confession of Christ and his truth before their fellowmen. Whatever they may have to endure, the short contempt of man is to be borne, rather than that shame which is everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1</a>.<p>And, lo, there was a great earthquake - Before endeavoring to ascertain to what the sixth seal was designed to refer, it is proper, as in the previous cases, to furnish a particular explanation of the meaning of the symbols. All the symbols represented in the opening of this seal denote consternation, commotion, changes; but still they are all significant, and we are to suppose that something would occur corresponding with each one of them. It cannot be supposed that the things here described were represented on the part of the roll or volume that was now unfolded in any other way than that they were pictures, or that the whole was a species of panoramic representation made to pass before the eyes. Thus understood, it would not be difficult to represent each one of these things in a painting: as the heaving ground - the agitated forests - the trembling hills - the falling cities and houses - the sun blackened, and the moon turned to blood:<p>(a) The earthquake, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>; "There was a great earthquake." The word used here denotes a shaking or agitation of the earth. The effect, when violent, is to produce important changes - opening chasms in the earth; throwing down houses and temples; sinking hills, and elevating plains; causing ponds and lakes to dry up, or forming them where none existed; elevating the ocean from its bed, rending rocks, etc. As all that occurs in the opening of the other seals is symbolical, it is to be presumed that this is also, and that for the fulfillment of this we are not to look for a literal earthquake, but for such agitations and changes in the world as would be properly symbolized by this. The earthquake, as a symbol, would merely denote great agitations or overturnings on the earth. The particular character of those changes must be determined by other circumstances in the symbol that would limit and explain it.<p>There are, it is said, but three literal earthquakes referred to in the Scripture: that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; that in Uzziah's time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>; and what took place at the Saviour's death. All the rest are emblematical or symbolical-referring mostly to civil commotions and changes. Then in <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>; "Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land, and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts." That is, there would be great agitations in the world before he came. See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-28</a>. So also great changes and commotions are referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19-20</a>; "The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage." An earthquake, if there were no other circumstances limiting and explaining the symbol, would merely denote great agitation and commotion - as if states and empires were tumbling to ruin. As this is here a mere symbol, it is not necessary to look for a literal fulfillment, or to expect to find in history actual earthquakes to which this had reference, anymore than when it is said that "the heavens departed as a scroll" we are to expect that they will be literally rolled up; but if, in the course of history, earthquakes preceded remarkable political convulsions and revolutions, it would be proper to represent such events in this way.<p>(b) The darkening of the sun: "And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair." Sackcloth was a coarse black cloth, commonly, though not always, made of hair. It was used for sacks, for strainers, and for mourning garments; and as thus worn it was not an improper emblem of sadness and distress. The idea here is, that the sun put on a dark, dingy, doleful appearance, as if it were in mourning. The general image, then, in this emblem, is that of calamity - as if the very sun should put on the robes of mourning. We are by no means to suppose that this was literally to occur, but that some great calamity would happen, of which this would be an appropriate emblem. See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a> note; Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>; 1, 3; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>. What is the particular nature of the calamity is to be learned from other parts of the symbol.<p>(c) The discoloration of the moon: "And the moon became as blood." Red like blood - either from the smoke and vapor that usually precedes an earthquake, or as a mere emblem. This also would betoken calamity, and perhaps the symbol may be so far limited and modified by this as to denote war, for that would be most naturally suggested by the color - red. Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a> of this chapter. But any great calamity would be appropriately represented by this - as the change of the moon to such a color would be a natural emblem of distress.<p>(d) The falling of the stars, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a>; "And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth." This language is derived from the poetic idea that the sky seems to be a solid concave, in which the stars are set, and that when any convulsion takes place, that concave will be shaken, and the stars will be loosened and fall from their places. See this language explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. Sometimes the expanse above us is spoken of as a curtain that is spread out, and that may be rolled up; sometimes as a solid crystalline expanse in which the stars are fixed. According to either representation the stars are described as falling to the earth. If the expanse is rolled up, the stars, having nothing to support them, fall if violent tempests or concussions shake the heavens, the stars, loosened from their fixtures, fall to the earth. Stars, in the Scriptures, are symbols of princes and rulers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>); and the natural meaning of this symbol is, that there would be commotions which would unsettle princes, and bring them down from their thrones - like stars falling from the sky.<p>Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs - Mart., "green"; Greek, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  olunthous. This word properly denotes "winter-figs," or such as grow under the leaves, and do not ripen at the proper season, but hang upon the trees during the winter (Robinson, Lexicon). This fruit seldom matures, and easily falls off in the spring of the year (Stuart, in loco). A violent wind shaking a plantation of fig-trees would of course cast many such figs to the ground. The point of the comparison is, the ease with which the stars would seem to be shaken from their places, and hence, the ease with which, in these commotions, princes would be dethroned.<p>(e) The departing of the heavens, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>; "And the heaven departed as a scroll." That is, as a book or volume - &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  biblion - rolled up. The heavens are here described as spread out, and their passing away is represented by the idea that they might be rolled up, and thus disappear. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. This, too, is a symbol, and we are not to suppose that it will literally occur. Indeed it never can literally occur; and we are not, therefore, to look for the fulfillment of this in any physical fact that would correspond with what is here said. The plain meaning is, that there would be changes as if such an event would happen; that is, that revolutions would occur in the high places of the earth, and among those in power, as if the stars should fall, and the very heavens were swept away. This is the natural meaning of the symbol, and this accords with the usage of the language elsewhere.<p>(f) The removal of mountains and islands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>; "And every mountain and island were moved out of their places." This would denote convulsions in the political or moral world, as great as would occur in the physical world if the very mountains were removed and the islands should change their places. We are not to suppose that this would literally occur; but we should be authorized from this to expect that, in regard to those things which seemed to be permanent and fixed on an immov able basis, like mountains and islands, there would be violent and important changes. If thrones and dynasties long established were overthrown; if institutions that seemed to be fixed and per manent were abolished; if a new order of things should rise in the political world, the meaning of the symbol, so far as the language is concerned, would be fulfilled.<p>(g) The universal consternation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>; "And the kings of the earth, etc." The design of these verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>, in the varied language used, is evidently to denote universal consternation and alarm - as if the earth should be convulsed, and the stars should fall, and the heavens should pass away. This consternation would extend to all classes of people, and fill the world with alarm, as if the end of all things were coming.<p>The kings of the earth - Rulers - all who occupied thrones.<p>The great men - High officers of state.<p>And the rich men - Their wealth would not secure them from destruction, and they would be alarmed like others.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. stars &#8230; fell &#8230; as a fig tree casteth her &#8230; figs&#8212;(Isa 34:4; Na 3:12). The Church shall be then ripe for glorification, the Antichristian world for destruction, which shall be accompanied with mighty phenomena in nature. As to the stars falling to the earth, Scripture describes natural phenomena as they would appear to the spectator, not in the language of scientific accuracy; and yet, while thus adapting itself to ordinary men, it drops hints which show that it anticipates the discoveries of modern science.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is but another phrase signifying a great change: the whole verse is much the same with <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a></span>.

All the other inferior deities lost their esteem, worship, and honour; for the idol temples being now opened, the idols and statues were exposed to the common people, and were found to be stuffed with hay and straw, which brought them into great contempt (l). Moreover, as stars sometimes signify the ministers of the Gospel in the Christian church, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>, and sometimes the priests in the Jewish church, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>; so they may here likewise include the idolatrous priests among the Heathens, who were discharged and removed by Constantine, and had their posts and profits taken away from them; yea, Maximinus, an Heathen emperor, or tyrant, being beaten by Licinius, who was then Constantine's colleague, killed many of the priests and prophets of his gods, which were formerly had in great admiration by him, as deceivers and betrayers of him, by whose oracles he was animated to the war (m). And in like manner Licinius put to death the priests and prophets of the new idol at Antioch (n). <p>Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind; which figs being young and green, and not fixed, fall off easily, and in great numbers, when a blustering wind beats upon them; and so the rabble of Pagan deities, and idolatrous priests, were easily, and in great numbers, removed through the power of Constantine, which carried all before it. <p>(l) Sozomen, l. 2. c. 5.

The “untimely fig” is the fig which, having formed too late to ripen in the autumn, hangs through the winter, but almost always drops off before the sap begins to rise in spring, so as not to come to maturity. See Comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-19.htm" title="And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever.

Some have thus been led to find a particular application of this sentence.
