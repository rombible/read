The advent of the highest good does not work peace, but only because the hindrance is in man. Man’s resistance to good turns the gospel of peace into an occasion for the sword. So our Lord declares, “I came not to send peace, but a sword.” The reign of peace, the beating of swords into ploughshares, is not yet. The vision may help to fix the Christian position about war. It is to be expected; it is an evil, but often an inevitable evil. Those who take part in war are not condemned: those who occasion offences are. It is as much a mistake to condemn soldiering as a profession as it is to deny that Christianity aims at the suppression of war. She admits the soldier to be a soldier of Christ, even while she keeps before her the ideal age when nations shall learn war no more. We expect wars, even while we believe that the day will come when war will be reckoned as absurd as duelling is now. The vision says, “It must needs be that wars will come;” and war, even when roused by the passions of men, is a judgment of God, for God’s judgments are mostly formed out of man’s vices. The seal puts in pictorial form the warning of Christ that wars and rumours of wars would be heard of. How true the warning the after history shows—wars in the empire, wars among nations, controversies, and often fratricidal wars in the Church of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/6-3.htm" title="And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see....">Revelation 6:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">When he opened the second seal, I heard the second </span>living creature — Which was like an ox, and had his station toward the west; <span class="ital">say, Come and see </span>— As the former had done when the first seal was opened; <span class="ital">and there went out another horse that was red </span>— Seeming to betoken great slaughter and desolation by approaching wars: <span class="ital">and to him that sat thereon was given to take peace from the earth </span>— In the year 75, Vespasian had dedicated a temple to Peace: but after a time we hear no more of peace; all is full of war and bloodshed. According to Bishop Newton, this second period commences with Trajan, who came from the west, being a Spaniard by birth, and was the first foreigner who was elevated to the imperial throne. In his reign, and that of his successor, Adrian, there were horrid wars and slaughters, and especially between the rebellious Jews and Romans. Dion relates, that the Jews about Cyrene slew of the Romans and Greeks two hundred and twenty thousand men, with the most shocking circumstances of barbarity. In Egypt also, and in Cyprus, they committed the like barbarities, and there perished two hundred and forty thousand men more. But the Jews were subdued in their turn by the other generals and Lucius, sent against them by Trajan. Eusebius, writing of the same time, says, that the Jews, inflamed, as it were, by some violent and seditious spirit, in the first conflict gained a victory over the Gentiles, who, flying to Alexandria, took and killed the Jews in the city. The emperor sent Marius Turbo against them, with great forces by sea and land, who, in many battles, slew many myriads of the Jews. The emperor also, suspecting that they might make the like commotions in Mesopotamia, ordered Lucius Quietus to expel them out of the province, who, marching against them, slew a very great multitude of them there. Orosius, treating of the same time, says, that the Jews, with an incredible commotion, made wild, as it were, with rage, rose at once in different parts of the earth. For throughout all Libya they waged the fiercest wars against the inhabitants, and the country was almost desolated. Egypt also, Cyrene, and Thebais they disturbed with cruel seditions. But in Alexandria they were overcome in battle. In Mesopotamia also war was made upon the rebellious Jews by the command of the emperor. So that many thousands of them were destroyed with vast slaughter. They utterly destroyed Salamis, a city of Cyprus, having first murdered all the inhabitants. These things were transacted in the reign of Trajan; and in the reign of Adrian was their great rebellion, under their false Messiah Barchochab, and their final dispersion, after fifty of their strongest castles, and nine hundred and eighty-five of their best towns had been demolished, and after five hundred and eighty thousand men had been slain by the sword, besides an infinite number who had perished by famine and sickness, and other casualties; with great loss and slaughter too of the Romans, insomuch that the emperor forbore the usual salutations in his letters to the senate. Here was another illustrious triumph of Christ over his enemies; and the Jews and the Romans, both the persecutors of the Christians, were remarkably made the dreadful executioners of divine vengeance upon one another. The <span class="ital">great sword </span>and <span class="ital">red horse </span>are expressive emblems of this slaughtering and bloody period, and the proclamation for slaughter is fitly made by a creature like an ox, that is destined for slaughter. This period continued during the reigns of Trajan and his successors, by blood or adoption, about ninety-five years.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Christ, the Lamb, opens the first seal: observe what appeared. A rider on a white horse. By the going forth of this white horse, a time of peace, or the early progress of the Christian religion, seems to be intended; its going forth in purity, at the time when its heavenly Founder sent his apostles to teach all nations, adding, Lo! I am with you alway, even to the end of the world. The Divine religion goes out crowned, having the Divine favour resting upon it, armed spiritually against its foes, and destined to be victorious in the end. On opening the second seal, a red horse appeared; this signifies desolating judgments. The sword of war and persecution is a dreadful judgment; it takes away peace from the earth, one of the greatest blessings; and men who should love one another, and help one another, are set upon killing one another. Such scenes also followed the pure age of early Christianity, when, neglectful of charity and the bond of peace, the Christian leaders, divided among themselves, appealed to the sword, and entangled themselves in guilt. On opening the third seal, a black horse appeared; a colour denoting mourning and woe, darkness and ignorance. He that sat on it had a yoke in his hand. Attempts were made to put a yoke of superstitious observances on the disciples. As the stream of Christianity flowed further from its pure fountain, it became more and more corrupt. During the progress of this black horse, the necessaries of life should be at excessive prices, and the more costly things should not be hurt. According to prophetic language, these articles signified that food of religious knowledge, by which the souls of men are sustained unto everlasting life; such we are invited to buy, Isa 55:1. But when the dark clouds of ignorance and superstition, denoted by the black horse, spread over the Christian world, the knowledge and practice of true religion became scarce. When a people loathe their spiritual food, God may justly deprive them of their daily bread. The famine of bread is a terrible judgment; but the famine of the word is more so. Upon opening the fourth seal, another horse appeared, of a pale colour. The rider was Death, the king of terrors. The attendants, or followers of this king of terrors, hell, a state of eternal misery to all who die in their sins; and in times of general destruction, multitudes go down unprepared into the pit. The period of the fourth seal is one of great slaughter and devastation, destroying whatever may tend to make life happy, making ravages on the spiritual lives of men. Thus the mystery of iniquity was completed, and its power extended both over the lives and consciences of men. The exact times of these four seals cannot be ascertained, for the changes were gradual. God gave them power, that is, those instruments of his anger, or those judgments: all public calamities are at his command; they only go forth when God sends them, and no further than he permits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when he had opened the second seal - So as to disclose another portion of the volume.

All that seems to be designed is, that as the living creatures are intended to be emblems of the providential government of God, it was proper to represent that government as concerned in the opening of each of these four seals, indicating important events among the nations.<p>Come and see - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. and see&#8212;omitted in the three oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, and Vulgate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The second seal; </span> the second of those seven seals with which the book, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm" title="And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.">Revelation 5:1</a></span>, was sealed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The second beast; </span> the beast <span class="bld">like a calf, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-7.htm" title="And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.">Revelation 4:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Come and see; </span> inviting John to attend. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he had opened the second seal,....

When the Lamb[2034] opens the second seal, John is again commanded, and this time by the second of the beings, to come; it is therefore presupposed, that after the vision of the first seal had ended, and the first image of a horseman had vanished, he had again withdrawn, and taken his original place.[2035] The form proceeding from the book of fate after the opening of the second seal (<span class="greekheb">ἐξῆλθεν</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm" title="And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.">Revelation 6:2</a>) is that of personified shedding of blood. This is so obviously indicated by the <span class="ital">red</span> color of the horse,[2036] whereby it was granted (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΔΌΘΗ</span></span></span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>) to take peace away from the earth with the effect of a slaughtering of one another by the dwellers upon earth,[2037] and by the corresponding emblem of a great sword which was given (<span class="greekheb">ἐδόθη</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm" title="And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.">Revelation 6:2</a>),[2038] that expositors are united concerning the essential significance of the vision.[2039] The more accurate determination of the intention of the threatening manifestation is given partly from the words <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς γῆς</span>, and partly from the connection of the whole, decided already in the first sight of a seal. As <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς γῆς</span> does not mean “from the land of Judaea, and the places in which there were Jews,”[2040] certainly the vision as a prophecy post <span class="ital">eventum</span> cannot refer to the Jewish war, and the rapine and strifes of factions which occurred during its continuance, especially in Jerusalem.[2041] Since, on the other hand, because of the connection of <span class="greekheb">λαβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς γῆς</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλους σφάξουσιν</span>, only the <span class="greekheb">κατοικοῦντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span>[2042] can be regarded as subject to <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλους σφάξ</span>., who kill <span class="ital">one another</span>, those massacred cannot be Christians, i.e., the discourse cannot be in reference to the persecutions of Christians; for then also, in reference to the combination of the first four seal-visions, it is entirely arbitrary to assert that the last three horsemen occupy a hostile position towards the first.[2043] Incorrect, therefore, are all expositions which in the second seal-vision find the persecution of Christians; as well those specially expounding it,[2044] as those holding it more or less in general.[2045] On the contrary, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-7.htm" title="For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places....">Matthew 24:7-8</a>, wars in the world are regarded as the first presage of the <span class="ital">parousia</span> of Christ, the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων</span>, so there appears here the personification of the shedding of blood, which is to occur on earth in consequence of the Lord’s approach for the glorious and victorious end. Even sanguinary war serves the Lord at his coming. Believers, too, are of course alarmed by the <span class="greekheb">πειρασμός</span> which is thus proclaimed by the second seal-vision;[2046] but their Lord not only preserves them, but at the signs of his coming they are to be the more confident in their hope, since their redemption approaches.[2047]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2034] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.">Revelation 6:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2035] Cf., also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-5.htm" title="And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see.
