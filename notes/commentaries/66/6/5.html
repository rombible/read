It is the emblem of scarcity: food is not weighed out thus in times of abundance. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:">Ezekiel 4:16</a>, “Behold I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and with care.”) The choenix (“measure” in English version) was the amount of food sufficient to support a man for a day. “A choenix is the daily maintenance” (Suidas, quoted by Alford). The denarius (“penny” of English version, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-28.htm" title="But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that you owe.">Matthew 18:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-37.htm" title="David therefore himself calls him Lord; and from where is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.">Mark 12:37</a>) amounted to between sixpence and sevenpence of our money, and was the usual daily pay of the labourer, and of the soldier. (See especially Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-2.htm" title="And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.">Matthew 20:2</a>.) It is difficult to speak of this as other than terribly high prices for food. The whole of a man’s pay goes for food, and even the coarser bread is so expensive that it takes a whole day’s wages to supply food for three adults. It has been thought that the voice calls to the rider to check his devastations, lest the growing famine should exterminate the whole human race. This may be, but the check is at a point which has already wrought the highest misery. The extent of the misery may be imagined by imagining what wretchedness would be entailed were a man obliged to pay three or four shillings for bread sufficient to keep him nourished for a day. Or we may measure it by the estimate of the disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-37.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Give you them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?">Mark 6:37</a>) that two hundred pennyworth of bread would give a short meal to upwards of five thousand people. At the price in this seal, the cost of bread would have so risen that the two hundred pennyworth of bread would not suffice to feed one thousand. But what is meant by the words, “the oil and wine do not thou hurt”? They were not, like the bread, necessary to life, but among its luxuries and superfluities. There is a kind of irony in times of straitness, when the necessaries are scarcely to be had, and the luxuries remain comparatively low in price. The splendours and comforts of life are held cheap, when hunger is showing that the life is more than the dainty meat, and the body than raiment. The seal then tells the seer that in the ages the Church of Christ must expect to see famines and distress in the world, and luxuries abounding in the midst of straitness. Is it not true that the contrast, which is so ugly, between pampered opulence and indolent, pauperism, is the result of the prevalence of world-principles? Wealth, self-indulgent and heartless, and poverty, reckless and self-willed, are sure tokens that the golden rule of Christ is not understood and obeyed. There is a similar experience in the history of the Church. The red horse of controversy is followed by the black horse of spiritual starvation. In the heat of polemical pride and passion for theological conquest is developed that love of barren dogmatics which forgets the milk of the word and the bread of life, which are the needed food of souls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/6-5.htm" title="And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see.

For when there is great plenty men do not think it worth their while to weigh and measure what they eat and drink; but when there is a famine or scarcity they are obliged to do it. <span class="ital">And I heard a voice </span>— It seems from God himself; <span class="ital">in the midst of the four </span>living creatures, <span class="ital">saying, A measure of wheat for a penny, </span>&c. — As if he had said to the horseman, Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther. Let there be <span class="ital">a measure of wheat for a penny </span>— This may seem, to an English reader, a description of great plenty, but it certainly intends the contrary. The word <span class="greekheb">χοινιξ</span>, <span class="ital">chœnix, </span>a Grecian measure, was only about equal to our quart, and was no more than was allowed to a slave for his daily food. And the Roman penny, <span class="ital">the denarius, </span>about 7½<span class="ital">d. </span>English, was the usual daily wages of a labourer: so that, if a man’s daily labour could earn no more than his daily bread, without other provision for himself and family, corn must needs bear a very high price. This must have been fulfilled when the Grecian measure and the Roman money were still in use, as also when that measure was the common measure, and this money the current coin. It was so in Egypt under Trajan. <span class="ital">And three measures of barley for a penny </span>— Either barley was, in common, far cheaper among the ancients than wheat, or the prophecy mentions this as something peculiar. <span class="ital">And see thou hurt not the oil and the wine </span>— Let there not be a scarcity of every thing. Let there be some provision left to supply the want of the rest. Lowman interprets this third seal of the scarcity in the time of the Antonines, from A.D. 138 to A.D. 193, and produces passages from Tertullian and the Roman historians, concerning the calamity the empire endured by scarcity in this period. But Bishop Newton supposes this third period commences with Septimius Severus, who was an emperor from the south, being a native of Africa; and was an enacter of just and equal laws, and very severe and implacable to offences; he would not suffer even petty larcenies to go unpunished; as neither would Alexander Severus in the same period, who was a most severe judge against thieves; and was so fond of the Christian maxim, <span class="ital">Whatsoever you would not have done to you, do not you to another, </span>that he commanded it to be engraven on the palace, and on the public buildings. These two emperors were also no less celebrated for the procuring of corn and oil, and other provisions; and for supplying the Romans with them, after they had experienced the want of them: thus repairing the neglects of former times, and correcting the abuses of former princes. The colour of the <span class="ital">black horse </span>befits the severity of their nature and their name, and the <span class="ital">balances </span>are the well-known emblem of justice, as well as an intimation of scarcity. And the proclamation for justice and judgment, and for the procuration of corn, oil, and wine, is fitly made by a creature like a man. This period continued during the reigns of the Septimian family, about forty-two years.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-8 Christ, the Lamb, opens the first seal: observe what appeared. A rider on a white horse. By the going forth of this white horse, a time of peace, or the early progress of the Christian religion, seems to be intended; its going forth in purity, at the time when its heavenly Founder sent his apostles to teach all nations, adding, Lo! I am with you alway, even to the end of the world. The Divine religion goes out crowned, having the Divine favour resting upon it, armed spiritually against its foes, and destined to be victorious in the end. On opening the second seal, a red horse appeared; this signifies desolating judgments. The sword of war and persecution is a dreadful judgment; it takes away peace from the earth, one of the greatest blessings; and men who should love one another, and help one another, are set upon killing one another. Such scenes also followed the pure age of early Christianity, when, neglectful of charity and the bond of peace, the Christian leaders, divided among themselves, appealed to the sword, and entangled themselves in guilt. On opening the third seal, a black horse appeared; a colour denoting mourning and woe, darkness and ignorance. He that sat on it had a yoke in his hand. Attempts were made to put a yoke of superstitious observances on the disciples. As the stream of Christianity flowed further from its pure fountain, it became more and more corrupt. During the progress of this black horse, the necessaries of life should be at excessive prices, and the more costly things should not be hurt. According to prophetic language, these articles signified that food of religious knowledge, by which the souls of men are sustained unto everlasting life; such we are invited to buy, Isa 55:1. But when the dark clouds of ignorance and superstition, denoted by the black horse, spread over the Christian world, the knowledge and practice of true religion became scarce. When a people loathe their spiritual food, God may justly deprive them of their daily bread. The famine of bread is a terrible judgment; but the famine of the word is more so. Upon opening the fourth seal, another horse appeared, of a pale colour. The rider was Death, the king of terrors. The attendants, or followers of this king of terrors, hell, a state of eternal misery to all who die in their sins; and in times of general destruction, multitudes go down unprepared into the pit. The period of the fourth seal is one of great slaughter and devastation, destroying whatever may tend to make life happy, making ravages on the spiritual lives of men. Thus the mystery of iniquity was completed, and its power extended both over the lives and consciences of men. The exact times of these four seals cannot be ascertained, for the changes were gradual. God gave them power, that is, those instruments of his anger, or those judgments: all public calamities are at his command; they only go forth when God sends them, and no further than he permits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when he had opened the third seal - Unfolding another portion of the volume. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>.<p>I heard the third beast say, Come and see - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>. It is not apparent why the third beast is represented as taking a particular interest in the opening of this seal (compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-3.htm">Revelation 6:3</a>), nor is it necessary to show why it was so. The general design seems to have been, to represent each one of the four living creatures as interested in the opening of the seals, but the order in which they did this does not seem to be a matter of importance.<p>And I beheld, and lo, a black horse - The specifications of the symbol here are the following:<p>(a) As before, the horse. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>.<p>(b) The color of the horse: "lo, a black horse." This would properly denote distress and calamity - for black has been regarded always as such a symbol. So Virgil speaks of fear as black: "atrumque timorem" (Aen. ix. 619). So again, Georg. iv. 468:<p>"Caligantem nigra formidine lucum."<p>So, as applied to the dying Acca, Aeneas xi. 825:<p>"Tenebris nigrescunt omnia circum."<p>Black, in the Scriptures, is the image of fear, of famine, of death. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-10.htm">Lamentations 5:10</a>; "our skin was black like an oven, because of the terrible famine." <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a>; "because of the drought Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are in deep mourning (literally, black) for the land." <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-6.htm">Joel 2:6</a>; "all faces shall gather blackness." <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-10.htm">Nahum 2:10</a>; "the knees smite together, and there is great pain in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>. See also Bochart, Hieroz. P. i. lib. ii. c. vii. pp. 106, 107. From the color of the horse here introduced we should naturally look for some dire calamity, though the nature of the calamity would not be designated by the mere use of the word "black." What the calamity was to be must be determined by what follows in the symbol. Famine, pestiilence, oppression, heavy taxation, tyranny, invasion - any of these might be denoted by the color of the horse.<p>(c) The balances: "and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand." The original word rendered here as "a pair of balances," is &#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  zugon. This word properly means a yoke, serving to couple anything together, as a yoke for cattle. Hence it is used to denote the beam of a balance, or of a pair of scales - and is evidently so used here. The idea is, that something was to be weighed, in order to ascertain either its quantity or its value. Scales or balances are the emblems of justice or equity (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-6.htm">Job 31:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a>); and when joined with symbols that denote the sale of grain and fruit by weight, become the symbol of scarcity. Thus, "bread by weight" <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a> denotes scarcity. So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>, "And they shall eat bread by weight." The use of balances here as a symbol would signify that something was to be accurately and carefully weighed out.<p>The connection leads us to suppose that this would pertain to the necessaries of life, and that it would occur either in consequence of scarcity, or because there would be an accurate or severe exaction, as in collecting a revenue on these articles. The balance was commonly the symbol of equity and justice; but it was also, sometimes, the symbol of exaction and oppression, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm">Hosea 12:7</a>; "The balance of deceit is in his hands; he loveth to oppress." If the balances stood alone, and there were no proclamation as to what was to occur, we should look, under this seal, to a time of the exact administration of justice, as scales or balances are now used as emblems of the rigid application of the laws and of the principles of justice in courts, or in public affairs. If this representation stood alone, or if the black horse and the scales constituted the whole of the symbol, we should look for some severe administration, or perhaps some heavy calamity under a rigorous administration of laws. The reference, however, to the "wheat and barley," and to the price for which they were to be weighed out, serves still further to limit and define the meaning of the symbol as having reference to the necessaries of life - to the productions of the land - to the actual capital of the country. Whether this refers to scarcity, or to taxation, or both, must be determined by the other parts of the symbol.<p>(d) The proclamation: And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say. That is, from the throne, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. The voice was not that of one of the four beasts, but it seemed to come from among them. As the rider went forth, this was the proclamation that was made in regard to him; or this is what is symbolized in his going forth, to wit, that there would be such a state of things that a measure of wheat would be sold for a penny, etc. The proclamation consists essentially of two things - what refers to the price or value of wheat and barley, and what requires that care shall be taken not to injure the oil and the wine. Each of these demands explanation.<p>A measure of wheat for a penny - See the margin. The word rendered "measure" - &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3be;  choinix - denotes an Attic measure for grain and things dry, equal to the 48th part of the Attic medimnus, or the 8th part of the Roman modius, and consequently was nearly equivalent to one quart English (Robinson's Lexicon). The word rendered "penny," &#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  de&#772;narion - Latin, denarius - was of the same value as the Greek &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;  drachme&#772;, and was equivalent to about fourteen cents or seven-pence (circa mid-19th century). This was the usual price of a day's labor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-9.htm">Matthew 20:9</a>. The choenix, or measure of grain here referred to, was the ordinary daily allowance for one man (Odyssey xix. 27, 28). See Stuart, in loco. The common price of the Attic medimnus of wheat was five or six denarii; but here, as that contained 48 choenixes or quarts, the price would be augmented to 48 denarii - or it would be about eight times as dear as ordinary; that is, there would be a scarcity or famine. The price of a bushel of wheat at this rate would be about four dollars and a half or 18 shillings - a price which would indicate great scarcity, and which would give rise to much distress.<p>And three measures of barley for a penny - It would seem from this that barley usually bore about one-third the price of wheat. It was a less valuable grain, and perhaps was produced in greater abundance. This is not far from the proportion which the price of this grain usually bears to that of wheat, and here, as in the case of the wheat, the thing which would be indicated would be scarcity. This proclamation of "a measure of wheat for a penny" was heard either as addressed to the horseman, as a rule of action for him, or as addressed by the horseman as he went forth. If the former is the meaning, it would be an appropriate address to one who was going forth to collect tribute - with reference to the exact manner in which this tribute was to be collected, implying some sort of severity of exaction; or to one who should distribute wheat and barley out of the public granaries at an advanced price, indicating scarcity. Thus, it would mean that a severe and heavy tax - represented by the scales and the scarcity - or a tax so severe as to make grain dear, was referred to. If the latter is the meaning, then the idea is that there would be a scarcity, and that grain would be dealt out by the government at a high and oppressive price. The latter idea would be as consonant with the symbol of the scales and the price mentioned as the other, if it were not for the additional injunction not to "hurt the oil and the wine" - which cannot be well applied to the idea of dealing out grain at a high price. It can, however, be connected, by a fair interpretation of that passage, with such a severity of taxation that there would be a propriety in such a command - for, as we shall see, under the explanation of that phrase, such a law was actually promulgated as resulting from severity of taxation. The idea, then, in the passage before us, would seem to be:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Mr. Mede thinks that Septimius Severus, the Roman emperor, who came from Africa, from the south, on which side was the living creature that spoke to John, is intended, and in which country black horses were in great esteem; and he was the only African that ever was emperor of Rome before (c): and the same author thinks, that his having a pair of balances in his hand expresses the strict justice that emperor was famous for; but rather it signifies famine, and such a scarcity as that bread is delivered out by weight to men; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>. <p>(a) Spartianus in Vita Severi, &amp; Lampridius in Vita Alexandri.

As to the expression, <span class="greekheb">ζυγός</span> means properly the beam which unites the two scales, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-11.htm" title="A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the bag are his work.">Proverbs 16:11</a>; as to the subject itself, since by the weighing of the grain which otherwise is measured, famine is represented, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm" title="And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.">Leviticus 26:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:">Ezekiel 4:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> before <span class="greekheb">φωνὴν</span>[2052] corresponds with the circumstance that, to John, the person from whom the voice proceeds[2053] remains unknown.[2054] “<span class="ital">Audivi ut vocem</span>,” a Latin would say; i.e., “I heard (something) like a voice.” That the cry sounds forth “in the midst of the four beings,” is, in itself, natural, since the unsealing of the book of fate occurs at the throne of God, which is in the midst of the four beings;[2055] but as it is not without significance that the four beings, as representatives of the living creatures on earth, cry out to John, <span class="greekheb">ἕρχου</span>, so is it likewise significant that in the midst of those beings the cry sounds forth, which accompanies the figure of a plague pertaining to living creatures[2056] The first half of the call sounds just as when any thing is offered for sale.[2057] The gen. <span class="greekheb">δηναρίου</span> is that of the price.[2058] The second sentence contains a command which prescribes to the horseman, not only as the personification of the famine, but as the bearer of the visitation, the limit of the plague ordained by the Lord. Oil and wine are to grow as ordinarily: <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἀδικήσῃς</span>, i.e., “Do them no harm, injure them not;”[2059] although wheat and barley, and therefore the unconditionally necessary means of subsistence, are to be so dear that a day-laborer for his daily labor receives a denarius,[2060] nothing more than daily food for himself,—a <span class="ital">choinix</span> of wheat, which is a man’s[2061] daily nourishment. If, therefore, the famine indicated do not reach the utmost extreme of hunger,[2062] yet the grievousness of the plague is obvious to every one who has learned to know the life of the people, viz., of the lower classes, in the neighborhood. That oil and wine remain exempted, is, of course, a mitigation of the famine; but on the other hand, by the plentiful presence of these two means of nourishment, even though in Oriental life they are luxuries far less than among us, the <span class="greekheb">πειρασμός</span> lying in the famine which had entered is essentially strengthened, and the critical force also of these plagues in an ethical respect, which belong to the signs preceding Christ’s coming,[2063] intensified.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2048] De Wette, Hengstenb., etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2049] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm" title="And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-4.htm" title="And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given to him a great sword.">Revelation 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.

Purely arbitrary is the allegorizing interpretation, e.g., in Beda,[2067] Vitr.,[2068] C. a Lap.,[2069] Stern,[2070] etc. N. de Lyra understands by the black horse, the Roman army; by the horseman, Titus; by the wheat and barley, Jews; by oil and wine, Christians. The acme of arbitrary interpretation is attained by those who, as even Böhmer, understand the wheat and barley properly, and the wine and oil figuratively as a designation of Christians. Any such distinction would have been indicated by the omission of the art. with <span class="greekheb">σίτου</span> and <span class="greekheb">κριθῶν</span>, whereas, on the other hand, it is found with <span class="greekheb">ἕλαιον</span> and <span class="greekheb">οἶνον</span>. But although the art. in the latter case designates simply the class as a whole, this is lacking in the former case just as naturally; since there not the kind of fruit as such, but a quantity, is mentioned, which therefore allows no other designation than that of the mass, which in simple composition is given as <span class="greekheb">χοῖνιξ σίτου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2064] Grot., Wetst., Harenb., Herd., Böhm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2065] Cf.

Wordsworth takes the <span class="accented">third living being</span> to be that with the human face, and considers it to be typical of the whole vision of the third seal, by symbolizing the source of the next trial of the Church; namely, the rise of heresy, which he thinks is depicted by this appearance. But probably the four living beings represent all creation, and thus invite St. John to witness the troubles in store for mankind in general. (For a full consideration of this point, see on Revelation 4:6.) <span class="cmt_word">Come and see.</span> The majority of authorities emit "and see" (see the corresponding passage in vers. 1 and 3, where also is discussed the question as to whom the sentence is addressed). <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld, and lo a black horse.</span> The <span class="accented">black</span> is typical of woe and mourning - the result of the scarcity foretold in the following words. This vision is typical of famine; it is the second of the three trials foretold - war, famine, death (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14.htm">Ezekiel 14</a>, where the "four sore plagues" are wild beasts, the sword, famine, and pestilence). St. John seems to foretell the recurrence of three of these troubles to try mankind in general, and Christians in particular. Those who interpret the vision to mean scarcity of faith, or in other words the prevalence of heresy, do so on the supposition that the events denoted at the opening of the seals follow each other in historical order. They therefore assign these events to the period subsequent to A.D. , when persecution had ceased, and the rise of heresies took place. Others, accepting the historical view, yet consider the vision to foretell famine; and Grotius and Wetstein point to the famine in the reign of Claudius as the fulfilment. But it is not probable that the meaning of the book is so limited in extent; but rather that its prophecies point to events which have happened, and are recurring, and will continue to recur until the end of the world. We therefore understand that this vision denotes famine in the ordinary sense, as one of the trials awaiting the members of the Church of God at various times during the existence of the Church on earth. This affliction may happen concurrently with, or antecedent to, or subsequent to, any of those trials denoted by the other visions, and even the victorious career of the Church as foretold under the first seal; for by suffering the Church conquers and is made perfect. <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</span> <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is rightly rendered "a balance," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-10.htm">Ezekiel 45:10</a>; not (as it primarily meant) a "yoke." The idea intended to be conveyed is that of scarcity so great that food is weighed carefully as something very rare and precious, though there is not yet a complete absence of food. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Come and see<p>Omit and see.<p>Black<p>The color of mourning and famine.

The cross-beam of the loom, to which the warp was fixed; the thwarts joining the opposite sides of a ship; the beam of the balance, and hence the balance itself.
