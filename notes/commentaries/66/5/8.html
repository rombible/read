The vials (which seem to be censers, as they hold the incense) and the harps, it is perhaps more natural to suppose, were in the hands of the four-and-twenty elders, and not of the living creatures. Here, then, we have the praises (represented by the harps), and the prayers (represented by the censers) of the world-wide and age-long Church of Christ. The comparison of prayer with incense is in strict accordance with Old Testament language. “Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>). The incense held a conspicuous place in the ritual of the Temple. The greatest care was to be taken in the composition of the incense, and the same compound was not to be used anywhere but in the sanctuary. These precautions suggest its typical character. The true odours are the heart-prayers of God’s children. “Of these three sweet ingredient perfumes,” says Archbishop Leighton, alluding to the composition of the Temple-incense, “namely, petition, confession, thanksgiving, is the incense of prayer, and by the divine fire of love it ascends unto God, the heart and all with it; and when the hearts of the saints unite in joint prayer, the pillar of sweet smoke goes up the greater and the fuller.” Every prayer which broke out in sob from an agonising heart, every sigh of the solitary and struggling Christian, every groan of those groping God- ward, mingles here with the songs of the happy and triumphant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints....">Revelation 5:8-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when he had taken the book, the four </span>living creatures <span class="ital">fell down </span>— Now is homage done to the Lamb by the whole Christian Church and all its members, represented by these four living creatures.

He governs the world, not merely as a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise; the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers of the saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He has not only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour and preferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makes them priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer up spiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is, and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures, to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, and who shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart for himself by his blood.

Usually in such worship there was entire prostration on the earth. See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-2.htm">Matthew 2:2</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">1 Corinthians 14:25</a> note.<p>Having every one of them harps - That is, as the construction, and the propriety of the case would seem to demand, the elders had each of them harps. The whole prostrated themselves with profound reverence; the elders had harps and censers, and broke out into a song of praise for redemption. This construction is demanded, because:<p>(a) the Greek word - &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  echontes - more properly agrees with the word "elders" - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  presbuteroi - and not with the word "beasts" -  &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b1;  zo&#772;a;<p>(b) there is an incongruity in the representation that the living creatures, in the form of a lion, a calf, an eagle, should have harps and censers; and,<p>(c) the song of praise that is sung <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a> is one that properly applies to the elders as the representatives of the church, and not to the living creatures - "Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood."<p>The harp was a well-known instrument used in the service of God. Josephus describes it as having ten strings, and as struck with a key (Ant. <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>). See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>.<p>And golden vials - The word "vial" with us, denoting a small slender bottle with a narrow neck, evidently does not express the idea here. The article here referred to was used for offering incense, and must have been a vessel with a large open mouth. The word "bowl" or "goblet" would better express the idea, and it is so explained by Prof. Robinson, Lexicon, and by Prof. Stuart, in loco. The Greek word - &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;  phiale&#772; - occurs in the New Testament only in Revelation Rev 5:8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-7.htm">Revelation 15:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1-4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-8.htm">Revelation 16:8</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>, and is uniformly rendered "vial" and "vials," though the idea is always that of a "bowl" or "goblet."<p>Full of odours - Or rather, as in the margin, full of incense -  &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  thumiamato&#772;n. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>.<p>Which are the prayers of saints - Which represent or denote the prayers of saints. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense." The meaning is, that incense was a proper emblem of prayer. This seems to have been in two respects:<p>(a) as being acceptable to God - as incense produced an agreeable fragrance; and,<p>(b) in its being wafted toward heaven - ascending toward the eternal throne.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>, an angel is represented as having a golden censer: "And there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. The representation there undoubtedly is, that the angel is employed in presenting the prayers of the saints which were offered on earth before the throne. See the notes on that passage. It is most natural to interpret the passage before us in the same way. The allusion is clearly to the temple service, and to the fact that incense was offered by the priest in the temple itself at the time that prayer was offered by the people in the courts of the temple. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9-10</a>. The idea here is, therefore, that the representatives of the church in heaven - the elders - spoken of as "priests" <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>, are described as officiating in the temple above in behalf of the church still below, and as offering incense while the church is engaged in prayer.<p>It is not said that they offer the prayers themselves, but that they offer incense as representing the prayers of the saints. If this be the correct interpretation, as it seems to be the obvious one, then the passage lays no foundation for the opinion expressed by Prof. Stuart, as derived from this passage (in loco), that prayer is offered by the redeemed in heaven. Whatever may be the truth on that point - on which the Bible seems to be silent - it will find no support from the passage before us. Adoration, praise, thanksgiving, are represented as the employment of the saints in heaven: the only representation respecting prayer as pertaining to that world is, that there are emblems there which symbolize its ascent before the throne, and which show that it is acceptable to God. It is an interesting and beautiful representation that there are in heaven appropriate symbols of ascending prayer, and that while in the outer courts here below we offer prayer, incense, emblematic of it, ascends in the holy of holies above. The impression which this should leave on our minds ought to be, that our prayers are wafted before the throne, and are acceptable to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. had taken&#8212;Greek, "took."<p>fell down before the Lamb&#8212;who shares worship and the throne with the Father.<p>harps&#8212;Two oldest manuscripts, A, B, Syriac and Coptic read, "a harp": a kind of guitar, played with the hand or a quill.<p>vials&#8212;"bowls" [Tregelles]; censers.<p>odours&#8212;Greek, "incense."<p>prayers of saints&#8212;as the angel offers their prayers (Re 8:3) with incense (compare Ps 141:2).

Concerning the symbolical meaning “its,” cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm" title="And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.">Ezekiel 8:11</a>. Arbitrarily and against the meaning of the context, Hengstenb. understands by the prayers symbolically offered only intercessory prayers, whose chief subject is the protection and perfection of the Church, and judgment upon enemies; while he regards the harps as referring to prayers of adoration and thanksgiving.[1933]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ἉΓΊΩΝ</span></span></span>, i.e., of Christians.[1934] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne....">Revelation 8:3-4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-7.htm" title="And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.">Revelation 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-10.htm" title="He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword.

The misunderstanding of this as referring to saints already in heaven[1935] is inapplicable for the reason that the idea that the prayers of the saints are offered to God by the elders[1936] presupposes the fact that the saints themselves are not present with God. With this agrees the mode in which the elders, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>, speak of the saints.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The remark of C. a Lap.: “Note here against Vigilantius, Luther, Calvin, and other Hagiomachoi, that the saints pray for vs, and offer our prayers to God,” is, in other respects, entirely wrong: because, <span class="ital">first</span>, the “elders” are in no way identical with the saints who are meant; <span class="ital">secondly</span>, while, on the Lutheran side, it is not at all denied that the members of the Church triumphant pray for those of the Church militant [see Note XLVI., p. 217], there is no allusion whatever to the invocation of saints contended against on the Lutheran side; and, <span class="ital">finally</span>, it is entirely incorrect to regard the forms of the twenty-four elders included in the plan as real personages, and without any thing further to construct a dogmatical statement upon the act symbolically ascribed to them. Erroneous also is De Wette’s conjecture that John appears to know nothing of a mediatorial office of Christ. Of this, nothing can be expressly said in the present passage, although of course the entire Christology of the Apoc. essentially includes that fundamental Christian thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1924] De Wette.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1925] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-28.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:">Matthew 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-25.htm" title="But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.">Matthew 9:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1926] “<span class="ital">Als er nahm</span>,” Luth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1927] <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1928] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-13.htm" title="And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.">Revelation 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1929] In other respects the <span class="greekheb">λέγοντες</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>, has a different relation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1930] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:">Revelation 14:2</a> sqq., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-7.htm" title="Which executes judgment for the oppressed: which gives food to the hungry.

Quenstedt (<span class="ital">Theol. Didact.-pol.</span>, iv. 365): “That the saints in heaven triumphing with Christ pray, in general, for the Church, is probably inferred from this passage.

A thrill of satisfaction over Christ’s ability. “It is the manner of God thus to endear mercies to us, as he endeared a wife to Adam.

Harps held by living creatures who had no hands but only wings, and the collocation of a harp played by a person who is at the same time holding a bowl, are traits which warn us against prosaically visualising such visions. Hirscht compares the adoration of Rameses II. before the sun-god, the monarch’s left hand holding his offering, his right grasping a sceptre and scourge.

If, however, as Wordsworth considers, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders together symbolize the Church, the phrase would apply to both.

The Revised Version "bowls" is better than "vials." The idea is, no doubt, taken from the shallow bowls which were placed upon the golden altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>), and in which incense was burned. The <span class="accented">odours</span> are the <span class="accented">incense.

Also of the shallow cup, usually without a foot, in which libations were drawn out of the mixer. Herodotus says that at Plataea the Spartan Helots were bidden by Pausanias to bring together the booty of the Persian camp, and that they found "many golden mixers and bowls (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;), and other &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (drinking-vessels)" (ix., 30).

Edersheim, describing the offering of incense in the temple, says: "As the President gave the word of command which marked that 'the time of incense had come,' the whole multitude of the people without withdrew from the inner court and fell down before the Lord, spreading their hands in silent prayer. It is this most solemn period, when, throughout the vast temple-buildings, deep silence rested on the worshipping multitude, while within the sanctuary itself the priest laid the incense on the golden altar, and the cloud of odors rose up before the Lord, which serves as the image of heavenly things in Revelation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-1.htm">Revelation 8:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-4.htm">Revelation 8:4</a>). The prayers offered by priests and people at this part of the service are recorded by tradition as follows: 'True it is that Thou art Jehovah, our God and the God of our fathers; our King and the King of our fathers; our Savior and the Rock of our salvation; our Help and our Deliverer. Thy name is from everlasting, and there is no God beside Thee. A new song did they that were delivered sing to Thy name by the seashore. Together did all praise and own Thee as King, and say, 'Jehovah shall reign who saveth Israel.'"
