In acts of religious worship we come nigh to God, and must come by Christ; the throne of God could not be approached by sinners, were it not for a Mediator. They were clothed with the robes of justification, holiness, and victory; and they had palms in their hands, as conquerors used to appear in their triumphs. Such a glorious appearance will the faithful servants of God make at last, when they have fought the good fight of faith, and finished their course. With a loud voice they gave to God and the Lamb the praise of the great salvation. Those who enjoy eternal happiness must and will bless both the Father and the Son; they will do it publicly, and with fervour. We see what is the work of heaven, and we ought to begin it now, to have our hearts much in it, and to long for that world where our praises, as well as our happiness, will be made perfect.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And all the angels stood round about the throne - notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>.<p>And about the elders - notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>.<p>And the four beasts - notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. The meaning is, that the angels stood in the outer circle, or outside of the elders and the four living creatures. The redeemed, it is manifest, occupied the inner circle, and were near the throne, though their precise location is not mentioned. The angels sympathize with the church redeemed and triumphant, as they did with the church in its conflicts and trials, and they now appropriately unite with that church in adoring and praising God. They see in that redemption new displays of the character of God, and they rejoice that that church is rescued from its troubles, and is now brought triumphant to heaven.<p>And fell before the throne on their faces - The usual position of profound adoration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-10.htm">Revelation 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>.<p>And worshipped God - notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11-12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.
