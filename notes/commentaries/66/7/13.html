Or, in order to give him a more exact information concerning the persons who were clothed in the white robes of purity, honour, and dignity, one of the elders led him on by a question to ask of him a fuller account of them. <span class="ital">What are these which are arrayed in white robes? </span>— And make such a splendid appearance; <span class="ital">and whence came, </span>or come, <span class="ital">they?

Yet these could not be all martyrs, for the martyrs could not be such a multitude as no <span class="ital">man could number. </span>But as all the angels appear here, so probably did all the souls of the righteous, who had lived from the beginning of the world. All these may be said, more or less, to come <span class="ital">out of great tribulation,, </span>of various kinds, wisely and graciously allotted by God to all his children; <span class="ital">and have washed their robes </span>— From all guilt; <span class="ital">and made them white </span>— In all purity and holiness; <span class="ital">in, </span>or by, <span class="ital">the blood of the Lamb </span>— Through which alone we obtain remission of sins, and the influences of the sanctifying Spirit, so that they are advanced to the state of glory and happiness in which you see them. <span class="ital">Therefore </span>— Because they came out of great affliction, and have washed their robes in Christ’s blood; <span class="ital">are they before the throne of God </span>— It seems even nearer than the angels; <span class="ital">and serve him, day and night </span>— Speaking after the manner of men; that is, continually; <span class="ital">in his temple </span>— In heaven; <span class="ital">and he that sitteth on the throve shall dwell among them </span>— <span class="greekheb">Σκηνωσει επ αυτους</span>, <span class="ital">shall have his tent over them: </span>shall spread his glory over them as a covering. <span class="ital">They shall hunger no more</span> — They shall be no more subject to any of their former infirmities, wants, or afflictions; <span class="ital">neither shall the sun light on them, </span>&c. — None of the natural or common evils of the world below shall reach them any more. <span class="ital">For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them — </span>With eternal peace and joy, so that they shall hunger no more; <span class="ital">and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters </span>— The comforts of the Holy Spirit, so that they shall thirst no more; neither shall they grieve any more, for <span class="ital">God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes </span>— Every sorrow, with every cause of sorrow, shall be fully taken away for ever. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:13-17 Faithful Christians deserve our notice and respect; we should mark the upright. Those who would gain knowledge, must not be ashamed to seek instruction from any who can give it. The way to heaven is through many tribulations; but tribulation, how great soever, shall not separate us from the love of God. Tribulation makes heaven more welcome and more glorious. It is not the blood of the martyrs, but the blood of the Lamb, that can wash away sin, and make the soul pure and clean in the sight of God; other blood stains, this is the only blood that makes the robes of the saints white and clean. They are happy in their employment; heaven is a state of service, though not of suffering; it is a state of rest, but not of sloth; it isa praising, delightful rest. They have had sorrows, and shed many tears on account of sin and affliction; but God himself, with his own gracious hand, will wipe those tears away. He deals with them as a tender father. This should support the Christian under all his troubles. As all the redeemed owe their happiness wholly to sovereign mercy; so the work and worship of God their Saviour is their element; his presence and favour complete their happiness, nor can they conceive of any other joy. To Him may all his people come; from him they receive every needed grace; and to him let them offer all praise and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And one of the elders - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>. That is, as there understood, one of the representatives of the church before the throne.<p>Answered - The word "answer," with us, means "to reply to something which has been said." In the Bible, however, the word is not infrequently used in the beginning of a speech, where nothing has been said - as if it were a reply to something that might be said on the subject; or to something that is passing through the mind of another; or to something in the case under consideration which suggests an inquiry. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-26.htm">Daniel 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-8.htm">Acts 5:8</a>. Thus it is used here. John was looking on the host, and reflecting on the state of things; and to the train of thought passing through his mind the angel answered by an inquiry as to a part of that host. Prof. Stuart renders it accosted me.<p>What are these which are arrayed in white robes? - Who are these? The object evidently is to bring the case of these persons more particularly into view. The vast host with branches of palm had attracted the attention of John, but it was the object of the speaker to turn his thoughts to a particular part of the host - the martyrs who stood among them. He would seem, therefore, to have turned to a particular portion of the immense multitude of the redeemed, and by an emphasis on the word these - "Who are these" - to have fixed the eye upon them. All those who are before the throne are represented as clothed in white robes <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, but the eye might be directed to a particular part of them as grouped together, and as having something special in their position or appearance. There was a propriety in thus directing the mind of John to the martyrs as triumphing in heaven in a time when the churches were suffering persecution, and in view of the vision which he had had of times of darkness and calamity coming upon the world at the opening of the sixth seal. Beyond all the scenes of sorrow and grief, he was permitted to see the martyrs triumphing in heaven.<p>Arrayed in white robes - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<p>And whence came they? - The object is to fix the attention more distinctly on what is said of them, that they came up out of great tribulation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. answered&#8212;namely, to my thoughts; spoke, asking the question which might have been expected to arise in John's mind from what has gone before.

This elder was not the Apostle Peter, as some Popish interpreters have thought; and still less Pope Silvester, who lived in the times of Constantine; be is much more likely, according to others, to be Constantine himself, the first of the elders, or the chief magistrate when the church sprung out of its troubles, and enjoyed rest and peace; though some have thought of the prophet Isaiah, since many things said by this elder are to be found in his prophecy; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; but it is needless to inquire who the particular person was; it is enough to say, that he was one of the four and twenty elders about the throne, one that belonged to the church, perhaps the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>; who, in a visionary way, is represented as accosting John upon the above sight. The word "answered" is a common Hebraism of the New Testament, which is often used when nothing goes before, to which a return is made; and only signifies here, that the elder opened his month, began to speak, and called to John, and said as follows: <p>what are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? This he said, not as being ignorant of them, or of the reason of their being clothed in this manner, nor of the place and state from whence they came, as appears by the account afterwards given of them by him; but to stir up John to take more notice of them, as being a body of men that were worthy of observation and contemplation, and were worth his while to consider well who they were, and from whence they came; and also to try him whether he knew them or not, and to bring him to a confession of his ignorance; and that he might have an opportunity of giving him some hints about them, which might be useful to him, and to the churches, and for the explanation of this vision, and other parts of this prophecy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?</span><p>(10) A passage over to the explanation of the vision, which the angel enquires of John to stir him up in this verse and John in the form of speech, both acknowledges his own ignorance, attributing knowledge to the angel, and also in a humble manner requests the explanation of the vision.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/7-13.htm" title="And one of the elders answered, saying to me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and from where came they?...">Revelation 7:13-17</a>.

Here the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΡΊΝΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> may be referred[2343] to the (unexpressed) desire of John to learn something further concerning the multitude beheld in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a>; but even without accepting any such unexpressed question of John, the simple reference of the fact of the vision, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a> sqq., as the occasion for the declaration of the elders, is sufficient. The form of a dialogue,[2344] with its dramatic vividness, serves to emphasize the point under consideration; for, by asking what he intends to explain,[2345] the elder brings John to the answer which comprises the acknowledgment of his own ignorance, and the expression of the wish for an explanation. Thus, then the explanation, awaited with expectancy, follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know.

From the same standpoint, the pres. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΡΧΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> yields the idea, that they come before the eyes of the gazing prophet, and assemble before the throne of God. For it appears more suitable to one contemplating the standpoint of the vision in all the other points up to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm" title="Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.">Revelation 7:15</a><span class="ital"> a</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">. <span class="greekheb">Ν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΑὐΤ</span>.</span></span>), to hold fast, also, to the pres. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΡΧΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span>, than[2353] to regard this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΡΧΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> in the sense of a future, and to find the allusion in the fact that that multitude was actually still upon earth, and is only still to come.

To that entire multitude, which is already presented to John in the vision as in final glory, there yet belongs first, since they are, in reality, still upon earth, the great hope of which the elder speaks: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΚΑΘ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΠῚ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΣΚΗΝΏΣΕΙ ἘΠʼ ΑὐΤ</span>., <span class="greekheb">Οὐ ΠΕΙΝΆΣΟΥΣΙΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> It is throughout sufficient that the explanatory address maintains in the beginning the standpoint of the vision, and that it is not until the close that the proper situation of affairs is opened.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τῆς ΘΛΊΨΕΩς Τῆς ΜΕΓΆΛΗς</span></span></span>.

Concerning the relation expressed by the aor., see on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ἘΡΧΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span>. On the subject itself, Beda remarks, “He does not speak of the martyrs alone: they are washed in their own blood.” Thus he has already[2356] correctly recognized the idea at once obvious, which elsewhere is marked by the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΡΝΊΟΥ</span></span></span>,[2357] that the whiteness of the robes has been produced by the (atoning and redeeming) blood of Christ as the Lamb of God.[2358] But the idea recognized, in general, by Beda, of the cleansing power of martyrdom, has been introduced into the text not only by expositors like N. de Lyra, who regards the blood of the Lamb as the blood of martyrs, “because it is the blood of his members,” but even by Ew. i., manifestly because of his erroneous reference of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a> sqq. to martyrs, as he remarks, “by the blood of Christ, i.e., the death which they endured because of Christ’s doctrine, and having followed in this the example of Christ,” etc. It is, in other respects, contrary to the nature of the figures, when Hengstenb. tries to distinguish the <span class="ital">washing</span> from the <span class="ital">making white</span>, and refers the former to the forgiveness of sins, and the latter to sanctification; such a washing, however, is designated whereby the robes are made white.
