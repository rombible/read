This verse simply tells us that the woman fled; we read afterwards that it was persecution which drove her into the wilderness. As long as the evil one can be called the prince of this world: as long, that is, as the world refuses to recognise her true Prince, and pays homage to worldliness, and baseness, and falseness in heart, mind, or life, so long must the Church, in so far as she is faithful to Him who is true, dwell as an exile in the wilderness. This feeling it was—not any hostility to life as life, or to life’s duties—which led the Apostle to speak of Christians as strangers and pilgrims, and of the Church as another Israel, whom a greater than Moses or Joshua was conducting to a land of better promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/4-8.htm" title="For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.">Hebrews 4:8-9</a>). The woman, the representative of the Church, has a place prepared by God for her in the wilderness; she is not altogether uncared for; she has a place prepared, and nourishment. God provides her with a tabernacle of safety (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>), and with the true Bread “which came down from heaven” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-15.htm" title="And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.">Exodus 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-24.htm" title="And had rained down manna on them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.">Psalm 78:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-49.htm" title="Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.">John 6:49-50</a>), and with the living water from the Rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-3.htm" title="And did all eat the same spiritual meat;">1Corinthians 10:3-4</a>). The time of the sojourn in the wilderness is twelve hundred and sixty days, a period corresponding in length to the forty-two months during which the witnesses prophesied; it is the period of the Church’s witness against predominant evil. Driven forth, her voice, though but as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, is lifted up on behalf of righteousness and truth.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-6 The church, under the emblem of a woman, the mother of believers, was seen by the apostle in vision, in heaven. She was clothed with the sun, justified, sanctified, and shining by union with Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. The moon was under her feet; she was superior to the reflected and feebler light of the revelation made by Moses. Having on her head a crown of twelve stars; the doctrine of the gospel, preached by the twelve apostles, is a crown of glory to all true believers. As in pain to bring forth a holy family; desirous that the conviction of sinners might end in their conversion. A dragon is a known emblem of Satan, and his chief agents, or those who govern for him on earth, at that time the pagan empire of Rome, the city built upon seven hills. As having ten horns, divided into ten kingdoms. Having seven crowns, representing seven forms of government. As drawing with his tail a third part of the stars in heaven, and casting them down to the earth; persecuting and seducing the ministers and teachers. As watchful to crush the Christian religion; but in spite of the opposition of enemies, the church brought forth a manly issue of true and faithful professors, in whom Christ was truly formed anew; even the mystery of Christ, that Son of God who should rule the nations, and in whose right his members partake the same glory. This blessed offspring was protected of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the woman - The woman representing the church. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>.<p>Fled - That is, she fled in the manner, and at the time, stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>. John here evidently anticipates, by a summary statement, what he relates more in detail in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14-17</a>. He had referred <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-2.htm">Revelation 12:2-5</a> to what occurred to the child in its persecutions, and he here alludes, in general, to what befell the true church as compelled to flee into obscurity and safety. Having briefly referred to this, the writer <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-13</a> gives an account of the efforts of Satan consequent on the removal of the child to heaven.<p>Into the wilderness - On the meaning of the word "wilderness" in the New Testament, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>. It means a desert place, a place where there are few or no inhabitants; a place, therefore, where one might be concealed and unknown - remote from the habitations and the observations of people. This would well represent the fact, that the true church became for a time obscure and unknown - as if it had fled away from the habitations of people, and had retired to the solitude and loneliness of a desert. Yet even there <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-16.htm">Revelation 12:16</a> it would be mysteriously nourished, though seemingly driven out into wastes and solitudes, and having its abode among the rocks and sands of a desert.<p>Where she hath a place prepared of God - A place where she might be safe, and might be kept alive. The meaning is, that during that time the true church, though obscure and almost unknown, would be the object of the divine protection and care - a beautiful representation of the church during the corruptions of the papacy and the darkness of the middle ages.<p>That they should feed her - That they should "nourish" or "sustain" her -  &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  trepho&#772;sin - to wit, as specified in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-16.htm">Revelation 12:16</a>. Those who were to do this, represented by the word "they," are not particularly mentioned, and the simple idea is that she would be nourished during that time. That is, stripped of the figure, the church during that time would find true friends, and would be kept alive. It is hardly necessary to say that this has, in fact, occurred in the darkest periods of the history of the church.<p>A thousand two hundred and threescore days - That is, regarding these as prophetic days, in which a day denotes a year, twelve hundred and sixty years. The same period evidently is referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>, in the words "for a time, and times, and half a time." And the same period is undoubtedly referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; "And they shall be given into his hand until a time, and times, and the dividing of time." For a full consideration of the meaning of this language, and its application to the papacy, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. The full investigation there made of the meaning and application of the language renders its consideration here unnecessary. I regard it here, as I do there, as referring to the proper continuance of the papal power, during which the true church would remain in comparative obscurity, as if driven into a desert. Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>. The meaning here is, that during that period the true church would not become wholly extinct. It would have an existence upon the earth, but its final triumph would be reserved for the time when this great enemy should be finally overthrown.

But A and B add "there."<p>a place&#8212;that portion of the heathen world which has received Christianity professedly, namely, mainly the fourth kingdom, having its seat in the modern Babylon, Rome, implying that all the heathen world would not be Christianized in the present order of things.<p>prepared of God&#8212;literally, "from God." Not by human caprice or fear, but by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, the woman, the Church, fled into the wilderness.<p>they should feed her&#8212;Greek, "nourish her." Indefinite for, "she should be fed." The heathen world, the wilderness, could not nourish the Church, but only afford her an outward shelter. Here, as in Da 4:26, and elsewhere, the third person plural refers to the heavenly powers who minister from God nourishment to the Church. As Israel had its time of first bridal love, on its first going out of Egypt into the wilderness, so the Christian Church's wilderness-time of first love was the apostolic age, when it was separate from the Egypt of this world, having no city here, but seeking one to come; having only a place in the wilderness prepared of God (Re 12:6, 14). The harlot takes the world city as her own, even as Cain was the first builder of a city, whereas the believing patriarchs lived in tents. Then apostate Israel was the harlot and the young Christian Church the woman; but soon spiritual fornication crept in, and the Church in the seventeenth chapter is no longer the woman, but the harlot, the great Babylon, which, however, has in it hidden the true people of God (Re 18:4). The deeper the Church penetrated into heathendom, the more she herself became heathenish. Instead of overcoming, she was overcome by the world [Auberlen]. Thus, the woman is "the one inseparable Church of the Old and New Testament" [Hengstenberg], the stock of the Christian Church being Israel (Christ and His apostles being Jews), on which the Gentile believers have been grafted, and into which Israel, on her conversion, shall be grafted, as into her own olive tree. During the whole Church-historic period, or "times of the Gentiles," wherein "Jerusalem is trodden down of the Gentiles," there is no believing Jewish Church, and therefore, only the Christian Church can be "the woman." At the same time there is meant, secondarily, the preservation of the Jews during this Church-historic period, in order that Israel, who was once "the woman," and of whom the man-child was born, may become so again at the close of the Gentile times, and stand at the head of the two elections, literal Israel, and spiritual Israel, the Church elected from Jews and Gentiles without distinction. Eze 20:35, 36, "I will bring you into the wilderness of the people (Hebrew, 'peoples'), and there will I plead with you &#8230; like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of Egypt" (compare Notes, see on [2716]Eze 20:35, 36): not a wilderness literally and locally, but spiritually a state of discipline and trial among the Gentile "peoples," during the long Gentile times, and one finally consummated in the last time of unparalleled trouble under Antichrist, in which the sealed remnant (Re 7:1-8) who constitute "the woman," are nevertheless preserved "from the face of the serpent" (Re 12:14).<p>thousand two hundred and threescore days&#8212;anticipatory of Re 12:14, where the persecution which caused her to flee is mentioned in its place: Re 13:11-18 gives the details of the persecution. It is most unlikely that the transition should be made from the birth of Christ to the last Antichrist, without notice of the long intervening Church-historical period. Probably the 1260 days, or periods, representing this long interval, are RECAPITULATED on a shorter scale analogically during the last Antichrist's short reign. They are equivalent to three and a half years, which, as half of the divine number seven, symbolize the seeming victory of the world over the Church. As they include the whole Gentile times of Jerusalem's being trodden of the Gentiles, they must be much longer than 1260 years; for, above several centuries more than 1260 years have elapsed since Jerusalem fell.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And the woman fled into the wilderness:</span> as the Israelites, when they fled from Pharaoh, went into the wilderness; and Joseph, watched upon by Herod, fled into Egypt; so the church did hide herself during the antichristian persecutions, every one shifting for themselves as well as they could. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Where she hath a place prepared of God; </span> God provided for them in some more obscure places. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the woman fled into the wilderness,....

As interpretations, they are excluded if we admit that she is the ancient Israel: though applications and illustrations drawn from one may be appropriate to the other. On the view taken here, the doctrine of this chapter is analogous to that of Romans 11, though the point of view is not quite the same. St Paul distinguishes a double fulfilment of God’s promises to Israel—“the Election,” the believing minority, receive them now, and “all Israel shall be saved” at last. St John does not distinguish the two, but uses language that covers both. The Daughter of Zion is kept alive by God, <span class="ital">both</span> in the continued quasi-national life of the Jewish people, and in the number (be it large or small) of Christians of Jewish race; who are known to God, though for 1500 years at least they have, as a community, disappeared in the mass of their Gentile fellow-believers. It is hardly necessary to contradict the utterly unhistorical theory, that any now existing Christian nation can be identified with a portion of Israel. The theory is perhaps most absurd when applied to the English, whose ancestors are mentioned as a pagan tribe of north Germany, within 30 years, if not within three of the date of this vision.

B.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the woman fled into the wilderness.</span> As with Christ, so with his Church. His great trial took place in the wilderness; so the trial of the Church occurs in the wilderness, by which figure the world is typified. It is generally pointed out that this verse is here inserted in anticipation of ver. 14. We prefer rather to look upon it as occurring in its natural place, the narrative being interrupted by vers. 7-13 in order to account for the implacable hostility of the devil. <span class="cmt_word">Where she hath a place prepared of God</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, P, and others insert <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> as well as <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "where she there hath," etc. - a redundancy which is an ordinary Hebraism. Though the Church is "in the world," she is not "of the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14, 15</a>); though the woman is in the "wilderness," her place is "prepared of God." The harlot's abode (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>.) is in the wilderness, and it is also of the wilderness; it is not in a place specially prepared of God. <span class="cmt_word">That they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days.</span> The sense is the same as in ver. 14, "that she should be sustained there." The interpretation of the 1260 days, or 3.5 years, coincides here with that adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>. It describes the period of this world's existence, during the whole of which the devil persecutes the Church of God. As Auberlen points out, this is, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>, declared to be "the period of the power of the beast, that is, the world power." (For a discussion of the whole subject of this period, see on Revelation 11:2.) <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of God (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Lit., from God, the preposition marking the source from which the preparation came.
