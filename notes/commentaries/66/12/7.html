It has afforded material for many poetic fancies, and has been the occasion of much speculative interpretation. We shall fail to catch the spirit of its meaning if we insist upon detaching the passage from its context; and the more so that the structure of the chapter seems to give an express warning against doing so. The narrative of the woman’s flight into the wilderness is suspended that this passage may be inserted. Could we have a clearer indication of the anxiety of the sacred writer to connect this war in heaven with the birth and rapture of the man child? The man child is born; born a conqueror. The dragon is His foe, and the powers of the foe are not confined to the material and historical world: he is a power in the world spiritual; but the man child is to be entirely a conqueror. His rapture into heaven is the announcement that there, in the very highest, He is acknowledged victor; and His victory is won over the power of the dragon, the old serpent, whose head is now bruised. “The prince of this world cometh,” said Jesus Christ, “and hath nothing in Me.” “Now is the judgment of this world; now is the prince of this world cast out. And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me.” Do we need more? There is mystery—unexplained mystery, perhaps—about this war in heaven, but there need be none about the general occasion referred to; it is the overthrow of the evil one by Christ: the death-blow given by the Lord of Life to him who had the power of death; it is the victory of Bethlehem, Calvary, and Olivet which is commemorated, and the effects of which are seen to transcend the sphere of the things seen. But why have we Michael and his angels introduced? This may be one of those unexplained mysteries referred to above. Some, indeed, think that this Michael is a designation of our Lord Himself, and of Him alone; but a consideration of the other passages in which Michael is mentioned (notably, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm" title="But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.">Daniel 10:13</a>, where Michael is called “one of the chief princes”) leaves this limited meaning doubtful, and almost suggests conflict among the spiritual hierarchies. It may, however, be the case that the name <span class= "ital">Michael</span>—the meaning of which is, “who is like unto God”—is a general name applied to any who for the moment represent the cause of God in the great conflict against evil. It may thus belong, not to any one angel being, but be a kind of type-name used for the champion and prince of God’s people, and so employed in this passage to denote Him who is the Captain of our salvation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,...">Revelation 12:7-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And there was war in heaven, </span>&c. — It might reasonably be presumed that all the powers of idolatry would be strenuously exerted against the establishment of Christianity, and especially against the establishment of a Christian on the imperial throne: and these struggles and contentions between the heathen and the Christian religions are here represented by <span class="ital">war in heaven, </span>between the angels of darkness and angels of light.

The visible actors in the cause of Christianity were the believing emperors and ministers of the word, the martyrs and confessors; and in support of idolatry, were the persecuting emperors and heathen magistrates, together with the whole train of priests and sophists. This contest lasted several years, and the final issue of it was, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/12-8.htm" title="And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven....">Revelation 12:8-9</a>,) that the Christian prevailed over the heathen religion; the heathen were deposed from all rule and authority, and the Christians were advanced to dominion and empire in their stead. Our Saviour said unto his disciples casting devils out of the bodies of men, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-18.htm" title="And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.">Luke 10:18</a>,) <span class="ital">I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. </span>In the same figure Satan fell from heaven: and <span class="ital">was cast out into the earth </span>— When he was thrust out of the imperial throne; <span class="ital">and his angels were cast out with him </span>— Not only all the heathen priests and officers, civil and military, were cashiered, but their very gods and demons, who before were adored, became the subjects of contempt and execration. It is very remarkable that Constantine himself, and the Christians of his time, described his conquests under the same image, as if they had understood that this prophecy had received its accomplishment in him. Moreover, a picture of Constantine was set up over the palace gate, with the cross over his head, and under his feet <span class="ital">the great enemy of mankind, who persecuted the church by the means of impious tyrants, in the form of a dragon, </span>transfixed with a dart through the midst of his body, and falling headlong into the depth of the sea: in allusion, it is said expressly, to the divine oracles in the books of the prophets, where that evil spirit is called the dragon, and the crooked serpent. Upon this victory of the church there is introduced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm" title="And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.">Revelation 12:10</a>) a triumphant hymn of thanksgiving for the depression of idolatry and exaltation of true religion. It was not by temporal means or arms that the Christians obtained this victory, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-11.htm" title="And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.">Revelation 12:11</a>,) but by spiritual; by the merits and death of their Redeemer, by their constant profession of the truth, and by their patient suffering of all kinds of tortures, even unto death: and the blood of the martyrs hath been often called <span class="ital">the seed of the church. </span>This victory was indeed matter of joy and triumph to the blessed angels and glorified saints in heaven, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-12.htm" title="Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you that dwell in them.

The seat of this war was in heaven; in the church of Christ, the kingdom of heaven on earth. The parties were Christ, the great Angel of the covenant, and his faithful followers; and Satan and his instruments. The strength of the church is in having the Lord Jesus for the Captain of their salvation. Pagan idolatry, which was the worship of devils, was cast out of the empire by the spreading of Christianity. The salvation and strength of the church, are only to be ascribed to the King and Head of the church. The conquered enemy hates the presence of God, yet he is willing to appear there, to accuse the people of God. Let us take heed that we give him no cause to accuse us; and that, when we have sinned, we go before the Lord, condemn ourselves, and commit our cause to Christ as our Advocate. The servants of God overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb, as the cause. By the word of their testimony: the powerful preaching of the gospel is mighty, through God, to pull down strong holds. By their courage and patience in sufferings: they loved not their lives so well but they could lay them down in Christ's cause. These were the warriors and the weapons by which Christianity overthrew the power of pagan idolatry; and if Christians had continued to fight with these weapons, and such as these, their victories would have been more numerous and glorious, and the effects more lasting. The redeemed overcame by a simple reliance on the blood of Christ, as the only ground of their hopes. In this we must be like them. We must not blend any thing else with this.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there was war in heaven - There was a state of things existing in regard to the woman and the child - the church in the condition in which it would then be - which would be well represented by a war in heaven; that is, by a conflict between the powers of good and evil, of light and darkness. Of course it is not necessary to understand this literally, anymore than the other symbolical representations in the book. All that is meant is, that a vision passed before the mind of John as if there was a conflict, in regard to the church, between the angels in heaven and Satan. There is a vision of the persecuted church - of the woman fleeing into the desert - and the course of the narrative is here interrupted by going back <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-13</a> to describe the conflict which led to this result, and the fact that Satan, as it were cast out of heaven, and unable to achieve a victory there, was suffered to vent his malice against the church on earth. The seat of this warfare is said to be heaven. This language sometimes refers to heaven as it appears to us - the sky - the upper regions of the atmosphere, and some have supposed that that was the place of the contest. But the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a> (see the notes on those places), would rather lead us to refer it to heaven considered as lying beyond the sky. This accords, too, with other representations in the Bible, where Satan is described as appearing before God, and among the sons of God. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>. Of course this is not to be understood as a real transaction, but as a symbolical representation of the contest between good and evil - as if there was a war waged in heaven between Satan and the leader of the heavenly hosts.<p>Michael - There have been very various opinions as to who Michael is. Many Protestant interpreters have supposed that Christ is meant. The reasons usually alleged for this opinion, many of which are very fanciful, may be seen in Hengstenberg (Die Offenbarung des heiliges Johannes), 1:611-622. The reference to Michael here is probably derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>. In those places he is represented as the guardian angel of the people of God; and it is in this sense, I apprehend, that the passage is to be understood here. There is no evidence in the name itself, or in the circumstances referred to, that Christ is intended; and if he had been, it is inconceivable why he was not referred to by his own name, or by some of the usual appellations which John gives him. Michael, the archangel, is here represented as the guardian of the church, and as contending against Satan for its protection. Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>. This representation accords with the usual statements in the Bible respecting the interposition of the angels in behalf of the church (see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), and is one which cannot be proved to be unfounded. All the analogies which throw any light on the subject, as well as the uniform statements of the Bible, lead us to suppose that good beings of other worlds feel an interest in the welfare of the redeemed church below.<p>And his angels - The angels under him. Michael is represented as the archangel, and all the statements in the Bible suppose that the heavenly hosts are distributed into different ranks and orders. See the Jde 1:9 note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a> note. If Satan is permitted to make war against the church, there is no improbability in supposing that, in those higher regions where the war is carried on, and in those aspects of it which lie beyond the power and the knowledge of man, good angels should be employed to defeat his plans.<p>Fought - See the notes on Jde 1:9.<p>Against the dragon - Against Satan. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>.<p>And the dragon fought and his angels - That is, the master-spirit - Satan, and those under him. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>. Of the nature of this warfare nothing is definitely stated. Its whole sphere lies beyond mortal vision, and is carried on in a manner of which we can have little conception. What weapons Satan may use to destroy the church, and in what way his efforts may be counteracted by holy angels, are points on which we can have little knowledge. It is sufficient to know that the fact of such a struggle is not improbable, and that Satan is successfully resisted by the leader of the heavenly host. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. In Job 1:6-11; 2:1-6, Satan appears among the sons of God, presenting himself before God in heaven, as the accuser of the saints: again in Zec 3:1, 2. But at Christ's coming as our Redeemer, he fell from heaven, especially when Christ suffered, rose again, and ascended to heaven. When Christ appeared before God as our Advocate, Satan, the accusing adversary, could no longer appear before God against us, but was cast out judicially (Ro 8:33, 34). He and his angels henceforth range through the air and the earth, after a time (namely, the interval between the ascension and the second advent) about to be cast hence also, and bound in hell. That "heaven" here does not mean merely the air, but the abode of angels, appears from Re 12:9, 10, 12; 1Ki 22:19-22.<p>there was&#8212;Greek, "there came to pass," or "arose."<p>war in heaven&#8212;What a seeming contradiction in terms, yet true! Contrast the blessed result of Christ's triumph, Lu 19:38, "peace in heaven." Col 1:20, "made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself; whether &#8230; things in earth, or things in heaven."<p>Michael and his angels &#8230; the dragon &#8230; and his angels&#8212;It was fittingly ordered that, as the rebellion arose from unfaithful angels and their leader, so they should be encountered and overcome by faithful angels and their archangel, in heaven. On earth they are fittingly encountered, and shall be overcome, as represented by the beast and false prophet, by the Son of man and His armies of human saints (Re 19:14-21). The conflict on earth, as in Da 10:13, has its correspondent conflict of angels in heaven. Michael is peculiarly the prince, or presiding angel, of the Jewish nation. The conflict in heaven, though judicially decided already against Satan from the time of Christ's resurrection and ascension, receives its actual completion in the execution of judgment by the angels who cast out Satan from heaven. From Christ's ascension he has no standing-ground judicially against the believing elect. Lu 10:18, "I beheld (in the earnest of the future full fulfilment given in the subjection of the demons to the disciples) Satan as lightning fall from heaven." As Michael fought before with Satan about the body of the mediator of the old covenant (Jude 9), so now the mediator of the new covenant, by offering His sinless body in sacrifice, arms Michael with power to renew and finish the conflict by a complete victory. That Satan is not yet actually and finally cast out of heaven, though the judicial sentence to that effect received its ratification at Christ's ascension, appears from Eph 6:12, "spiritual wickedness in high (Greek, 'heavenly') places." This is the primary Church-historical sense here. But, through Israel's unbelief, Satan has had ground against that, the elect nation, appearing before God as its accuser. At the eve of its restoration, in the ulterior sense, his standing-ground in heaven against Israel, too, shall be taken from him, "the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem" rebuking him, and casting him out from heaven actually and for ever by Michael, the prince, or presiding angel of the Jews. Thus Zec 3:1-9 is strictly parallel, Joshua, the high priest, being representative of his nation Israel, and Satan standing at God's fight hand as adversary to resist Israel's justification. Then, and not till then, fully (Re 12:10, "NOW," &c.) shall ALL things be reconciled unto Christ IN HEAVEN (Col 1:20), and there shall be peace in heaven (Lu 19:38).<p>against&#8212;A, B, and C read, "with."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And there was war in heaven:</span> by <span class="ital">heaven, </span> in this place, doubtless is meant the church of God; and supposing that the pagan emperors are to be understood by the <span class="ital">dragon, </span>( which is pretty generally agreed), there can be no great doubt, but by this <span class="ital">war in heaven, </span> is to be understood those persecutions which the primitive church endured between the years 64 and 310. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon</span> <span class="ital">fought and his angels:</span> the two parties were the pagan emperors, and their officers, and party, and <span class="ital">Michael and his angels.</span> But who is here meant by <span class="ital">Michael and his angels?</span> Some, by this <span class="ital">Michael, </span> understand a principal angel called <span class="ital">the archangel, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-9.htm" title="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Judges 1:9</a></span>, <span class="ital">one of the chief princes, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm" title="But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.">Daniel 10:13</a></span>.

The matter is not much; it is most certain that the battle is not ours, but Christ’s.

Not in the third heaven, the habitation of God, the seat of the angels and glorified saints, there is no discord, jars, and contentions there, nothing but peace, love, and joy; but in the church below, which is militant, and has in it as it were a company of two armies; or rather in the Roman empire, which was the heaven of Satan, the god of this world, and of his angels; and this war refers not to the dispute between Michael the archangel and the devil about the body of Moses, Jde 1:9; nor to the of the angels when they rebelled against God, left their first estate, and were cast down to hell, Jde 1:6; nor to that ancient and stated enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, which has appeared in all ages of time, more or less, since the fall of Adam; nor to the combats which Christ personally had with Satan and his powers when here on earth, as in the wilderness, immediately after his baptism, and in the garden, a little before his death, and on the cross, when he spoiled principalities and powers, and destroyed him that had the power of death, the devil; but rather to the conflict which Christ and his people had with the rulers of the darkness of this world, with the Roman powers, and with false teachers during the three first centuries; though it seems best to understand it of the war commenced by Constantine against Paganism, and which was finished by Theodosius, by whom Heathenism received its death wound, and was never restored since the phrase of war in heaven is not unknown to the Jews; they say (i) when Pharaoh pursued after Israel, there was war above and below, and there was a very fierce war  "in heaven": <p>Michael and his angels fought against the dragon: by whom is meant not a created angel, with whom his name does not agree, it signifying "who is as God"; nor does it appear that there is anyone created angel that presides over the rest, and has them at his command; though the Jews seem to imagine as if the angels were ranged under several heads and governors, of whom they make Michael to be one; for they say (k), <p>"when the holy blessed God descended on Mount Sinai, several companies of angels descended with him, , "Michael and his company", and Gabriel and his company:'' <p>"so kings armies", in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm">Psalm 68:12</a>; are by them interpreted of "kings of angels"; and it is asked who are these? and the answer is, Michael and Gabriel (l). Lord Napier thinks that the Holy Ghost is designed, who is equally truly God as the Father and the Son, and who in the hearts of the saints opposes Satan and his temptations; but it seems best to interpret it of Jesus Christ, who is equal with God, is his fellow, is one with the Father, and in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily: he is the Archangel, the first of the chief princes, the head of all principality and power, who is on the side of the Lord's people, pleads their cause, defends their persons, and saves them; see Jde 1:9; and by "his angels" may be meant either the good angels, literally understood, who are his creatures, his ministers, and whom he employs under him, in protecting his people, and in destroying his enemies; or else the ministers of the Gospel, who are called angels in this book, and who, under Christ, fight the good fight of faith, contend earnestly for it, being valiant for the truth upon earth; or rather the Christian emperors, particularly Constantine and Theodosius, and the Christians with them, who opposed Paganism in the empire, and at last subdued, and cast it out: <p>and the dragon fought, and his angels; there is such an order among the evil angels, as to have one of their own at the head of them, they having cast off their allegiance to God and Christ, who is styled the prince of devils, and his name is Beelzebub: hence we read of the devil and his angels; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>; and these may be intended here, unless false teachers, who transform themselves into angels of light, as their leader sometimes does, should be thought to be meant, who resist the truth and oppose themselves to the ministers of it; though rather, Satan as presiding over, and influencing the Roman Pagan empire, and the Roman emperors, who acted under him, are here designed; with whom Constantine and Theodosius, under Christ, combated, such as Maximinus, Maxentius, Licinius, Arbogastes, and Eugenius, and those that were with them.

The idea, also, that the dragon also made only the attempt to seize the child from God’s own hand, is in itself not possible. But in the struggle which now arises, it is not Satan, but Michael, who appears as taking the offensive.

In this passage, also, Michael the archangel[3084] appears as the leader of the angelic army (<span class="greekheb">καὶ οἱ ἄγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτου</span>), with which he contends for the Messiah and his kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ πολεμῆσαι μετὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δράκ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Just as undoubted as is this reading according to the MSS. at hand, is its obscurity in a grammatical respect; since the gen. infinitive <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πολεμῆσαι</span>, in connection with the words <span class="greekheb">ὁ Μιχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ οἱ ἄγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτου</span>, is without all analogy in the Greek of the LXX. and the N.

The seeming parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-25.htm" title="And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.">Acts 10:25</a>, is distinguished from this passage by the very fact that there a proper grammatical reason is present,[3085] while in this passage the connection of the gen. infinitive <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πολεμῆσαι</span> with the subj. <span class="greekheb">ὁ Μιχ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., admits of no grammatical explanation whatever; for neither the analogy of passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-14.htm" title="He hews him down cedars, and takes the cypress and the oak, which he strengthens for himself among the trees of the forest: he plants an ash, and the rain does nourish it.">Isaiah 44:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-5.htm" title="And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: where the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for you shall overtake them.">Joshua 2:5</a>, is applicable where the inf., introduced by <span class="greekheb">לֶ</span>, stands in definite dependence upon a preceding idea, and where the LXX. also place a finite tense,[3086] nor is the supplying of the words “had war,” upon which, then, the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πολεμ</span>. is regarded as dependent,[3087] allowable. If it were possible from the <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο πόλεμος</span> to supply an <span class="greekheb">ἐγένοντο</span> before <span class="greekheb">ὁ Μιχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καί οἱ ἀγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>.,[3088] or if the <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span> dare be regarded as extending to <span class="greekheb">ὁ Μιχ</span>.,[3089] the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πολεμῆσαι</span> would then be correctly added.[3090] But that twofold conception is so doubtful as to constrain us to the opinion that our text is defective or corrupt.[3091] As a sensible conjecture, the Elz. reading, <span class="greekheb">ἐπολέμησαν</span>, commends itself, since the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ</span> before the infin. may be repeated from the preceding <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, and the change of the <span class="greekheb">πολεμῆσαι</span> into the form of a finite tense is without difficulty; but if the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πολεμῆσαι</span> of the MSS. be correct,—and its difficulty favors it,—a finite tense immediately before, upon which this <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πολεμ</span>. depends, may have fallen out, possibly <span class="greekheb">ἀνέστησαν</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἦλθαν</span>, or the like, since the essential meaning is manifestly that which the versions express.[3092] The conjecture is most probable, that the words <span class="greekheb">πόλεμος ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ</span> are nothing but a marginal note that has entered into the text, made in order to mark the noteworthy contents of the passage;[3093] if these words be regarded as absent, the connection of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟΎ ΠΟΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> with the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΓΈΝΕΤΟ Ὁ ΜΙΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΟἹ ἌΓΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span> does not seem difficult, since the genitive of the telic infinitive[3094] correctly depends upon the idea of the movement lying in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΕΝΕΤΟ</span></span></span>.[3095] This conjecture has in its favor, that the reception into the text of the doubtful words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΌΛΕΜΟς ἘΝ Τῷ ΟὐΡΑΝῷ</span></span></span> is incomparably more probable than the falling-out of a finite tense before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῪ ΠΟΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>; it is also to be considered, that, as in what follows, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΟΛΈΜΗΣΕ</span></span></span> is formed only according to the chief subject <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΔΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, the same phraseology is probable also in the first clause. Moreover, while it would have been difficult for John to have written <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΜΙΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ΟἹ ἌΓΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΑὐΤΟῦ ἘΠΟΛΈΜΗΣΕ</span></span></span>,—for the sing., after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΟἹ ἌΓΓΕΛΟΙ ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span> had preceded, would have been unallowable in the style of the Apoc., and besides, in connection with the following, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΟΛΈΜΗΣΕ</span></span></span> appears to be still more monotonous than the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΟΛΈΜΗΣΑΝ</span></span></span> even of the Rec.,—the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΈΝΕΤΟ</span></span></span>, on the other hand, in immediate connection with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΜΙΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ΟἹ ἌΓΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> meets all requirements, and commends itself especially by the fact that it gives the meaning that the attack proceeded from Michael and his angels.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3082] Eichh., Herd., De Wette, Stern.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3083] Beda: “In the <span class="ital">Church</span>, in which he says that Michael with his angels fights against the devil, because, by praying and ministering his aid, he contends, according to God’s will, for the wandering Church.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3084] Beng., Ew., De Wette, Hofm., Ebrard, Auberlen, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3085] As the genitive infinitive clause, in which the subject enters as an accus.

The passage vers. 7-13 is an interruption of the narrative of the persecution of the woman by Satan. It is caused, apparently, by a desire to account in some degree for the relentless hostility of the devil towards God and his Church. Two explanations of the passage may be referred to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Vers. 7-13 relate to the period anterior to the Creation, concerning which we have a slight hint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>. This, on the whole, seems to agree best with the general sense of the chapter, and to present fewest difficulties. Thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> It accounts for the insertion of the passage (see above). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The war is directly between the devil and Michael, not between the devil and Christ, as at the Incarnation and Resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Vers. 8 and 9 seem to require a more literal interpretation than that which makes them refer to the effects of Christ's resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> It was not at the period of the Incarnation that the scene of Satan's opposition was transferred to the earth, as described in ver. 12. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The song of the heavenly voice may be intended to end with the word Christ (ver. 10), and the following passages may be the words of the writer of the Apocalypse, and may refer to the earthly martyrs (see on ver. 10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> This attempt of the devil in heaven may be alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, "The darkness overcame it not" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The passage may refer to the incarnation and resurrection of Christ, and the victory then won over the devil. This interpretation renders the whole passage much more figurative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Michael is the type of mankind, which in the Person of Jesus Christ vanquishes the devil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Subsequent to the Resurrection Satan is no more allowed to accuse men before God in heaven, as he has done previously (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1.htm">Job 1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-22</a>); he is thus the accuser cast down (ver. 10), and his place is no more found in heaven (ver. 8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The earth and sea represent the worldly and tumultuous nations. Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of the second view is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Michael and his angels fought against the dragon;</span> <span class="accented">Michael and his angels</span> [<span class="accented">going forth</span>] <span class="accented">to war with the dragon</span> (Revised Version). Alford explains the infinitive phrase as compounded of the genitive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and depending upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. <span class="accented">Michael</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5db;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>) signifies, "Who is like to God?" We may compare this with the cry of the worldly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-4.htm">Revelation 13:4</a>, "Who is like unto the beast?" In Daniel, <span class="accented">Michael</span> is the prince who stands up for the people of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 21</a>). <span class="accented">Michael</span>, "the archangel," is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a> as the great opposer of Satan. St. John, perhaps borrowing the name from Daniel, puts forward <span class="accented">Michael as</span> the chief of those who remained faithful to the cause of God in the rebellion of Satan and his angels. The <span class="accented">angels</span> of the dragon are the stars of ver. 4, which he drew with him to the earth, and possibly the reference to this event in ver. 4 gives rise to the account in vers. 7-13. Some commentators interpret the war here described as that between the Church and the world. <span class="accented">Michael</span> is thus made to be symbolical of Christ, and some have no difficulty in indicating a particular man (such as Licinius) as the antitype of the dragon. <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</span> The Greek is stronger, <span class="accented">not even their place</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, Andreas, Arethas; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is found in P, 1, 17, and others.
