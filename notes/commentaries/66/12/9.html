The stronger than the strong one has come, and taken away his armour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-21.htm" title="When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace:">Luke 11:21-22</a>). The death-blow is given. The prince of this world (who found nothing in Christ) is judged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm" title="Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.">John 16:11</a>). The adversary is described as the dragon, the fierce and cruel foe who is ever ready to devour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>). <span class= "ital">The ancient serpent.</span> The serpent was used as an emblem of the evil principle. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm" title="Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, Yes, has God said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?">Genesis 3:1</a>). But the head of the ancient foe of man is now bruised: he is the devil, the accuser and calumniator. He is called the accuser of the brethren in the next verse; he is Satan, the adversary, and he is the seducer, the deceiver, as he is a liar, and the father of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:7-11 The attempts of the dragon proved unsuccessful against the church, and fatal to his own interests. The seat of this war was in heaven; in the church of Christ, the kingdom of heaven on earth. The parties were Christ, the great Angel of the covenant, and his faithful followers; and Satan and his instruments. The strength of the church is in having the Lord Jesus for the Captain of their salvation. Pagan idolatry, which was the worship of devils, was cast out of the empire by the spreading of Christianity. The salvation and strength of the church, are only to be ascribed to the King and Head of the church. The conquered enemy hates the presence of God, yet he is willing to appear there, to accuse the people of God. Let us take heed that we give him no cause to accuse us; and that, when we have sinned, we go before the Lord, condemn ourselves, and commit our cause to Christ as our Advocate. The servants of God overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb, as the cause. By the word of their testimony: the powerful preaching of the gospel is mighty, through God, to pull down strong holds. By their courage and patience in sufferings: they loved not their lives so well but they could lay them down in Christ's cause. These were the warriors and the weapons by which Christianity overthrew the power of pagan idolatry; and if Christians had continued to fight with these weapons, and such as these, their victories would have been more numerous and glorious, and the effects more lasting. The redeemed overcame by a simple reliance on the blood of Christ, as the only ground of their hopes. In this we must be like them. We must not blend any thing else with this.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the great dragon was cast out - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>. That there may be an allusion in the language here to what actually occurred in some far distant period of the past, when Satan was ejected from heaven, there can be no reason to doubt. Our Saviour seems to refer to such an event in the language which he uses when he says <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven"; and Jude, perhaps <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>, may refer to the same event. All that we know on the subject leads us to suppose that at some time there was a revolt among the angels, and that the rebellious part were cast out of heaven, for an allusion to this is not infrequent in the Scriptures. Still the event here referred to is a symbolical representation of what could occur at a later period, when the church would be about to spread and he triumphant, and when Satan would wage a deadly war against it. That opposition would be as if he made war on Michael the archangel, and the heavenly hosts, and his failure would be as great as if he were vanquished and cast out of heaven.<p>That old serpent - This doubtless refers to the serpent that deceived Eve (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>; compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>); and this passage may be adduced as a proof that the real tempter of Eve was the devil, who assumed the form of a serpent. The word "old" here refers to the fact that his appearance on earth was at an early stage of the world's history, and that he had long been employed in the work which is here attributed to him - that of opposing the church.<p>Called the devil - To whom the name devil is given. That is, this is the same being that is elsewhere and commonly known by that name. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>.<p>And Satan - Another name given to the same being - a name, like the other, designed to refer to something in his character. See it explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>.<p>Which deceiveth the whole world - Whose character is that of a deceiver; whose agency extends over all the earth. See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a> note.<p>He was cast out into the earth - That is, he was not suffered to pursue his designs in heaven, but was cast down to the earth, where he is permitted for a time to carry on his warfare against the church. According to the interpretation proposed above, this refers to the period when there were indications that God was about to set up his kingdom on the earth. The language, however, is such as would be used on the supposition that there had been, at some period, a rebellion in heaven, and that Satan and his followers had been cast out to return there no more. It is difficult to explain this language except on that supposition; and such a supposition is, in itself, no more improbable than the apostasy and rebellion of man.<p>And his angels were cast out with him - They shared the lot of their leader. As applicable to the state of things to which this refers, the meaning is, that all were overthrown; that no enemy of the church would remain unsubdued; that the victory would be final and complete. As applicable to the event from which the language is supposed to have been derived - the revolt in heaven - the meaning is, that the followers in the revolt shared the lot of the leader, and that all who rebelled were ejected from heaven. The first and the only revolt in heaven was quelled; and the result furnished to the universe an impressive proof that none who rebelled there would be forgiven - that apostasy so near the throne could not be pardoned. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. that old serpent&#8212;alluding to Ge 3:1, 4.<p>Devil&#8212;the Greek, for "accuser," or "slanderer."<p>Satan&#8212;the Hebrew for "adversary," especially in a court of justice.

Mr. Mede understands it of the demons which the heathens worshipped as inferior gods. John, being in his trance still, thought he saw a great red dragon, (which he judged to be the devil), and Christ, or the good angels, fighting with and overcoming him; and that he saw the devil, and those evil angels assisting him, thrown down to the earth. This prophetically and typically signified; that though the Roman emperors, being pagans, should persecute the church upwards of three hundred years, yet they should be overthrown, and paganism, with all its idolatry and superstition, should be rooted out; which occasioned a great deal of glory to God from the praises and thanksgivings of his people, expressed in the next three verses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the great dragon was cast out,.... From heaven, or from power and authority in the Roman empire, namely, the devil, where he had long presided; it is observable that Constantine himself speaks of "the dragon" being removed from the government of the commonwealth by the providence of God, and by the ministry, or means of him (m); and he had his own effigies on a table placed before the porch of his palace, with the cross over his head, and a dragon under his feet thrust through with darts, and falling headlong (n); <p>the old serpent; who is so called, because, of old, from the beginning, almost as soon as the world was, he appeared in the form of a serpent, or rather made use of it as an instrument and means, by which he seduced Eve, and so brought on the ruin of mankind, it is very usual with the Jews to call the devil , "the old serpent" (o); wherefore John uses this phrase as a known one, to explain who was meant by the great dragon: <p>called the devil and Satan; the first of these names signifies an accuser, and a forger of calumnies, and such is the old serpent; he accuses God to men, as if he was envious of their happiness, as in the case of our first parents, and of men to God, of which there is an instance in the case of Job; and hence he is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a> called the accuser of the brethren; and the latter of them signifies an enemy, one that is filled with hatred and enmity to God and Christ, and to his church and people, whose adversary he is said to be, and at whose right hand he stands to resist, as he did Joshua the high priest: <p>which deceiveth the whole world; which he did by deceiving our first parents, from whom all mankind spring, and in whose loins they were when they were deceived; so the Jews say (p) of the old serpent, that  , "he deceives the whole world"; and so he deceived and corrupted the old world before the flood; and so he seduces every age and generation of men in the world; but here the Roman empire, sometimes called all the world, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>, is meant, whom Satan deceived by drawing it into idolatry and superstition; <p>he was cast out into the earth; he was cast out of the Roman empire, from the rule of it, and worship in it, the Heathen gods and Heathen emperors being no more; when he possessed and instigated, and influenced the Huns, Goths, and Vandals, a meaner and baser sort of people, hereafter in this chapter called the earth, which is said to help the woman, contrary to the intention of Satan; the phrase denotes the greatness of the fall of Satan, his loss of power, and the meanness and low estate of the persons he afterwards had the power of, both the savage people before mentioned, and the antichristian party: <p>and his angels were cast out with him; the Heathen emperors, magistrates, priests, and other votaries of his, which he made use of as instruments to do his will. <p>(m) Euseb. de Vita Constantini, l. 2. c. 46.

In Enoch xl. 7 we have it used in the plural in a passage very like this: “The fourth voice I heard expelling the Satans, and prohibiting them from coming into the presence of the Lord of spirits, to prefer accusations against the inhabitants of the earth.” The voice is afterwards explained to be that of Phanuel, the angel of penitence and hope.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he was cast out into the earth</span>] St <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-18.htm" title="And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.">Luke 10:18</a>, St <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a> throw light on what must be meant—a breaking of the power of the Devil by that of the Incarnate Lord: but we cannot be quite sure that our Lord speaks of the <span class="ital">same</span> fall of Satan in both passages, or in either of the same that St John describes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/revelation/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm" title="And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.">Revelation 12:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ καλούμενος διάβολος</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ σατανᾶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="ital">The devil</span> and <span class="ital">Satan</span> are exactly synonymous, as Druse teaches, and Raphel, in his Annot. from Polybius, p. 719; for both <span class="greekheb">שטן</span>, and <span class="greekheb">διαβάλλειν</span> mean to place one’ self between for the purpose of resistance; wherefore also the Septuagint frequently has <span class="greekheb">διάβολος</span> for <span class="greekheb">שטן</span>, which is retained at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1 Kings 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm" title="And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.">1 Kings 11:25</a>. Therefore there is no more difference between them than between gladius, in ordinary appellation, and ensis in poetic usage. The only difference lies in the Hebrew and Greek idiom; and the adversary is pointed out, who harasses the Gentiles, as the devil, and the Jews, as Satan; in this place, indeed, saints of both classes. Even Andreas of Cæsareia saw, that there was force in the double appellation; and lest I should be accused of refining too nicely, Grotius refers this double appellation to the Jews and Gentiles. But the observation appertains to this text, in which both the Hebrew and the Greek names are joined together: in other texts, even the appellation of the devil, inasmuch as it is alone, may no doubt appertain to the Jews.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ πλανῶν</span>, which deceiveth) The devil is a liar and a murderer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>; a seducer, in this passage, and raging, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-12.htm" title="Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time.">Revelation 12:12</a>, where despair, in consequence of the shortness of the time, inflames his rage.

"The dragon:" so called, because he is the destroyer (see on ver. 3). "The ancient serpent," as he was revealed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a> he is "the destroyer from the beginning." "The devil" (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is the Greek rendering of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Satan</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, "the accuser, the adversary;" reference is made in ver. 10 to the signification of the name, "The Deceiver." Wordsworth says, "The deceits by which Satan cheated the world in oracles, sorcery, soothsaying, magic, and other frauds, are here specially noticed. These were put to flight by the power of Christ and of the Holy Ghost, in the preaching of the gospel by the apostles and others in the first ages of Christianity. Our Lord himself, speaking of the consequence of the preaching of the seventy disciples, reveals the spiritual struggle and the victory: 'I was beholding Satan as lightning fall from heaven' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17, 18</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him;</span> <span class="accented">cast down to the earth</span>, etc. (Revised Version). "To the earth" in a twofold sense: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the phrase is a description of the loss of dignity and power on the part of Satan, in being cast to <span class="accented">earth</span> as opposed to heaven; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">earth</span> is the scene of his future operations, where he may still in some degree sustain the struggle against God. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The great dragon (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., the dragon, the great (dragon).<p>That old serpent (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., the serpent, the old (serpent).
