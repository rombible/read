The omission of the epithet in this passage, which describes the Word of God as the conqueror and the judge, is not without significance. The sword is now wielded for but one work—the word that Christ spoke will judge men at the last day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-48.htm" title="He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.">John 12:48</a>). The power of this word found an illustration in the falling back of the hostile band which came to take Him in the day of His humiliation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-5.htm" title="They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.">John 18:5</a>); yet more gloriously will the power of His word be felt (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-29.htm" title="Is not my word like as a fire? said the LORD; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?">Jeremiah 23:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a>) when He will slay the wicked with the word of His mouth. The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a> must be borne in mind. Christ comes as King; His is a rule in righteousness; those who oppose this kingdom of righteousness find the shepherd’s staff as a rod of iron; the stone rejected falls upon the builders, and grinds them to powder. It is thus that the winepress of God’s wrath is set up, and the righteous King appears as one who treads it out. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1-3</a>.) <span class= "ital">He</span> Himself (the emphasis lies here) treads it. We have again the figure of the vintage made use of.

He has many crowns, for he is King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is arrayed in a vesture dipped in his own blood, by which he purchased his power as Mediator; and in the blood of his enemies, over whom he always prevails. His name is The Word of God; a name none fully knows but himself; only this we know, that this Word was God manifest in the flesh; but his perfections cannot be fully understood by any creature. Angels and saints follow, and are like Christ in their armour of purity and righteousness. The threatenings of the written word he is going to execute on his enemies. The ensigns of his authority are his name; asserting his authority and power, warning the most powerful princes to submit, or they must fall before him. The powers of earth and hell make their utmost effort. These verses declare important events, foretold by the prophets. These persons were not excused because they did what their leaders bade them. How vain will be the plea of many sinners at the great day! We followed our guides; we did as we saw others do! God has given a rule to walk by, in his word; neither the example of the most, nor of the chief, must influence us contrary thereto: if we do as the most do, we must go where the most go, even into the burning lake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>.
