He has many crowns, for he is King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is arrayed in a vesture dipped in his own blood, by which he purchased his power as Mediator; and in the blood of his enemies, over whom he always prevails. His name is The Word of God; a name none fully knows but himself; only this we know, that this Word was God manifest in the flesh; but his perfections cannot be fully understood by any creature. Angels and saints follow, and are like Christ in their armour of purity and righteousness. The threatenings of the written word he is going to execute on his enemies. The ensigns of his authority are his name; asserting his authority and power, warning the most powerful princes to submit, or they must fall before him. The powers of earth and hell make their utmost effort. These verses declare important events, foretold by the prophets. These persons were not excused because they did what their leaders bade them. How vain will be the plea of many sinners at the great day! We followed our guides; we did as we saw others do! God has given a rule to walk by, in his word; neither the example of the most, nor of the chief, must influence us contrary thereto: if we do as the most do, we must go where the most go, even into the burning lake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the armies which were in heaven followed him - The heavenly hosts; particularly, it would seem, the redeemed, as there would be some incongruity in representing the angels as riding in this manner.

Not the angels, though they are God's host, and are the armies of the heavens; they are in heaven, and dwell there, and follow Christ, attend upon him, and minister to him, and have been sometimes represented by horses and horsemen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a> and they are pure and holy creatures, and will come with Christ to judgment: but this vision refers not to the day of judgment; and besides, the saints are meant, as appears by their habit, for the fine linen, white and clean, is the righteousness of the saints, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a> and the righteousness of angels and saints is not the same. Moreover, these are the same company described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>. The saints are in a state of warfare, have many enemies to fight with, sin, Satan, and the world; they are enlisted as volunteers under Christ, the Captain of salvation; they are provided with the whole armour of God, and are very numerous, and always more than conquerors through Christ: these are described by the place where they were, "in heaven"; not being glorified saints in heaven; with these indeed Christ will come to judgment, even with all his saints with him; but members of the church militant, said to be in heaven, because that is often called the kingdom of heaven; and because their names are written in heaven, and they are of heavenly extract; they are born from above, and are partakers of the heavenly calling; they belong to heaven, they are citizens of it, and are pressing on to it. And these <p>followed him; Christ, their Leader and Commander in the exercise of grace, and in the discharge of duty; having gone on in his ways through a train of sufferings, and cleaved unto him, and now attend him; not to assist in fighting, but to add to the glorious and triumphant appearance of their General; and therefore are said to be <p>upon white horses; they had served Christ in his Gospel, which some of them had preached, and all professed, and had maintained the purity of it in doctrine and practice, and now triumphed in Christ, and along with him, riding upon horses of the same colour with his, as being his princes and nobles, and whom he had made kings as well as priests; the former may be signified by their horses; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a> and the latter by their following habit, <p>clothed in fine linen, white and clean; not the horses, but the armies on them; which designs not their inward purity, which was very glorious; nor their outward conversation garments, washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb; but the robe of Christ's righteousness, which is pure and spotless: these have no armour on, for they are not to strike a blow, only their General, who has the bloody garment on, is to tread the winepress, and destroy antichrist with the breath of his mouth, or with his sword proceeding out of it, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> And the armies <i>which were</i> in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</span><p>(14) The company or retinue of Christ, holy, innumerable, heavenly, judicial, royal and pure.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">the armies</span> which were <span class="ital">in heaven</span>] According to ordinary O.

But some think that the glorified Saints are at least included: it seems in harmony with the ideas of this Book to represent them, not indeed as executing Christ’s vengeance (which the angels do, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-19.htm" title="And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.">Revelation 14:19</a>; St <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-39.htm" title="The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels....">Matthew 13:39-42</a>), but as spectators of His triumph, which is all that these armies seem to be.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fine linen, white and clean</span>] The dress of Angels in St <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm" title="His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:">Matthew 28:3</a> and parallels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm" title="And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;">Acts 1:10</a>; but of Saints in this Book, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm" title="You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.">Revelation 3:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a>, and probably <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a> : compare the almost exactly similar words of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm" title="And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.">Revelation 19:8</a></span>. Here this costume contrasts with the blood-dyed one of their Leader. The probable meaning is, that they have no need to take part in the work of slaughter, see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-21.htm" title="And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.">Revelation 19:21</a></span>.
