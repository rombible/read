The words “from henceforth” form a difficulty; the reason for their introduction is to be found in the state of trouble which the last verses describe: the righteous are happy in being taken away from the evil to come. Or may it be that the words are designed to console the mourners in an age when dark unbelief robs away the sweet resurrection trust, and writes over its graves, “Farewell for ever”? If the climax of world-power should be bitter scorn of the idea of a life to come, and complacent satisfaction with a portion in this world, then words of faith, proclaiming that the dead are happy and restful, and that their work is not in vain in the Lord, may find new force to sustain a fainting courage or a wavering trust.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/revelation/14.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Ecclesiastes<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">NAKED OR CLOTHED?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm" title="As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a></span>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is to be observed that these two sharply contrasted texts do not refer to the same persons. The former is spoken of a rich worldling, the latter of ‘the dead who die in the Lord.’ The unrelieved gloom of the one is as a dark background against which the triumphant assurance of the other shines out the more brightly, and deepens the gloom which heightens it. The end of the man who has to go away from earth naked and empty-handed acquires new tragic force when set against the lot of those ‘whose works do follow them.’ Well-worn and commonplace as both sets of thought may be, they may perhaps be flashed up into new vividness by juxtaposition; and if in this sermon we have nothing new to say, old truth is not out of place till it has been wrought into and influenced our daily practice. We shall best gather the lessons of our text if we consider what we must leave, what we must take, and what we may take.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. What we must leave.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Preacher in the context presses home a formidable array of the limitations and insufficiencies of wealth. Possessed, it cannot satisfy, for the appetite grows with indulgence. Its increase barely keeps pace with the increase of its consumers. It contributes nothing to the advantage of its so-called owner except ‘the beholding of it with his eyes,’ and the need of watching it keeps them open when he would fain sleep. It is often kept to the owner’s hurt, it often disappears in unfortunate speculation, and the possessor’s heirs are paupers. But, even if all these possibilities are safely weathered, the man has to die and leave it all behind. ‘He shall take nothing of his labour which he can carry away in his hand’; that is to say, death separates from all with whom the life of the body brings us into connection. The things which are no parts of our true selves are ours in a very modified sense even whilst we seem to possess them, and the term of possession has a definite close. ‘Shrouds have no pockets,’ as the stern old proverb says. How many men have lived in the houses which we call ours, sat on our seats, walked over our lands, carried in their purses the money that is in ours! Is ‘the game worth the candle’ when we give our labour for so imperfect and brief a possession as at the fullest and the longest we enjoy of all earthly good? Surely a wise man will set little store by possessions of all which a cold, irresistible hand will come to strip him. Surely the life is wasted which spends its energy in robing itself in garments which will all be stripped from it when the naked self ‘returns to go as he came.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But there are other things than these earthly possessions from which death separates us. It carries us far away from the sound of human voices and isolates us from living men. Honour and reputation cease to be audible. When a prominent man dies, what a clatter of conflicting judgments contends over his grave! and how utterly he is beyond them all! Praise or blame, blessing or banning are equally powerless to reach the unhearing ear or to agitate the unbeating heart. And when one of our small selves passes out of life, we hear no more the voice of censure or of praise, of love or of hate. Is it worth while to toil for the ‘hollow wraith of dying fame,’ or even for the clasp of loving hands which have to be loosened so surely and so soon?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then again, there are other things which must be left behind as belonging only to the present order, and connected with bodily life. There will be no scope for material work, and much of all our knowledge will be antiquated when the light beyond shines in. As we shall have occasion to see presently, there is a permanent element in the most material work, and if in handling the transient we have been living for the eternal, such work will abide; but if we think of the spirit in which a sad majority do their daily tasks, whether of a more material or of a more intellectual sort, we must recognise that a very large proportion of all the business of life must come to an end here. There is nothing in it that will stand the voyage across the great deep, or that can survive in the order of things to which we go. What is a man to do in another world, supposing there is another world, where ledgers and mills are out of date? Or what has a scholar or scientist to do in a state of things where there is no place for dictionaries and grammars, for acute criticism, or for a careful scientific research?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Physical science, linguistic knowledge, political wisdom, will be antiquated. The poetry which glorifies afresh and interprets the present will have lost its meaning. Half the problems that torture us here will cease to have existence, and most of the other half will have been solved by simple change of position. ‘Whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away’; and it becomes us all to bethink ourselves whether there is anything in our lives that we can carry away when all that is ‘of the earth earthy’ has sunk into nothingness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. What we must take.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>We must take <span class="ital">ourselves</span>. It is the same ‘he’ who goes ‘naked as he came’; it is the same ‘he’ who ‘came from his mother’s womb,’ and is ‘born again’ as it were into a new life, only ‘he’ has by his earthly life been developed and revealed. The plant has flowered and fruited. What was mere potentiality has become fact. There is now fixed character. The transient possessions, relationships, and occupations of the earthly life are gone, but the man that they have made is there. And in the character there are predominant habits which insist upon having their sway, and a memory of which, as we may believe, there is written indelibly all the past. Whatever death may strip from us, there is no reason to suppose that it touches the consciousness and personal identity, or the prevailing set and inclination of our characters. And if we do indeed pass into another life ‘not in entire forgetfulness, and not in utter nakedness,’ but carrying a perfected memory and clothed in a garment woven of all our past actions, there needs no more to bring about a solemn and continuous act of judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. What we may take.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘Their works do follow them.’ These are the words of the Spirit concerning ‘the dead who die in the Lord.’ We need not fear marring the great truth that ‘not by works of righteousness but by His mercy He saved us,’ if we firmly grasp the large assurance which this text blessedly contains. A Christian man’s works are perpetual in the measure in which they harmonise with the divine will, in the measure they have eternal consequences in himself whatever they may have on others. If we live opening our minds and hearts to the influx of the divine power ‘that worketh in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure,’ then we may be humbly sure that these ‘works’ are eternal; and though they will never constitute the ground of our acceptance, they will never fail to secure ‘a great recompence of reward.’ To many a humble saint there will be a moment of wondering thankfulness when he sees these his ‘children whom God hath given him’ clustered round him, and has to say, ‘Lord, when saw I Thee naked, or in prison, and visited Thee?’ There will be many an apocalypse of grateful surprise in the revelations of the heavens. We remember Milton’s noble explanation of these great words which may well silence our feeble attempts to enforce them-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘Thy works and alms and all thy good endeavour<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Stood not behind, nor in the grave were trod,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But as faith pointed with her golden rod,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Followed them up to joy and bliss for ever.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>So then, life here and yonder will for the Christian soul be one continuous whole, only that there, while ‘their works do follow them,’ ‘they rest from their labours.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">And I heard a voice from heaven </span>— This is most seasonably heard when the beast is in his highest power and fury; <span class="ital">saying unto me, Write — </span>He was at first commanded to write the whole book.

How different is this state from that of those (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-11.htm" title="And the smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.">Revelation 14:11</a>) <span class="ital">who have no rest day nor night! </span>Reader, which wilt thou choose? <span class="ital">And their works </span>— Each one’s peculiar works, done from a principle of faith and love, with a single eye to the glory of God, and in a spirit of humility before God, resignation to his will, and patience under all trials and sufferings; and in meekness, gentleness, and long-suffering toward those who oppose them in their Christian course of cheerfully doing good, and patiently suffering ill; <span class="ital">follow them </span>— And will be produced as evidences of their faith and love; or of the genuineness of their religion at the day of judgment. But the words, <span class="greekheb">τα εργα αυτων ακολουθει μετ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">αυτων</span>, properly signify, <span class="ital">their works follow with them, </span>or follow them immediately; that is, the fruit of their works; they reap this, in some measure, immediately on their admission into paradise. Observe, reader, their works do not <span class="ital">go before, </span>to procure for them admittance into the mansions of joy and glory, but they follow or attend them when admitted. Bishop Newton accounts for the expression, <span class="ital">From henceforth, blessed are the dead, </span>&c., by observing, that though from the time of the Reformation, “the blessedness of the dead who die in the Lord hath not been enlarged, yet it hath been much better understood, more clearly <span class="ital">written </span>and promulgated than it was before, and the contrary doctrine of purgatory hath been exploded and banished from the belief of all reasonable men. This truth,” adds he, “was moreover one of the leading principles of the Reformation. What first provoked Luther’s spirit was the scandalous sale of indulgences; and the doctrine of indulgences having a close connection with the doctrine of purgatory, the refutation of the one naturally leads to the refutation of the other; and his first work of reformation was his ninety-five theses, or positions, against indulgences, purgatory, and the dependent doctrines. So that he may be said literally to have fulfilled the command from heaven, of <span class="ital">writing, Blessed are the dead,</span> &c., and from that time to this, this truth hath been so clearly asserted, and so solemnly established, that it is likely to prevail for ever.” But though what the bishop here states might be one reason of the expression, <span class="ital">from henceforth blessed, </span>&c., yet the principal reason of its being used seems evidently to have been that above suggested, namely, to intimate that the sufferings which the people of God would be exposed to at this period, from the persecutions of the antichristian power, would be so great that those individuals who escaped them by being taken out of the world by death before they came, would have reason to think themselves happy.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:6-13 The progress of the Reformation appears to be here set forth. The four proclamations are plain in their meaning; that all Christians may be encouraged, in the time of trial, to be faithful to their Lord. The gospel is the great means whereby men are brought to fear God, and to give glory to him. The preaching of the everlasting gospel shakes the foundations of antichrist in the world, and hastens its downfal. If any persist in being subject to the beast, and in promoting his cause, they must expect to be for ever miserable in soul and body. The believer is to venture or suffer any thing in obeying the commandments of God, and professing the faith of Jesus. May God bestow this patience upon us. Observe the description of those that are and shall be blessed: such as die in the Lord; die in the cause of Christ, in a state of union with Christ; such as are found in Christ when death comes. They rest from all sin, temptation, sorrow, and persecution; for there the wicked cease from troubling, there the weary are at rest. Their works follow them: do not go before as their title, or purchase, but follow them as proofs of their having lived and died in the Lord: the remembrance of them will be pleasant, and the reward far above all their services and sufferings. This is made sure by the testimony of the Spirit, witnessing with their spirits, and the written word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I heard a voice from heaven - A voice that seemed to speak from heaven.<p>Saying unto me, Write - Make a record of this truth. We may suppose that John was engaged in making a record of what he saw in vision; he was now instructed to make a record of what he heard. This passage may be referred to as a proof that he wrote this book while in Patmos, or as the heavenly disclosures were made to him, and not afterward from memory.<p>Blessed are the dead - That is, the condition of those who die in the manner which is immediately specified, is to be regarded as a blessed or happy one. It is much to be able to say of the dead that they are "blessed." There is much in death that is sad; we so much dread it by nature; it cuts us off from so much that is dear to us; it blasts so many hopes; and the grave is so cold and cheerless a resting place, that we owe much to a system of religion which will enable us to say and to feel, that it is a blessed thing to die. Assuredly we should be grateful for any system of religion which will enable us thus to speak of those who are dead; which will enable us, with corresponding feeling, to look forward to our own departure from this world.<p>Which die in the Lord - Not all the dead; for God never pronounces the condition of the wicked who die, blessed or happy. Religion guards this point, and confines the declaration to those who furnish evidence that they are prepared for heaven. The phrase "to die in the Lord" implies the following things:<p>(1) That they who thus die are the friends of the Lord Jesus. The language "to be in the Lord" is often used to denote true attachment to him, or close union with him. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-13.htm">Romans 16:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-14.htm">Philippians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>. The assurance, then, is limited to those who are sincere Christians; for this the language properly implies, and we are authorized to apply it only as there is evidence of true religion.<p>(2) to "die in the Lord" would seem also to imply that there should be, at the time, the evidence of his favor and friendship. This would apply:<p>(a) to those who die as martyrs, giving their lives as a testimony to the truth of religion, and as an evidence of their love for it; and,<p>(b) to those who have the comforting evidence of his presence and favor on the bed of death.<p>From henceforth - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  aparti. This word has given no little perplexity to expositors, and it has been variously rendered. Some have connected it with the word "blessed" - "Blessed henceforth are the dead who die in the Lord"; that is, they will be ever-onward blessed: some with the word "die," referring to the time when the apostle was writing - "Blessed are they who, after this time, die in the Lord"; designing to comfort those who were exposed to death, and who would die as martyrs: some as referring to the times contemplated in these visions - "Blessed will they be who shall die in those future times." Witsius understands this as meaning that, from the time of their death, they would be blessed, as if it had been said, immediately after their dissolution they would be blessed. Doddridge renders it, "Henceforth blessed are the dead." The language is evidently not to be construed as implying that they who had died in the faith before were not happy, but that in the times of trial and persecution that were to come, they were to be regarded as especially blessed who should escape from these sorrows by a Christian death. Scenes of woe were indeed to occur, in which many believers would die. But their condition was not to be regarded as one of misfortune, but of blessedness and joy, for:<p>(a) they would die in an honorable cause;<p>(b) they would emerge from a world of sorrow; and,<p>(c) they would rise to eternal life and peace.<p>The design, therefore, of the verse is to impart consolation and support to those who would be exposed to a martyr's death, and to those who, in times of persecution, would see their friends exposed to such a death. It may be added that the declaration here made is true still, and ever will be. It is a blessed thing to die in the Lord.<p>Yea, saith the Spirit - The Holy Spirit; "the Spirit by whose inspiration and command I record this" (Doddridge).<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

Their full blessedness is now "from henceforth," that is, FROM THIS TIME, when the judgment on the beast and the harvest gatherings of the elect are imminent. The time so earnestly longed for by former martyrs is now all but come; the full number of their fellow servants is on the verge of completion; they have no longer to "rest (the same Greek as here, anapausis) yet for a little season," their eternal rest, or cessation from toils (2Th 1:7; Greek, "anesis," relaxation after hardships. Heb 4:9, 10, sabbatism of rest; and Greek, "catapausis," akin to the Greek here) is close at hand now. They are blessed in being about to sit down to the marriage supper of the Lamb (Re 19:9), and in having part in the first resurrection (Re 20:6), and in having right to the tree of life (Re 22:14). In Re 14:14-16 follows the explanation of why they are pronounced "blessed" now in particular, namely, the Son of man on the cloud is just coming to gather them in as the harvest ripe for garner.<p>Yea, saith the Spirit&#8212;The words of God the Father (the "voice from heaven") are echoed back and confirmed by the Spirit (speaking in the Word, Re 2:7; 22:17; and in the saints, 2Co 5:5; 1Pe 4:14).

But A, C, Vulgate, and Syriac read "for." They rest from their toils because their time for toil is past; they enter on the blessed rest because of their faith evinced by their works which, therefore, "follow WITH (so the Greek) them." Their works are specified because respect is had to the coming judgment, wherein every man shall be "judged according to his works." His works do not go before the believer, nor even go by his side, but follow him at the same time that they go with him as a proof that he is Christ's.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write:</span> these words denote the excellency of the following saying; it is <span class="ital">a voice from heaven, </span> therefore worthy of our attention.

The emphasis of the particle seems to be, to obviate the doubts of those who should happen to die under antichrist’s rage, because they died not by the hands of pagans and avowed enemies of the gospel, but of such as should call themselves Christians; such, saith God, die for the Lord, and are blessed, and shall be blessed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yea, saith the Spirit; </span> the Spirit of truth affirms it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That they may rest from their labours; </span> they shall be at rest from the troubles of this life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And their works do follow them; </span> and their good deeds and patient sufferings shall follow them, as witnesses for them before the Judge of the quick and the dead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here follow two visions, the one of a harvest, the other of a vintage; there is no great difficulty in determining, that they both signify some judicial dispensations of God, that he would bring upon the world, or some part of it, the latter of which should be greater than the former: yet Dr. More and Mr. Mede have another notion of them.

Cutting down of corn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2.) Gathering it into the barn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3.) Threshing it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whence, in Scripture, it signifieth either cutting and destroying, or safety and preserving, which is the end of gathering corn into the barn. We have examples of the former, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-3.htm" title="The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, said the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 17:3</a>,5 Jer 51:33</span>; but of the latter we have only examples in the New Testament, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-2.htm" title="Therefore said he to them, The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few: pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.">Luke 10:2</a></span>.

Like that which was heard at Christ's baptism and transfiguration, certifying the truth of what follows, so that that may be depended upon as an undoubted verity: <p>saying unto me, write; which is a further confirmation of the following sayings being true and faithful; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a><p>blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; merely to die is not an happiness, for death is common to all, good and bad; it is a disunion of soul and body, and cannot be in itself desirable; it is the fruit of sin, and has something in it awful and terrible; and though it is the privilege of believers, as its sting is removed by Christ, yet not as simply and absolutely considered; but to die in the Lord is a blessedness: some render the words, "which die for the Lord"; so the Arabic version, "which die for the faith of the Lord"; and the Ethiopic version, "which die for God"; and so restrain them to the martyrs of Jesus: to suffer death for the sake of Christ and his Gospel is a gift and an honour, and what glorifies Christ; and there is a glory consequent upon it, which such shall enjoy; but then in the spiritual reign of Christ, to which this passage refers, and after the destruction of antichrist, there will be no more suffering for Christ, no more martyrdoms; wherefore this cannot be the sense of the words: nor do they mean dying in the lively exercise of faith and hope in the Lord; for though it is a happiness so to die, both to persons themselves, and to their friends and relations, yet these are not the only persons that are blessed; there are some who all their lifetime are subject to bondage, and go off in the dark, and yet are happy; but to die in the Lord is to die interested in him, in union to him; which union is not dissolved by death, and which preserves from all condemnation, at death or at judgment, and secures the soul's immediate entrance into happiness, and the resurrection of the body at the last day, and therefore such must be blessed: the phrase, "from henceforth", is differently placed; the Ethiopic version connects it with the word "write", rendering it, "write now"; and the Vulgate Latin version reads it with the next clause, "hereafter, yea, saith the Spirit"; and so the Latin interpreter of the Syriac version, though that itself seems rather to place it as ours does, and which is most correct; and is to be understood not of the time of John's writing, thenceforward to the resurrection; for those that died before his time were as happy as those who died after; nor of the time of death, though it is a truth, that from the time of the saints' death, and from the very moment of their separation, they are blessed, and are in a state of happiness until the resurrection; but of that period of time which the declarations made by the three preceding angels refer to, from thenceforward, and after the destruction of antichrist, and during the spiritual reign of Christ: and the sense is, that happy will those persons be that die in Christ within that time, and before the Laodicean church state takes place; when coldness, lukewarmness, and carnal security will seize upon men, and Christ will come upon them at an unawares; and those sharp and severe times will commence, signified by the harvest and vintage of the earth in the following verses, and which seem to be no other than the end of the world, and the destruction of it; wherefore happy will they be that are going to heaven before that time comes; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a><p>yea, saith the Spirit; the third witness in heaven, who sets his seal to the truth of what the voice declares, and shows wherein this blessedness will consist: <p>that they may rest from their labours; both of body and soul; from all toil of body, and laborious work, from all diseases and distempers of body, and all outward sorrows and calamities men labour under, and are fatigued with in this life; and from all inward troubles, from a body of sin, from the temptations of Satan, and from all doubts and fears, from their present warfare state, and all conflicts with their spiritual enemies: <p>and their works do follow them; they do not go before them, to prepare heaven and happiness for them; nor do they take them along with them, and use them as pleas for their admission into the heavenly glory; but they will follow them, and will be found to praise, and honour, and glory, and will be taken notice of by Christ, and graciously rewarded by him, at his appearing and kingdom. This is directly opposite to the notions of the Jews, who say, that when a man departs this life, his works "go before him", and say unto him, thou hast done so and so, in such a place, and on such a day (w); and that whoever does a good work in this world, it shall "go before him" in the world to come (x); and so they (y) represent good works as saying to a man when he is about to die, <p>"go in peace; before thou gettest thither,  , we will go before thee, as it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a> "thy righteousness shall go before thee".'' <p>Sometimes they say (z), they go along with him at the time of a man's departure: neither gold, nor silver, nor precious stones and pearls accompany him, but the law and good works, as it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a> "when thou goest it shall lead thee", &amp;c. <p>(w) T.

A heavenly voice,[3511] concerning which it is in no way said to what person it belongs,[3512] commands John to write down what was itself just proclaimed as a word of revelation of his spirit (viz., <span class="greekheb">Μακάρ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μετʼ αὐτῶν</span>), because[3513] this word of revelation contains the most effectual consolation for believers who are oppressed by the secular power, and even threatened with death.[3514] Züll. is wrong in considering that there are two voices, for the voice of the Spirit (<span class="greekheb">ναὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πν</span>., <span class="greekheb">ἳνα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.) is distinguished here as little from the “voice from heaven,” as in the epistles, chs. 2 and 3, what the Spirit says is to be distinguished from what the Lord commands to be written. The voice from heaven belongs to a heavenly person, who, as interpreter of the Spirit, communicates his revelation to the prophet in intelligible words. The first sentence, which concludes with <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span>, contains what is properly the main point of the consolatory declaration, and, as it were, the theme, whose meaning (<span class="greekheb">μακάριοι</span>) is more fully explained in the following sentence. Not only by the formal plan, but also in a still more inward way, is this latter part of the heavenly discourse to be distinguished from the former; the <span class="greekheb">ναὶ</span> already shows us the beginning of a new declaration, and a new declaration is also actually presented, since—as the parenthetical words <span class="greekheb">λέγει τὸ πνεῦμα</span> affirm—this confirmation and exposition (<span class="greekheb">ναὶ</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἴνα ἀναπαήσονται</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), added to the first words <span class="greekheb">Μακάριοι</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span>, appear in a definite way as a revelation of the Spirit. It is, therefore, incorrect to refer the <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span> to the latter sentence, whether in the sense of Vitr., who combines the <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἀναπαήσ</span>., or in that of Lamb., Bos., who[3515] writes <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρτί</span> (i.e., <span class="greekheb">ἀπηρτισμένως</span>), and tries to explain the wonderfully composed formula of assurance <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρτὶ ναὶ</span> by the absolute <span class="ital">plane profecto</span>.[3516] The reference of the <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span>[3517] to the emphatically prefixed conception of <span class="greekheb">μακάριοι</span> is shown by the relation of the thought.[3518] By a combination with <span class="greekheb">ἀποθνήσκ</span>., Züll. reaches the incorrect interpretation: “Better on this account than those who experience the impending time of distress, are the martyrs dying just at the beginning of this time;”[3519] but the conception <span class="greekheb">μακάριοι</span> means much more and differently from what Züll. expresses, and to refer it alone to martyrs is as certainly incorrect as <span class="greekheb">ἀποθνήσκειν ἐν κυρίῳ</span> is not “to die for the sake of the Lord.”[3520]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The dead “who die[3521] <span class="ital">in the Lord</span>,” i.e., bound with him by faith, and kept in fellowship with him[3522] by fidelity to the faith even unto death,[3523] are “blessed from henceforth,” because, viz., now the glorious end, which will bring condemnation to enemies[3524] and complete blessedness to all believers,[3525] immediately impends. This is the eschatological reference of the <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span>[3526] presented in the connection, in its combination with the idea <span class="greekheb">μακάριοι</span>, which in itself points already to the goal of the Christian hope.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Incorrect is the explanation of Stern, who, in uncertainty, refers the <span class="greekheb">απʼ ἄρτι</span> to the entire sentence <span class="greekheb">μακάρ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀποθν</span>., and incorrectly tries to apply what is said only of the end of time in such sense that then they who die in Christ immediately enter paradise—with intermission of purgatory, which is, therefore, indirectly fixed for the dying prior to that final time; while just as incorrectly, in order to escape the doctrine of purgatory, Calov., etc., explain the <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span> by “from the death of every one.” [See Note LXXVII., p. 405.] <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀναπαήσονται ἐκ τῶν κόπων αὐτῶν</span>. The future is formed from <span class="greekheb">ἀναπαύω</span>, just as <span class="greekheb">κατακαήσομαι</span> from <span class="greekheb">κατακαίω</span>.[3527] The <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> here can depend as little upon the parenthetical <span class="greekheb">λέγει τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πν</span>.[3528] as the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="Therefore, as you abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:7</a> upon the succeeding <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span>.

Like Paul (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>), though on different grounds, the writer is controverting a fear (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 4 Esd. 13:24) that at the advent of messiah those who survived on earth would have some advantage over those who had already died. “Yea, saith the Spirit”—ratifying what has been said—“happy to rest from their labours” (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, their Christian activities, not the special form of their death for the faith). So far as the sense is concerned, it matters little whether <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. depends on <span class="greekheb">μακάριοι</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἀποθνήσκοντες</span>. Both constructions are grammatically legitimate, though the former is perhaps closer. The point of the passage (note <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">γράψον</span>, as in 1–3., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a> f.) is that the bliss of death for a Christian consists not in mere rest from labour but in a rest which brings the reward of labour. While death brings the rest, the reward cannot be given till the final judgment. Consequently the near prospect of the latter is welcome, among other reasons, because it means the long-deferred recompense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>) for the faithful dead. So far from being forgotten (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm" title="I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you can not bear them which are evil: and you have tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars:">Revelation 2:2</a> f., 19, 23, etc.), their <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span> accompany them to judgment and—it is implied—receive their proper reward there (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Milton’s fourteenth sonnet). The bliss of the departed therefore depends upon two grounds: their <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span> are not to be overlooked, and the interval of waiting is now (<span class="greekheb">ἀπάρτι</span>) brief. The fourth degree of bliss in 4 Ezra 7 :[95] is that the departed spirits of the just understand “the rest which, gathered in their chambers [<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:...">Revelation 6:9-11</a>] they can enjoy now with deep quietness, guarded by angels, as well as the glory which still awaits them in the latter days”. John does not share the current pessimistic belief (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="ital">Apoc. Bar.</span> xi.–xii. 4, Verg. <span class="ital">Aen.</span> i. 94, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm" title="The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.">Isaiah 57:1</a> f.) that death was preferable to life, in view of the overwhelming miseries of the age. His thought is not that death is happier than life under the circumstances, but that if death came in the line of religious duty it involved no deprivation. The language reflects <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2</a> (with <span class="greekheb">κόπων</span> put for <span class="greekheb">ἔργων</span>), but while it is true enough, it is hardly apposite, to think of the dead as resting from works (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a>), no more being needed. The root of the passage lies not in the Iranian belief (Brandt, 423 f., Böklen, 41) that the soul was escorted by its good deeds to bliss in another world (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Maas, <span class="ital">Orpheus</span>, 217 f.), but in the closer soil of Jewish hope (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Bacher’s <span class="ital">Agada d. Tannaiten</span>,2 i. 399 f.; Volz 103) as in En. ciii. 2, 3, Apoc. Bar. xiv. 12, 13, and Pirke Aboth vi. 9 (hora discessus hominis non comitantur eum argentum aut aurum aut lapides pretiosi aut margaritae, sed lex et opera bona). In 4 Esd. 7:35 (where, at the resurrection of the dead, “the work shall follow and the reward be disclosed”) <span class="ital">opus</span> may be a Hebraism for “recompense” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-20.htm" title="Let this be the reward of my adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.">Psalm 109:20</a> <span class="greekheb">ἔργον</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-25.htm" title="Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.">1 Timothy 5:25</a>). Contemporary Jewish eschatology also took a despairing view of the world (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 4 Esd. 4:26–33). But while the dead are pronounced “blessed,” <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in Apoc. Bar. xi. 7, it is because they have not lived to see the ruins of Jerusalem and the downfall of Israel. Better death than that experience! Death is a blessing compared with the life which falls upon times so out of joint (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-6.htm" title="And swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:">Revelation 10:6</a> f.). The living may well envy the dead. In John’s Apocalypse, on the other hand, the dead are felicitated because they miss nothing by their martyrdom. Yet life is a boon. No plaintive, weary cry of <span class="ital">Weltschmerz</span> rises from the pages of this Apocalypse.—<span class="greekheb">ἀναπαύω</span> in the papyri means relief from public duties or the “resting” of land in agriculture (<span class="ital">cf.</span> U. Wilcken’s <span class="ital">Archiv f. Papyrusforschung</span>, i. pp. 157 f.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Blessing on the Faithful Dead, and the Harvest and the Vintage of the Earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them....">Revelation 14:13-20</a><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Write</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-4.htm" title="And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.">Revelation 10:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Blessed are the dead</span> &c.] Two questions arise as to this verse, though its touching associations make us unwilling to raise questions about it. What is its relevance <span class="ital">here?</span> and why are the holy dead blessed “<span class="ital">from henceforth</span>”?—i.e. probably, from the time foreshadowed by the last part of the vision. The answer to both probably is, that in those days a holy death will be the only escape from persecution and temptation, which “if it were possible should seduce even the Elect.” Not only “for the Elect’s sake the days shall be shortened,” but even before they end, one and another of the Elect will be delivered from them. Even now it is a matter of thanksgiving when a Christian is delivered by death “from the miseries of this wretched world, from the body of death, and from all temptation,” and much more then, when temptation is so much sorer that no Saint can dare wish to abide in the flesh.—This seems better than supposing that the special blessedness of the dead of those days consists only in the interval being shorter before their “perfect consummation and bliss.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that they may rest</span>] The construction probably is, “who die that they may rest”—the sense is, “Yea, they are indeed blessed, for the result, and the providential end, of their dying is, to bring them to rest.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and their works</span>] Read, <span class="bld">for their works</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">do follow them</span>] More accurately, <span class="bld">follow with them</span>: there is therefore hardly any resemblance to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-24.htm" title="Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after....">1 Timothy 5:24-25</a>.

The Spirit Himself, as it were by a parenthesis, interrupts that voice, and at once approves and amplifies it, by the word <span class="greekheb">ἀπάρτι</span>, <span class="ital">from now;</span> just as after the words, <span class="ital">Write, Blessed</span>, there follows, in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

We have just had mentioned the necessity for patience on the part of the saints; here we have an encouragement and incentive to that patience, inasmuch as they who die in the Lord are henceforward blessed. In what their blessedness consists, the next sentence slates. The full consummation of their bliss may not occur until after the judgment, but the faithful have not to wait until then for peace; their conflict is, after all, only for this life, and thus they may well be content to suffer for so short a period (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them;</span> <span class="accented">that they shall rest</span>...  <span class="accented">for their works</span>, etc. The first part explains the "blessedness" of the previous passage; in this <span class="accented">rest</span> consists their blessedness. The last clause, "for their works," etc., explains why the blessedness consists in rest; they have henceforth no need of labours, for the effects of their former works accompany them and permit them now complete rest. Contrast the opposite fate of the wicked, described in ver. 11. St. Paul urges upon Christians the same duty, and proffers the same encouragement: "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Blessed (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>.<p>From henceforth (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;' &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>. To be joined as in A.V. and Rev., with die in the preceding clause, and not with blessed, nor with the following clause. Not from henceforth saith the Spirit. The meaning is variously explained. Some, from the beginning of the Christian age and onward to the end; others, from the moment of death, connecting henceforth with blessed; others from the time when the harvest of the earth is about to be reaped. Sophocles says: "Show all religious reverence to the gods, for all other things Father Zeus counts secondary; for the reward of piety follows men in death.
