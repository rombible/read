It has been asked, “What harvest is this?” It is the gathering of the good seed, the full corn in the ear, into the celestial garner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/4-26.htm" title="And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;">Mark 4:26-29</a>). The angel who announces that the harvest is ready comes forth from the Temple, the inner shrine, the holy place which was measured off in the sanctuary of the faithful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.">Revelation 11:1</a>); whereas the angel who calls for the vintage comes forth from the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18</a>).<p>The angel cries—<span class= "ital">Put forth</span> (or, <span class= "ital">send</span>)<span class= "ital"> thy sickle and reap, because the hour is come to reap, because the harvest of the earth is ripe</span> (or, <span class= "ital">dried</span>); the wheat stalks are dry, and the fields white for harvest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>). The sickle was put in: the earth was reaped.<p><span class= "bld">THE VINTAGE.</span><p>There must be some difference between the vintage and the harvest. There is an autumn gladness about the harvest: there are tokens of judgment in the vintage. It is not the sharp sickle alone which is required: the winepress, the winepress of God’s wrath, is called into use. An angel from the Temple calls to the Son of man to reap the harvest: an angel from the altar calls to an angel from the Temple to gather in the vintage. The vintage symbolises a harvest of judgment; do not the words respecting Babylon (the wine of the wrath of her fornication, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a>) come to the mind and confirm this? The angel rises from the altar, beneath which the murdered saints had cried, “How long?” and proclaims, “The vintage, the hour of vengeance, has come!” And it is not without significance that the angel to whom this cry is addressed comes forth out of the Temple, the safe sanctuary of God’s faithful ones, as one who has witnessed their secret sorrows and their sufferings, and is fitted “to recompense tribulation to the troublers of Israel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;">2Thessalonians 1:6</a>).<p>(17) <span class= "bld">And another angel . . .</span>—Translate, <span class= "ital">And another angel, . . . having himself also</span> (as well as the Son of man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14</a>) <span class= "ital">a sharp sickle.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:14-20 Warnings and judgments not having produced reformation, the sins of the nations are filled up, and they become ripe for judgments, represented by a harvest, an emblem which is used to signify the gathering of the righteous, when ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. The harvest time is when the corn is ripe; when the believers are ripe for heaven, then the wheat of the earth shall be gathered into Christ's garner. And by a vintage. The enemies of Christ and his church are not destroyed, till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will spare them no longer. The wine-press is the wrath of God, some terrible calamity, probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. The patience of God towards sinners, is the greatest miracle in the world; but, though lasting, it will not be everlasting; and ripeness in sin is a sure proof of judgment at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And another angel - The fourth in order, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8-9</a>.<p>Came out of the temple - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>.

That is, the command was borne directly from God by the angel to the Messiah, to go forth and reap the great harvest of the world. It is not a command of the angel, but a command from God the Father to the Son. This is in accordance with all the representations in the New Testament, that the Son, as Messiah or Redeemer, is subordinate to the Father, and performs the work which has been given him to do.

The time alluded to here is the end of the world, when the affairs of earth shall be about to he wound up. The design is to state that the Redeemer will then gather in a great and glorious harvest, and by this assurance to sustain the hearts of his people in times of trial and persecution. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Not the Holy Spirit, who, being God omniscient, knows the day and hour of judgment, which is a secret to men and angels, as Napier thinks; since though he dwells in the church as his temple, yet is never called an angel; nor does this angel represent the souls under the altar, who come out from thence, and importunately desire vengeance on the inhabitants of the earth, the worshippers of the beast, who had shed their blood; but rather the mighty angels who shall descend from heaven with Christ, and who shall be employed by him as reapers, to gather in his elect from the four winds, as well as to bind up the tares in bundles, and burn them; unless a set of Gospel ministers, as before, should be intended, who either by divine revelation, or by the signs of the time being come, and observed by them, will know that the harvest, or end of the world, is come; since this angel is said to come out of the temple, the church, which had been measured, and was now opened in heaven, and from whence angels are said to come, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a><p>crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud: as the first and third angels did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a> denoting great vehemence and importunity: thrust in thy sickle, and reap: which being spoken by an inferior angel, whether this designs the ministering spirits, or preachers of the word, must be understood not as commanding, nor even directing what should be done, but as beseeching and entreating: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-8.htm">Psalm 132:8</a>. Dr. Lightfoot thinks, and not without reason, that there is here some allusion to the putting in of the sickle, and reaping the first corn in Judea, at the feast of the passover, by the order of the sanhedrim, which sat in the temple; nor did any reap till they had the word given them, "reap", by the messengers of the court, called  , "the angels", or messengers "of the sanhedrim": to whom the reaper said, shall I reap? and they say to him, (a), "reap": the reasons follow: <p>for the time is come for thee to reap; the time of the end of the world, and of the judgment of it, which is fixed by God; and of Christ's coming to judge both quick and dead, and of the first resurrection, or the resurrection of the saints: <p>for the harvest of the earth is ripe: the measure of the sins of wicked men will now be filled up, and the afflictions of the saints will be accomplished in them, and the number of God's elect will be completed in the effectual calling; they will be all called, and so things will be ripe for the second coming of Christ. There seems to be some reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a> "put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe": the Jewish doctors ask (b), to whom is this said? R.

The subordinate and colourless character of the messiah is certainly puzzling, and tells against the Christian authorship of the passage. Messiah is summoned to his task by an angel, and even his task is followed up by another angel’s more decisive interference. He seems an angelic figure (<span class="ital">cf.</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm" title="And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the middle of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God;">Revelation 19:17</a>), perhaps <span class="ital">primus interpares</span> among the angels (so En. xlvi. 1: “and I saw another being [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Son of Man] whose countenance had the appearance of a man, and his face was full of graciousness, like one of the holy angels”). The conception was inconsistent with John’s high Christology, but he may have retained it, like so much else, for its poetic effect, or as part of a time-honoured apocalyptic tradition. That the messiah should receive divine instructions through one of his comrades (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm" title="You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Hebrews 1:9</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/2-3.htm" title="And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,...">Zechariah 2:3-4</a>) was perhaps not stranger than that he should require an angel in order to communicate with men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>). <span class="greekheb">πέμψον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.
