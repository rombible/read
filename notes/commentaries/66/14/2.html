Christ is with his church, and in the midst of her in all her troubles, therefore she is not consumed. His presence secures perseverance. His people appear honourably. They have the name of God written in their foreheads; they make a bold and open profession of their faith in God and Christ, and this is followed by suitable actings. There were persons in the darkest times, who ventured and laid down their lives for the worship and truth of the gospel of Christ. They kept themselves clean from the wicked abominations of the followers of antichrist. Their hearts were right with God; and they were freely pardoned in Christ; he is glorified in them, and they in him. May it be our prayer, our endeavour, our ambition, to be found in this honourable company. Those who are really sanctified and justified are meant here, for no hypocrite, however plausible, can be accounted to be without fault before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I heard a voice from heaven - Showing that the scene is laid in heaven, but that John in the vision was on the earth.<p>As the voice of many waters - As the sound of the ocean, or of a mighty cataract. That is, it was so loud that it could be heard from heaven to earth. No comparison could express this more sublimely than to say that it was like the roar of the ocean.<p>As the voice of a great thunder - As the loud sound of thunder.<p>And I heard the voice of harpers - In heaven: the song of redemption accompanied with strains of sweet instrumental music. For a description of the harp, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>.<p>Harping with their harps - Playing on their harps. This image gives new beauty to the description. Though the sound was loud and swelling, so loud that it could be heard on the earth, yet it was not mere shouting, or merely a tumultuous cry. "It was like the sweetness of symphonious harps." The music of heaven, though elevated and joyous, is sweet and harmonious; and perhaps one of the best representations of heaven on earth, is the effect produced on the soul by strains of sweet and solemn music. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. from&#8212;Greek, "out of."<p>voice of many waters&#8212;as is the voice of Himself, such also is the voice of His people.<p>I heard the voice of harpers&#8212;A, B, C, and Origen read, "the voice which I heard (was) as of harpers."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; </span> a loud voice, and terrible also to the followers of antichrist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The voice of harpers harping with their harps; </span> a musical, melodious voice, as of persons rejoicing.

Others have thought that the different properties and efficacy of the Gospel are designed; as its rapidity and irresistible force, by the many waters; its striking and shaking the consciences of men, by the thunder, Christ's ministers being sometimes "Boanergeses", sons of thunder; and its harmonious music, pleasant sound, peace, joy, and comfort it brings, by the voice of harpers. The Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, read, "the voice which I heard was as harpers", &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> stood on the mount Sion, and with him <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> an hundred forty <i>and</i> four thousand, having his Father's <span class="cverse3">{3}</span> name written in their foreheads.</span><p>(1) The history of the Church of Christ being finished for more than a 1300 years at which time Boniface the eighth lived as has been said: there remains the rest of the history of the conflicting or militant church, from there to the time of the last victory in three chapters. For first of all, as the foundation of the whole history, is described the standing of the Lamb with his army and retinue in five verses, after his worthy acts which he has done and yet does in most mighty manner, while he overthrows Antichrist with the spirit of his mouth, in the rest of this chapter and in the two following. To the description of the Lamb, are propounded three things: his situation, place and attendance: for the rest are expounded in the former visions, especially in the fifth chapter.<p>(2) Prepared to do his office see Ac 7:56, in the midst of the church, which mount Zion pictured before.<p>(3) This retinue of the Lamb is described first by divine mark<p>(as before in) Re 7:2 in this verse. Then by divine occupation, in that every one in his retinue most earnestly and sweetly Re 14:2 glorify the Lamb with a special song before God and his elect angels. Flesh and blood cannot hear this song, nor understand, Re 14:3. Lastly by their deeds done before, and their sanctification in that they were virgins, pure from spiritual and bodily fornication, that is, from impiety and unrighteousness. They followed the Lamb as a guide to all goodness, cleaved to him and are holy to him, as by grace redeemed by him. In truth and simplicity of Christ they have exercised all these things, sanctimony of life, the guidance of the Lamb, a thankful remembrance of redemption by him and finally (to conclude in a word) they are blameless before the Lord, Re 14:4,5.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:...">Revelation 14:2-3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span>.

In this passage, also, the relation of the <span class="greekheb">καινήν</span>, as to how this song is to be called because of its contents, is to be understood from the connection. The general reference to the work of redemption is not sufficient;[3440] but the subject has reference to that which is displayed to the gazing prophet, through the vision presented to him, and therefore to the faithfulness of God and the Lamb, whereby believers, upon the ground of the redemption accomplished by Christ, are preserved amid all the enticements or persecutions, on the part of the antichristian secular power, and brought to victory and eternal glory.[3441]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιον τοῦ θρόνου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. There the song, according to its most inner relation, belongs, because it describes the blessed goal of God’s ways, whose attainment was of itself pledged by the significant glory of the heavenly scene, ch. 4, upon which the entire arrangement of God’s ways rests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο μαθεῖν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ᾀδ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The one hundred and forty-four thousand, however, could learn this new song, i.e., not merely understand,[3442] but also appropriate it so as to afterwards sing it,[3443] because they alone have the experience of that which is celebrated in the song.[3444]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ἠγορασμένοι ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς</span>.
