Two remarkable periods of the most conspicuous of these judgments (the several steps of the whole of which are afterward described under seven vials) are here arranged under the two grand divisions figuratively styled the <span class="ital">harvest </span>and the <span class="ital">vintage. </span>In the days of Bishop Newton the third wo-trumpet had not begun to sound. Hence his lordship justly observed, ‘What particular events are signified by this <span class="ital">harvest </span>and <span class="ital">vintage, </span>it appears impossible for any man to determine; time alone can with certainty discover, for these things are yet in futurity. Only it may be observed, that these two signal judgments will as certainly come, as <span class="ital">harvest </span>and <span class="ital">vintage </span>succeed in their season; and in the course of providence the one will precede the other, as in the course of nature the <span class="ital">harvest </span>is before the <span class="ital">vintage; </span>and the latter will greatly surpass the former, and be attended with a most terrible destruction of God’s enemies.’ But although both these signal judgments were future when Bishop Newton wrote, it has been our lot to hear the voice of the third wo, and to behold in the French revolution the dreadful scenes of <span class="ital">the harvest. </span>Still, however, a more dreadful prospect extends before us. The days of <span class="ital">the vintage </span>are yet future; for the time hath not yet arrived when the great controversy of God with the nations shall be carried on <span class="ital">between the two seas, </span>in the neighbourhood of <span class="ital">the glorious holy mountain, </span>in the blood-stained vale of <span class="ital">Megiddo, </span>in the land whose space extends one thousand six hundred furlongs.” Mr. Faber, therefore, considers the <span class="ital">harvest </span>and the <span class="ital">vintage </span>here as predicting “two tremendous manifestations of God’s wrath, two seasons of peculiar misery;” and that the apostle gives here only a general intimation of these, reserving a more particular account of them for future consideration under the pouring out of the seven vials, which are all comprehended under the <span class="ital">third wo, </span>and which he divides into three classes; the vials of the harvest, the intermediate vials, and the vials of the vintage. — <span class="ital">Dissertation on the Prophecies, </span>vol. 2. pages 378 and 382, edition 1810. Whether and how far these views of Mr. Faber appear to be just and consistent with the general tenor of this latter part of the prophecy, we shall be better able to judge when we come to consider the contents of the two next chapters.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:14-20 Warnings and judgments not having produced reformation, the sins of the nations are filled up, and they become ripe for judgments, represented by a harvest, an emblem which is used to signify the gathering of the righteous, when ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. The harvest time is when the corn is ripe; when the believers are ripe for heaven, then the wheat of the earth shall be gathered into Christ's garner. And by a vintage. The enemies of Christ and his church are not destroyed, till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will spare them no longer. The wine-press is the wrath of God, some terrible calamity, probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. The patience of God towards sinners, is the greatest miracle in the world; but, though lasting, it will not be everlasting; and ripeness in sin is a sure proof of judgment at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I looked - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>. His attention is arrested by a new vision. The Son of man himself comes forth to close the scene, and to wind up the affairs of the world. This, too, is of the nature of an episode, and the design is the same as the previous visions - to support the mind in the prospect of the trials that the church was to experience, by the assurance that it would be finally triumphant, and that every enemy would be destroyed.<p>And behold a white cloud - Bright, splendid, dazzling - appropriate to be the seat of the Son of God.

It is probable that there is here a designed reference to the passage in Daniel. The meaning is, that one appeared on the cloud in a human form, whom John at once recognized as he to whom the appellation of "the Son of man" especially belonged - the Lord Jesus. The meaning of that term had not been fixed in the time of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>; subsequently it was appropriated by the Saviour, and was the favorite term by which he chose to speak of himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm">Matthew 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>, et al.<p>Having on his head a golden crown - Appropriate to him as king. It was mainly in virtue of his kingly power and office that the work was to be done which John is now about to describe.<p>And in his hand a sharp sickle - The word "sickle" here - &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  drepanon - means a crooked knife or scythe for gathering the harvest, or vintage, by cutting off the clusters of grapes. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-17.htm">Revelation 14:17</a>. The image of a harvest is often employed in the New Testament to describe moral subjects, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-29.htm">Mark 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-2.htm">Luke 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>. Here the reference is to the consummation of all things, when the great harvest of the world will be reaped, and when all the enemies of the church will be cut off - for that is the grand idea which is kept before the mind in this chapter. In various forms, and by various images, that idea had already been presented to the mind, but here it is introduced in a grand closing image; as if the grain of the harvest-field were gathered in - illustrating the reception of the righteous into the kingdom - and the fruit of the vineyard were thrown into the wine-press, representing the manner in which the wicked would be crushed, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. crown&#8212;Greek, "stephanon," "garland" of victory; not His diadem as a king.

Seeing that having been called back by word both publicly and privately to his duty and admonished of his certain ruin, he does not cease to maintain and protect his own adherents, that they may serve him: and to afflict the godly with most barbarous persecutions. Of those things which Christ does, there are two forms: one common or general in the rest of this chapter another specific against that savage and rebellious beast and his worshippers in chapter fifteen and sixteen. The common form is the calamity of wars, spread abroad through the whole earth, and filling all things with blood and without respect of any person. This is figured or shadowed in two types, of the harvest and vintage. Have you seen how since the time that the light of the gospel began to shine out, and since prophecy or preaching by the grace of God was raised up again, horrible wars have been kindled in the world? how much human flesh has been thrown to the earth by this divine reaping? how much blood (alas for woe) has overflown for these 100 years almost? all history cries out, and our age (if ever before) is now in horror by reason of the rage of the sickle which Antichrist calls for. In this place is the first type, that is of the harvest.<p>(10) Declaring his fierceness by his colour, like that which is in the white or milk circle of heaven<p>(11) As one that shall reign from God, and occupy the place of Christ in this miserable execution.<p>(12) That is, a most fit and convenient instrument of execution, destroying all by showing and thrusting through: for who may stand against God?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle....">Revelation 14:14-16</a>. In the first picture of the ripeness of the earth for judgment,[3541] it is the coming Judge himself who appears on a white cloud, with a sharp sickle in his hand. It is of like significance, when, from the first of the seals,[3542] the victorious form of the Lord himself proceeds.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The description (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14</a>) allows us to think only of Christ himself,[3543] but could not mean an angel,[3544] who possibly represented Christ,[3545] or “the heroes and chiefs who, armed with zeal for the truth, plead the cause of the Church, and executed the judgments of God.”[3546] Decisive is the solemn designation <span class="greekheb">ὅμοιον υἱῷ ἀνθρώπου</span>;[3547] also the appearance on the cloud,[3548] and the golden crown indicating a special glory as victor,[3549] make the reference to Christ himself still more certain.

(<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-15.htm" title="And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle, and reap: for the time is come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.">Revelation 14:15</a>), besides, does not compel us here[3550] to understand an angel also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14</a>, because the <span class="greekheb">ἄλλος</span> alludes to the angels mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm" title="And I saw another angel fly in the middle of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,">Revelation 14:6</a> sqq,[3551] and the objection that Christ himself could not have received a command[3552] from an angel, is settled by the fact that the angel is only the bearer of the command coming from God.[3553] See, also, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-17.htm" title="And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:17</a><span class="greekheb">καθήμενον</span>.

The strange picture of messiah (14 f., contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.">Revelation 19:11</a> f.), the absence of any allusion to the Beasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-9.htm" title="And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,...">Revelation 14:9-11</a>) or to the Imperial cultus, the peculiar angelology, and the generally disparate nature of the scene as compared with the context, point to the isolated character of the episode. The abrupt mention of <span class="ital">the city</span> (20) suggests that the tradition belonged to the cycle underlying <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein....">Revelation 11:1-13</a> (<span class="ital">the city</span>, 13), and several critics (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Spitta, Erbes, Weyland, Völter, Schon, Briggs, Rauch) regard it variously as a finâle to the oracles of that chapter. But the connexion is one of tradition rather than of literary unity. The data of style and content leave it uncertain even whether the episode goes back to a source or a tradition, whether it is Jewish (so especially Sabatier, Pfleiderer, and Rauch) or Jewish Christian (Schön, Erbes, Bruston, J. Weiss, etc.), and, if Jewish Christian, whether it was written by the author of the Apocalypse (Weizsäcker) or not. The least obscure feature is the victory of the messiah over antichrist and his legions (not of an angelic judgment on Israel, J. Weiss) in the vicinity of Jerusalem (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm" title="And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.">Revelation 11:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a> f., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm" title="And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.">Revelation 20:9</a>) at the end of the world, an expectation of which we have another variant apparently in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.">Revelation 19:11</a> f. Probably the prophet inserts the episode here in order to repeat, in a graphic and archaic, although somewhat incongruous fashion, the final doom of which he has just been speaking and to which he is about to lead up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-15.htm" title="And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle, and reap: for the time is come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe....">Revelation 14:15-20</a>.) through a fresh series of catastrophes. “If one might venture to wish to discard as an interpolation any part of the attested text of the Apocalypse, it would be this passage. How can it be understood of anything but the final judgment? Yet it comes here as anything but final.… The earth goes on just as before” (Simcox). But here, as often elsewhere, the clue lies partly in the vivid inconsequence of dream-pictures, partly in the preacher’s desire to impress his hearers, and partly in the poetic, imaginative freedom of his own mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">I looked</span>] Better, <span class="bld">beheld</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.">Revelation 4:1</a>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">one sat</span>] More literally, [I saw] <span class="bld">One sitting</span>. It is scarcely possible to doubt that a vision of the Last Judgement is here interposed, to encourage “the patience of the Saints” that is to be so sorely tried.

Even so, Amen.">Revelation 1:7</a>, except from a desire to interpret the whole series of visions continuously, as fulfilled in chronological order. Now it is probably right to regard the order of the visions as always significant, and generally answering to the chronological order of fulfilment. But exceptions to the latter rule must be admitted: <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a> plainly refers to the same events as chap. 13, while chap. 12 goes back to events earlier than, probably, any others indicated in the Book. In this chapter itself, we have in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a></span> an anticipation of chap. 18: we need not therefore hesitate to suppose that here we have an anticipation of chap. 20.
