It was a seat of idolatry and persecution, and is not; not in the ancient form, which was pagan: yet it is; it is truly the seat of idolatry and tyranny, though of another sort and form. It would deceive into stupid and blind submission all the inhabitants of the earth within its influence, except the remnant of the elect. This beast was seven heads, seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings, seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy was written; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast, directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry again. It had ten horns, which are said to be ten kings who had as yet no kingdoms; they should not rise up till the Roman empire was broken; but should for a time be very zealous in her interest. Christ must reign till all enemies be put under his feet. The reason of the victory is, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supreme dominion and power over all things; all the powers of earth and hell are subject to his control. His followers are called to this warfare, are fitted for it, and will be faithful in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These shall make war with the Lamb - The Lamb of God - the Lord Jesus (See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>); that is, they would combine with the papacy in opposing evangelical religion. It is not meant that they would openly and avowedly proclaim war against the Son of God, but that they would practically do this in sustaining a persecuting power. It is unnecessary to show how true this has been in history; how entirely they sustained the papacy in all its measures of persecution.<p>And the Lamb shall overcome them - Shall ultimately gain the victory over them. The meaning is, that they would not be able to extinguish the true religion. In spite of all opposition and persecution, that would still live in the world, until it would be said that a complete triumph was gained.<p>For he is Lord of lords, and King of kings - He has supreme power over all the earth, and all kings and princes are subject to his control. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>.<p>And they that are with him - The reference is to the persecuted saints who have adhered to him as his faithful followers in all these protracted conflicts.<p>Are called - That is, called by him to be his followers; as if he had selected them out of the world to maintain his cause.

In their steadfast adherence to the truth, they had shown that they were truly chosen by the Saviour, and could be relied on in the warfare against the powers of evil.<p>And faithful - They had shown themselves faithful to him in times of persecution, and in the hour of darkness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

The Lord Jesus Christ, so often spoken of in this book under this character, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>. And this war is not to be understood of a war with him personally, or of that last and decisive, battle at Armageddon, in which will be the kings of the earth; but of a war with his members, of their persecuting of the saints, and faithful witnesses of Christ in all ages, within their jurisdictions, being instigated to it by the beast, under whose influence they are: <p>and the Lamb shall overcome them: partly through the constancy of his people, who will not love their lives to the death, but freely lay them down for him; nor can anything separate them from the love of Christ, or prevail upon them to desert him, his truths and ordinances, cause and interest, but are more than conquerors through him, and so he overcomes in them; and partly through a reformation which he effects, as in some of those kingdoms already, as Sweden, Denmark, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and others, and will do in others hereafter; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a><p>for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; he is so by nature, as God and Creator, to whom the kingdom of nature and providence belongs; and by office, as Mediator, being made higher than the kings of the earth; hence he is more than a match for them, they cannot stand before him; this is a reason why he overcomes them, and it cannot be thought it should be otherwise: this Lamb is the lion of the tribe of Judah, and when he rouses himself, and stirs up his wrath, and exerts his power, kings and great men flee from him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a>. This is a proof of Christ's proper deity, the same titles being given to him, the Word and Son of God, as to God himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>. <p>And they that are with him: his servants and his soldiers, that fight under him, and abide by him, <p>are called, and chosen, and faithful; they are chosen in Christ from all eternity, to grace here, and glory hereafter, and so stand opposed to the admirers of the beast, whose names are not written in the book of life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a> for this is to be understood of their eternal election, and not of their separation by the effectual calling in time, for that is expressed by their being "called"; and though their calling is here set before election, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm">2 Peter 1:10</a> yet it does not precede it; the Arabic version reads, "chosen, called, faithful"; first "chosen" by God the Father, then "called", not with the bare external call by the ministry of the word, for, so, many are called, and not chosen; but by special grace to special benefits, and with an holy and heavenly calling, and which is irresistible, and without repentance; and being called they remain "faithful": the meaning is, either that they have faith, or are believers in Christ; which faith they have bestowed on them in the effectual calling, as a fruit of electing grace; and by this they overcome the world: or else, that they are persons of integrity and uprightness, that are on the side of Christ; they are the faithful in the Lord, and are made so by him; and they are faithful to him, and abide by his Gospel and ordinances, and in his cause and interest, even unto death; and so this character is expressive of the perseverance of those who are chosen and called, even unto the end. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">These shall make war with the <span class="cverse3">{30}</span> Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him <i>are</i> called, and chosen, and faithful.</span><p>(30) With Christ and his Church, as the reason following declares, and here are mentioned the facts and events which followed for Christ's sake, and for the grace of God the Father towards those that are elected, called, and are his faithful ones in Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/revelation/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm" title="These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.">Revelation 17:14</a>.

This is the first time that John brings the Lamb on the scene of earthly action.

This war between the Lamb and the powers of evil is that which extends throughout the history of the world (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>); it occupies the "one hour" of ver. 12, which is equivalent to the period of the world's existence. But the seer in this verse looks forward also to the termination of the conflict, the result of which, here briefly indicated, is soon to be narrated more fully. <span class="cmt_word">For he is Lord of lords, and King of kings.</span> This is the reason given to the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>) for obedience to God (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). Though the beast may exercise m this world dominion and power as "prince of this world," yet the Lamb is King still greater, to whom the beast must finally succumb. He is thus <span class="accented">King</span> above the kings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2, 10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</span> The Revised Version is more correct, <span class="accented">And they that are with him, called and chosen and faithful</span> [<span class="accented">shall also overcome</span>]. Another evidence of the lifelong nature of this war. Not only Christ wars and overcomes, but those associated with him are permitted to share in the battle and the victory.
