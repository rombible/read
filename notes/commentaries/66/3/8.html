He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens a door of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, opens the heart. He shuts the door of heaven against the foolish, who sleep away their day of grace; and against the workers of iniquity, how vain and confident soever they may be. The church in Philadelphia is commended; yet with a gentle reproof. Although Christ accepts a little strength, yet believers must not rest satisfied in a little, but strive to grow in grace, to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Christ can discover this his favour to his people, so that their enemies shall be forced to acknowledge it. This, by the grace of Christ, will soften their enemies, and make them desire to be admitted into communion with his people. Christ promises preserving grace in the most trying times, as the reward of past faithfulness; To him that hath shall be given. Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace, shall be kept by Christ in an hour of temptation; and the same Divine grace that has made them fruitful in times of peace, will make them faithful in times of persecution. Christ promises a glorious reward to the victorious believer. He shall be a monumental pillar in the temple of God; a monument of the free and powerful grace of God; a monument that shall never be defaced or removed. On this pillar shall be written the new name of Christ; by this will appear, under whom the believer fought the good fight, and came off victorious.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I know thy works - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>.<p>Behold, I have set before thee an open door - Referring to his authority as stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>. The "open door" here evidently refers to the enjoyment of some privilege or honor; and, so far as the language is concerned, it may refer to any one of the following things - either:<p>(1) the ability to do good - represented as the "opening of the door." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>.<p>(2) the privilege of access to the heavenly palace; that is, that they had an abundant opportunity of securing their salvation, the door being never closed against them by day or by night. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25</a>. Or.<p>(3) it may mean that they had before them an open way of egress from danger and persecution.<p>This latter Prof. Stuart supposes to be the true meaning; and argues this because it is immediately specified that those Jewish persecutors would be made to humble themselves, and that the church would but lightly experience the troubles which were coming upon the world around them. But the more natural interpretation of the phrase "an open door" is that it refers to access to a thing rather than egress from a thing; that we may come to what we desire to approach, rather than escape from what we dread. There is no objection, it seems to me, to the supposition that the language may be used here in the largest sense - as denoting that, in regard to the church at Philadelphia, there was no restraint. He had given them the most unlimited privileges. The temple of salvation was thrown open to them; the celestial city was accessible; the whole world was before them as a field of usefulness, and anywhere, and everywhere, they might do good, and at all times they might have access to the kingdom of God.<p>And no man can shut it - No one has the power of preventing this, for he who has control over all things concedes these privileges to you.<p>For then hast a little strength - This would imply that they had not great vigor, but still that, notwithstanding there were so many obstacles to their doing good, and so many temptations to evil, there still remained with them some degree of energy. They were not wholly dead; and as long as that was the case, the door was still open for them to do good. The words "little strength" may refer either to the smallness of the number - meaning that they were few; or it may refer to the spiritual life and energy of the church - meaning that, though feeble, their vital energy was not wholly gone. The more natural interpretation seems to be to refer it to the latter; and the sense is, that although they had not the highest degree of energy, or had not all that the Saviour desired they should have, they were not wholly dead. The Saviour saw among them the evidences of spiritual life; and in view of that he says he had set before them an open door, and there was abundant opportunity to employ all the energy and zeal which they had. It may be remarked that the same thing is true now; that wherever there is any vitality in a church, the Saviour will furnish ample opportunity that it may be employed in his service.<p>And hast not denied my name - When Christians were brought before pagan magistrates in times of persecution, they were required to renounce the name of Christ, and to disown him in a public manner. It is possible that, amidst the persecutions that raged in the early times, the members of the church at Philadelphia had been summoned to such a trial, and they had stood the trial firmly. It would seem from the following verse, that the efforts which had been made to induce them to renounce the name of Christ had been made by those who professed to be Jews, though they evinced the spirit of Satan. If so, then the attempt was probably to convince them that Jesus was not the Christ. This attempt would be made in all places where there were Jews. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. I have set&#8212;Greek, "given": it is My gracious gift to thee.<p>open door&#8212;for evangelization; a door of spiritual usefulness. The opening of a door by Him to the Philadelphian Church accords with the previous assignation to Him of "the key of David."<p>and&#8212;The three oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, and Origen read, "which no man can shut."<p>for&#8212;"because."<p>a little&#8212;This gives the idea that Christ says, He sets before Philadelphia an open door because she has some little strength; whereas the sense rather is, He does so because she has "but little strength": being consciously weak herself, she is the fitter object for God's power to rest on [so Aquinas], that so the Lord Christ may have all the glory.<p>and hast kept&#8212;and so, the littleness of thy strength becoming the source of Almighty power to thee, as leading thee to rest wholly on My great power, thou hast kept My word. Grotius makes "little strength" to mean that she had a Church small in numbers and external resources: "a little flock poor in worldly goods, and of small account in the eyes of men" [Trench]. So Alford. I prefer the view given above. The Greek verbs are in the aorist tense: "Thou didst keep &#8230; didst not deny My name": alluding to some particular occasion when her faithfulness was put to the test.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I know thy works:</span> it is very probable, that our Lord, by these ministers’ works, understands the works proper to them in their function, their labour in preaching and propagating the gospel, which Christ did not only know and observe, but also approve of, and promiseth them a liberty to go on, and success in their labours, under the notion of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">an open door:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm" title="For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.">1 Corinthians 16:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2 Corinthians 2:12</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And no man can shut it; </span> so as it should not be in the power of adversaries to hinder his success. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For thou hast a little strength; </span> both inward strength, and outward helps and advantages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And hast kept my word; </span> the doctrine of faith is by thee kept pure, as also my precepts for a holy life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And hast not denied my name; </span> and thou hast not been by any temptation prevailed upon to apostatize from the profession of the gospel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I know thy works,.... Good works, of faith, love, and patience; and which lay much in preaching, professing, and maintaining the pure Gospel, and in acts of charity to one another; and which were done to some degree of perfection, and with great sincerity; since this church is not complained of, that her works were not perfect before God, as the former church is: <p>behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it; or "which no man can shut", as read the Alexandrian copy, and others, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions. This "open door" may design an uncommon opportunity of preaching the Gospel; and a very great freedom of mind in the preachers of it, and great attention in the hearers, whose hearts will be opened to observe, receive, and embrace it; and a very large gathering in of souls to Christ, and his churches; much and frequent preaching of the word with great success, which it will not be in the power of any creature to stop or hinder: now will the abundance of the sea, the forces of the Gentiles flow in, and the nation of the Jews shall be born at once, <p>For thou hast a little strength; which is not to be understood of inward spiritual strength, for of this the church in this period will have a great deal, as well as of courage and fortitude of mind, but outward power and authority: some great men, and princes of the earth, will come into the churches of Christ, even kings will come to the brightness of her rising; for now will all those prophesies have their accomplishment, which respect the secular grandeur of the church, with regard to its numbers, power, and riches; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>. <p>And hast kept my word; both the commands and ordinances of Christ in practice, and that in their primitive purity, as they were delivered by Christ and his apostles, particularly baptism and the Lord's supper; which have been, one or other of them, or both, most sadly corrupted in all the periods of the churches hitherto, excepting the apostolical one, but will now be restored to their pristine purity and glory; and also the doctrines of the Gospel, which will be kept, not in memory only, but in the heart and life; they will be publicly and openly preached, professed, and defended: <p>and hast not denied my name: Christ himself, his doctrine respecting his person, office, and grace, neither in words, nor in works, but both ways confessed and owned it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</span><p>(7) The note of praise is in this verse of promises, and Re 3:9 to bring home again them that wander, in Re 3:10 to preserve the godly and in Re 3:11 to exhort.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-8.htm" title="I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.">Revelation 3:8</a>. With <span class="greekheb">οἷδά σου τὰ ἔργα</span> we are not to immediately combine the <span class="greekheb">ὅτι μικρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δυν</span>. as though the latter words[1426] contain an explicit statement of the <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span>;[1427] for, in a formal respect, it is impracticable to regard the entire clause <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀυτήν</span> as a parenthesis; and, as to the subject, the point expressed in the assumed parenthesis belongs already also in the idea of <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔργα</span>. But[1428] by the words <span class="greekheb">οἷδά σου τὰ ἔργα</span>, the Lord testifies chiefly, without any further determination, that every thing is known to him with which the church in its present life is engaged.[1429] To the church at Philadelphia this is a word of commendation and consolation. This results from the words of the Lord which immediately follow: <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>, <span class="greekheb">δέδωκα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., in which the thought is expressed that the fidelity maintained by the church, notwithstanding its external helplessness, depends not only upon a gracious gift of the Lord, but also serves the purpose,—and that, too, again through his government,—that through the faithful church the Lord’s kingdom is increased. This sense depends chiefly upon the correct interpretation of the figurative expression <span class="greekheb">δεδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θύραν ἀνεῳγμένην</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The door is opened, viz., either in order that the church itself may enter,[1430] or in order that by means of the church others may enter.[1431] According to the former idea, N. de Lyra,[1432] etc., explain: “a door is opened for understanding the Scriptures.” Arethas: <span class="greekheb">τὴν εἴσοδον πρὸς ἀπολαυσιν</span> (“entrance to fruition”). Bengel: “Entrance into the joy of thy Lord, and meanwhile into unhindered progress in all good.” Eichh.: “Entrance to me lies open to thee;” in the shallow sense: “I desire well for thee.”[1433] Züllig: “Entrance into the temple.” Hengstenb.:[1434] “Entrance to the house of David, or the kingdom of God.” According to another mode of representation, it is explained by Andr., Rib., Alcas., C. a Lap., Stern, Grot., Calov., Vitr., Wolf, Ew., De Wette, Ebrard, etc., who think of the favorable and successful opportunity for the missionary activity of the church. A decision in favor of this explanation, and that, too, in reference, not to heathen,[1435] but to Jews who are to be won by the fidelity of the believing church, is made by the connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>. A special intimation of the connection of <span class="greekheb">δέδωκα</span>, <span class="greekheb">διδῶ</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ποιήσω</span>, lies even in the threefold <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>.[1436] A declaration concerning the entrance of’ the church into heavenly joy, of which alone, according to the first mode of statement, we can think, could scarcely be made at the very beginning of the epistle. The statement correctly understood stands, consequently, in close connection with the designation of the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things said he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;">Revelation 3:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔχων τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κλεῖν Δ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and emphasizes a special point, corresponding to the further contents of the epistle, of the supreme power in reference to his kingdom, to be ascribed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things said he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;">Revelation 3:7</a>, in unlimited universality, to the Lord; i.e., Christ expressly, and with visible results, attests his Davidic power of the keys in this, that he has opened a door before his faithful and steadfast church, through which a multitude of still unbelieving Jews are to enter. For the words <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>, <span class="greekheb">ποιήσω αὐτοὺς ἵνα ἥξουσι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>, are in substance an exposition of <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>, <span class="greekheb">δεδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θύραν ἀνεῳγμένην</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., as they state the actual, but yet future, consequence of an opportunity already given (<span class="greekheb">δέδωκα</span>, perf.). That Christ can say of himself <span class="greekheb">δεδωκα</span> and <span class="greekheb">ποιήσω</span>, depends upon the fact that it is he who has the key of David.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιόν σου</span>. To be distinguished from <span class="greekheb">σοι</span>[1437] only in mode of contemplation, but not[1438] in substance. The Hebraic coloring of the formula[1439] corresponds well with the statement in this passage, and the style of the Apoc. in general.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The demonstrative <span class="greekheb">αὐτήν</span>, brought in after the relative <span class="greekheb">ἣν</span>, is also Hebraistic.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>. Incorrectly, Vitr.: “Even though.” Rather is that which immediately precedes based upon on <span class="greekheb">ὅτι μικρὰν ἔχεις δύναμιν καὶ ἐτήρησας</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The “little strength,” viz., of the church, cannot be explained by the lack of miraculous gifts,[1440] but refers to the smallness. of the church,[1441] which must also be regarded in destitution when compared with the richer Jews.[1442] As now with the <span class="greekheb">μικρὰν ἔχεις δύναμιν</span>, the <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐτήρησας</span> is combined, these two members of the sentence externally united by the mere <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> show themselves to have a definite inner relation: “and (yet) hast kept,” etc[1443] Concerning the subject itself, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-10.htm" title="Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come on all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.">Revelation 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-3.htm" title="And have borne, and have patience, and for my name's sake have labored, and have not fainted.">Revelation 2:3</a>. The church, therefore, already had had opportunity, as the aor. forms <span class="greekheb">ἐτήρησας</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἠρνήσω</span> indicate, to confess the Lord’s name in opposition to unbelievers,—apparently Jews and heathen. Therefore, because (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) the church has done this, although of insignificant outward power, the Lord has given it an “open door,” the meaning of which is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>. [See Note XXXVIII., p. 183.] Thus the idea is advanced, that the faithful, steadfast confession of the church, indicated especially in <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔργα</span>, is the cause whose effect and reward, through the Lord’s disposing (<span class="greekheb">δέδωκα</span>, cf. <span class="greekheb">διδῶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ποιήσω</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>), is to be the conversion of a number of his enemies. Faithful confessing has itself opened the door, but of course only because the Lord had given believers power for testimony. Thus the clause <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>, <span class="greekheb">δέδωκα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., stands upon the idea <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔργα</span>, and the whole (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-8.htm" title="I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.">Revelation 3:8</a>) upon the designation of the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things said he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;">Revelation 3:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1426] Cf. the <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1427] Bengel.

Some storm of persecution had burst upon him, probably at Smyrna, instigated by the Jews, or the Judaizing section of the church. They sought to shut the door which he had found open, and would have kept so. They were strong, and he was weak; numbers were against him, and one whose faith was less real and living might have yielded to the pressure. But he, though not winning, like Antipas, the martyr’s crown, had yet displayed the courage of the confessor. Like the faithful servant in the parable, he had thus been faithful in a very little (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-23.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:23</a>); and therefore, as the promise that follows shows, he was to be ‘made ruler over many things.’ ”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/revelation/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-8.htm" title="I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.">Revelation 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἶδά</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span> as in the case of Smyrna implying unqualified approval. The reward of this steadfastness (8 <span class="ital">c</span>, 10) is threefold: (<span class="ital">a</span>) security in their relation to God (8 <span class="ital">b</span>), through the love of Christ for them (9); (<span class="ital">b</span>) ultimate triumph over their foes (9), and (<span class="ital">c</span>) deliverance in the final crisis (10). The open door, here as in Paul (for the ethnic use of the term on sepulchres <span class="ital">cf. C. B. P.</span>, ii. 395) is usually taken to denote facilities for preaching and advancing the faith among outsiders, in which case the sense would be that the extension of the gospel depends upon, as it forms a high reward of, open confession and a decided stand for Christ. But in view of a passage written by Ignatius to this very church (<span class="ital">ad Philad.</span> 3, where Christ himself is termed <span class="greekheb">θύρα τοῦ πατρὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἧς εἰσέρχονται</span> the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, ͅ<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ ἐκκλησία</span>) and of Clem. Rom. xlviii. (where the gate of righteousness is described as open in Christ), the phrase is better connected with Christ himself, not with any good opening for Christian activity. He makes access to God through himself sure; despite trials and temptations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/3-8.htm" title="I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name....">Revelation 3:8-10</a>) his church’s standing is guaranteed by his authority (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.">John 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm" title="I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.">John 10:9</a>, Christ <span class="greekheb">ἡ θύρα τῶν προβάτων</span>). <span class="greekheb">θύρα</span> here is the open heart of God for man; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>, man’s open heart for God. Jesus, then, equipped with the O.T. attributes of divine authority, assures the church how futile are such excommunications as the Jews were levelling against them. The latter have nothing to do with the conditions of the kingdom. Faith in Jesus constitutes a relation to God which cannot either be impaired or rivalled. Only, the perseverance of the saints is needed; an assured position with God depends not merely on Christ’s will and power but on Christian loyalty as the coefficient of grace. The church at 2 Peter is not blamed for the slenderness of her equipment, which evidently is due to causes outside her control. She is praised for having made good use of the slight resources she possessed (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-8.htm" title="She has done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying.">Mark 14:8</a>).

Once more Christ's judgment is based upon intimate personal knowledge. A question arises whether the next sentence, introduced by "behold," should be parenthetical or not. It is possible, as in the Authorized Version and previous English versions, and also in the Vulgate, to avoid what is certainly an awkward parenthesis. On the other hand, it seems clear that in ver. 1 and ver. 15 <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> depends upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, "I know thy works, <span class="accented">that</span> thou," and does not introduce a fresh sentence; "I know thy works: <span class="accented">for</span> thou." Then must not <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> depend upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> here? But either arrangement makes good sense, and perhaps the omission of the parenthesis makes the best sense: <span class="accented">"Because</span> thou hast little power, and hast made a good use of that little, I have given thee an opportunity of which none shall deprive thee." This seems to be the obvious meaning of the"opened door," in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>. The Philadelphian Church, in spite of its small advantages, whether in numbers or prosperity, kept Christ's word when called upon to deny him; and for this it shall ever have the privilege of giving others an entrance into Christ's fold. The aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, appear to point to some definite occasion. On "keep my word," see notes on Revelation 1:3 and Revelation 2:26. The antithetic parallelism, "didst keep and didst not deny," is thoroughly in St. John's style, and is one of many instances of the Hebrew cast of his language (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-5.htm">John 10:5, 18</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 10, 11, 27, 28</a>).

This is variously explained. Some refer it to the entrance into the joy of the Lord; others to the initiation into the meaning of scripture; others again to the opportunity for the mission-work of the Church. In this last sense the phrase is often used by Paul. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>.
