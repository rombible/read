There may be reference to the frequent earthquakes which had shaken down buildings in their city. Those who overcome will prove real supports to the great Christian temple. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Write upon him.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">grave upon it.</span> On the sides of the four marble pillars which survive as ruins of Philadelphia inscriptions are to be found. The writing would be the name of God, the name of the heavenly Jerusalem and (omit the repetition, “I will write upon him”) the new, unknown name of Christ Himself. The allusion is to the golden frontlet inscribed with the name of Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>.) He will reflect the likeness of God; and not only so, he will bear the tokens—now seen in all clearness—of his heavenly citizenship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>). And a further promise implies that in the day of the last triumph, as there will be new revealings of Christ’s power, there will be unfolded to the faithful and victorious new and higher possibilities of purity. Thus does Scripture refuse to recognise any finality which is not a beginning as well as an end—a landing-stage in the great law of continuity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/revelation/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Revelation<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">VI. - THE VICTOR’S LIFE-NAMES</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm" title="Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write on him my new name.">Revelation 3:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The eyes which were as a flame of fire saw nothing to blame in the Philadelphian Church, and the lips out of which came the two-edged sword that cuts through all hypocrisy to the discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart, spoke only eulogium- ‘Thou hast kept My word, and hast not denied My name.’ But however mature and advanced may be Christian experience, it is never lifted above the possibility of temptation; so, with praise, there came warning of an approaching hour which would try the mettle of this unblamed Church. Christ’s reward for faithfulness is not immunity from, but strength in, trial and conflict. As long as we are in the world there will be forces warring against us; and we shall have to fight our worst selves and the tendencies which tempt us to prefer the visible to the unseen, and the present to the future. So the Church which had no rebuke received the solemn injunction: ‘Hold fast that thou hast; let no man take thy crown.’ There is always need of struggle, even for the most mature, if we would keep what we have. The treasure will be filched from slack hands; the crown will be stricken from a slumbering head. So it is not inappropriate that the promise to this Church should be couched in the usual terms, ‘to him that overcometh,’ and the conclusion to be drawn is the solemn and simple one that the Christian life is always a conflict, even to the end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The promise contained in my text presents practically but a twofold aspect of that future blessedness; the one expressed in the clause, ‘I will make him a pillar’; the other expressed in the clauses referring to the writing upon him of certain names. I need not do more than again call attention to the fact that here, as always, Jesus Christ represents Himself as not only allocating the position and determining the condition, but as shaping, and moulding, and enriching the characters of the redeemed, and ask you to ponder the question. What in Him does that assumption involve? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Passing on, then, to the consideration of these two promises more closely, let us deal with them singly. There is, first, the steadfast pillar; there is, second, the threefold inscription. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The steadfast pillar. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now I take it that the two clauses which refer to this matter are closely connected. ‘I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go no more out.’ In the second clause the figure is dropped, and the point of the metaphor is brought out more clearly. The stately column in the temples, with which these Philadelphian Christians, dwelling in the midst of the glories of Greek architecture, were familiar, might be, and often has been, employed as a symbol of many things. Here it cannot mean the office of sustaining a building, or pre-eminence above others, as it naturally lends itself sometimes to mean. For instance, the Apostle Paul speaks of the three chief apostles in Jerusalem, and says that they ‘seemed to be pillars’; by which pre-eminence and the office of maintaining the Church are implied. But that obviously cannot be the special application of the figure here, inasmuch as we cannot conceive of even redeemed men sustaining that temple in the heavens, and also inasmuch as the promise here is perfectly universal, and is given to all that overcome - that is to say, to all the redeemed. We must, therefore, look in some other direction. Now, the second of the two clauses which are thus linked together seems to me to point in the direction in which we are to look. ‘He shall go no more out.’ A pillar is a natural emblem of stability and permanence, as poets in many tongues and in many lands have felt it to be. I remember one of our own quaint English writers who speaks of men who are bottomed on the basis of a firm faith, mounting up with the clear shaft of a shining life, and having their persevering tops garlanded about, according to God’s promise, ‘I will give thee a crown of life.’ That idea of stability, of permanence, of fixedness, is the one that is prominent in the metaphor here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But whilst the general notion is that of stability and permanence, do not let us forget that it is permanence and stability in a certain direction, for the pillar is ‘in the temple of My God.’ Now I would recall to you the fact that in other parts of Scripture we find the present relation of Christian men to God set forth under a similar metaphor: ‘Ye are the temple of the living God’; or again, ‘In whom ye are builded for a habitation of God through the Spirit’; or again, in that great word which is the foundation of all such symbols, ‘We will come and make our abode with Him.’ So that the individual believer and the community of all such are, even here and now, the dwelling-place of God. And whilst there are ideas of dignity and grace attaching to the metaphor of the pillar, the underlying meaning of it is substantially that the individual souls of redeemed men shall be themselves parts of, and collectively shall constitute, the temple of God in the heavens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This book of the Apocalypse has several points of view in regard to that great symbol. It speaks, for instance, of there being no temple therein,’ by which is meant the cessation of all material and external worships such as belong to earth. It speaks also of God and the Lamb as themselves being ‘the Temple thereof.’ And here we have the converse idea that not only may we think of the redeemed community as dwelling in God and Christ, but of God and Christ as dwelling in the redeemed community. The promise, then, is of a thrilling consciousness that God is in us, a deeper realization of His presence, a fuller communication of His grace, a closer touch of Him, far beyond anything that we can conceive of on earth, and yet being the continuation and the completion of the earthly experiences of those in whom God dwells by their faith, their love, and their obedience. We have nothing to say about the new capacities for consciousness of God which may come to redeemed souls when the veils of flesh and sense, and the absorption in the present drop away. "We have nothing to say, because we know nothing about the new manifestations and more intimate touches which may correspond to these new capacities. There are vibrations of sounds too rapid or too slow for our ears as at present organized to catch. But whether these be too shrill or too deep to be heard, if the ear were more sensitive there would be sound where there is silence, and music in the waste places. So with new organs, with new capacities, there will be a new and a deeper sense of the presence of God; and utterances of His lips too profound to be caught by us now, or too clear and high to be apprehended by our limited sense, will then thunder into melody and with clear notes sound His praises. There are rays of light in the spectrum, at both ends of it, as yet not perceptible to human eyes; but then ‘we shall, in Thy light, see light ‘flaming higher and deeper than we can do now. We dwell in God here if we dwell in Christ, and we dwell in Christ if He dwell in us, by faith and love. But in the heavens the indwelling shall be more perfect, and transcend all that we know now. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The special point in regard to which that perfection is expressed here is to be kept prominent. ‘He shall go no more out.’ Permanence, and stability, and uninterruptedness in the communion and consciousness of an indwelling God, is a main element in the glory and blessedness of that future life. Stability in any fashion comes as a blessed hope to us, who know the curse of constant change, and are tossing on the unquiet waters of life. It is blessed to think of a region where the seal of permanence will be set on all delights, and our blessedness will be like the bush in the desert, burning and yet not consumed. But the highest form of that blessedness is the thought of stable, uninterrupted, permanent communion with God and consciousness of His dwelling in us. The contrast forces itself upon us between that equable and unvarying communion and the ups and downs of the most uniform Christian life here - to-day thrilling in every nerve with the sense of God, to-morrow dead and careless. Sometimes the bay is filled with flashing waters that leap in the sunshine; sometimes, when the tide is out, there is only a long stretch of grey and oozy mud. It shall not be always so. Like lands on the equator, where the difference between midsummer and midwinter is scarcely perceptible, either in length of day or in degree of temperature, that future will be a calm continuance, a uniformity which is not monotony, and a stability which does not exclude progress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I cannot but bring into contrast with that great promise he shall go no more out ‘an incident in the gospels. Christ and the Twelve were in the upper room, and He poured out His heart to them, and their hearts burned within them. But they went out to the Mount of Olives ‘- He to Gethsemane and to Calvary; Judas to betray and Peter to deny; all to toil and suffer, and sometimes to waver in their faith. ‘He shall go no more out.’ Eternal glory and unbroken communion is the blessed promise to the victor who is made by Christ ‘a pillar in the temple of My God.’ <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Now, secondly, notice the threefold inscription. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have done with the metaphor of the pillar altogether. We are not to think of anything so incongruous as a pillar stamped with writing, a monstrosity in Grecian architecture. But it is the man himself on whom Christ is to write the threefold name. The writing of a name implies ownership and visibility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So the first of the triple inscriptions declares that the victor shall be conspicuously God’s. ‘I will write upon him the name of My God.’ There may possibly be an allusion to the golden plate which flamed in the front of the high priest’s mitre, and on which was written the unspoken name of Jehovah. But whether that be so or no, the underlying ideas are these two which I have already referred to - complete ownership, and that manifested in the very front of the character. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How do we possess one another? How do we belong to God? How does God belong to us? There is but one way by which a spirit can possess a spirit - by love, which leads to self-surrender and to practical obedience. And if - as a man writes his name in his books, as a farmer brands on his sheep and oxen the marks that express his ownership - on the redeemed there is written the name of God, that means, whatever else it may mean, perfect love, perfect self -surrender, perfect obedience, that the whole nature shall be owned, and know itself owned, and be glad to be owned, by God. That is the perfecting of the Christian relationship which is begun here on earth. And if we here yield ourselves to God and depart from that foolish and always frustrated attempt to be our own masters and owners, so escaping the misery and burden of self -hood, and entering into the liberty of the children of God, we shall reach that blessed state in which there will be no murmuring and incipient rebellions, no disturbance of our inward submission, no breach in our active obedience, no holding back of anything that we have or are; but we shall be wholly God’s - that is, wholly possessors of ourselves, and blessed thereby. ‘He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life, the same shall find it.’ And that Name will be stamped on us that every eye that looks, whoever they may be, shall know ‘whose we are and whom we serve.’ <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The second inscription declares that the victor conspicuously belongs to the City. Our time will not allow of my entering at all upon the many questions that gather round that representation of ‘the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven.’ I must content myself with simply pointing to the possible allusion here to the promise in the preceding letter to Sardis. There we were told that the victor’s name should not ‘be blotted out of the Book of Life’; and that Book of Life suggested the idea of the burgess-roll of the city, as well as the register of those that truly live. Here the same thought is suggested by a converse metaphor. The name of the victor is written on the rolls of the city, and the name of the city is stamped on the forehead of the victor. That is to say, the affinity which, even here and now, has knit men who believe in Jesus Christ to an invisible order, where is their true mother-city and metropolis, will then be uncontradicted by any inconsistencies, unobscured by the necessary absorption in daily duties and transient aims and interests, which often veils to others, and renders less conscious to ourselves, our true belonging to the city beyond the sea. The name of the city shall be stamped upon the victor. That, again, is the perfecting and the continuation of the central heart of the Christian life here, the consciousness that we are come to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and belong to another order of things than the visible and material around us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last of the triple inscriptions declares that the victor shall be conspicuously Christ’s. ‘I will write upon him My new name.’ All the three inscriptions link themselves, not with earlier, but with later parts of this most artistically constructed book of the Revelation; and in a subsequent portion of it we read of a new name of Christ’s, which no man knoweth save Himself. "What is that new name? It is an expression for the sum of the new revelations of what He is, which will flood the souls of the redeemed when they pass from earth. That new name will not obliterate the old one - God forbid! It will not do away with the ancient, earth-begun relation of dependence and faith and obedience. ‘Jesus Christ is the same . . . for ever’: and His name in the heavens, as upon earth, is Jesus the Saviour. But there are abysses in Him which no man moving amidst the incipiencies and imperfections of this infantile life of earth can understand. Not until we possess can we know the depths of wisdom and knowledge, and of all other blessed treasures which are stored in Him. Here we touch but the fringe of His great glory; yonder we shall penetrate to its central flame. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That new name no man fully knows, even when he has entered on its possession and carries it on his forehead; for the infinite Christ, who is the manifestation of the infinite God, can never be comprehended, much less exhausted, even by the united perceptions of a redeemed universe; but for ever and ever, more and more will well out from Him. His name shall last as long as the sun, and blaze when the sun himself is dead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘I will write upon him My new name’ was said to a church, and while the eulogium was, ‘Thou hast not denied My name.’ If we are to pierce the heart and the glory there, we must begin on its edges here. If the name is to be on our foreheads then, we must bear in our body the marks of the Lord Jesus - the brand of ownership impressed on the slave’s palm. In the strength of the name we can overcome; and if we overcome. His name will hereafter blaze on our foreheads - the token that we are completely His for ever, and the pledge that we shall be growingly made like unto Him. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 The same Lord Jesus has the key of government and authority in and over the church. He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens a door of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, opens the heart. He shuts the door of heaven against the foolish, who sleep away their day of grace; and against the workers of iniquity, how vain and confident soever they may be. The church in Philadelphia is commended; yet with a gentle reproof. Although Christ accepts a little strength, yet believers must not rest satisfied in a little, but strive to grow in grace, to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Christ can discover this his favour to his people, so that their enemies shall be forced to acknowledge it. This, by the grace of Christ, will soften their enemies, and make them desire to be admitted into communion with his people. Christ promises preserving grace in the most trying times, as the reward of past faithfulness; To him that hath shall be given. Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace, shall be kept by Christ in an hour of temptation; and the same Divine grace that has made them fruitful in times of peace, will make them faithful in times of persecution. Christ promises a glorious reward to the victorious believer. He shall be a monumental pillar in the temple of God; a monument of the free and powerful grace of God; a monument that shall never be defaced or removed. On this pillar shall be written the new name of Christ; by this will appear, under whom the believer fought the good fight, and came off victorious.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Him that overcometh - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>.<p>Will make a pillar in the temple of my God - See the introductory remarks to this epistle. The promised reward of faithfulness here is, that he who was victorious would be honored as if he were a pillar or column in the temple of God. Such a pillar or column was partly for ornament, and partly for support; and the idea here is, that in that temple he would contribute to its beauty and the justness of its proportions, and would see the same time be honored as if he were a pillar which was necessary for the support of the temple. It is not uncommon in the New Testament to represent the church as a temple, and Christians as parts of it. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>.<p>And he shall go no more out - He shall be permanent as a part of that spiritual temple. The idea of "going out" does not properly belong to a pillar; but the speaker here has in his mind the man, though represented as a column. The description of some parts would be applicable more directly to a pillar; in others more properly to a man. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>, for an illustration of the sentiment here. The main truth here is, that if we reach heaven, our happiness will be secure forever. We shall have the most absolute certainty that the welfare of the soul will no more be perilled; that we shall never be in danger of falling into temptation; that no artful foe shall ever have power to alienate our affections from God; that we shall never die. Though we may change our place, and may roam from world to world until we shall have surveyed all the wonders of creation, yet we shall never "go out of the temple of God." Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2</a>. When we reach the heavenly world our conflicts will be over, our doubts at an end. As soon as we cross the threshold we shall be greeted with the assurance, "he shall go no more out forever." That is to be our eternal abode, and whatever of joy, or felicity, or glory, that bright world can furnish, is to be ours. Happy moment I when, emerging from a world of danger and of doubt, the soul shall settle down into the calmness and peace of that state where there is the assurance of God himself that that world of bliss is to be its eternal abode!<p>And I will write upon him the name of my God - Considered as a pillar or column in the temple. The name of God would be conspicuously recorded on it to show that he belonged to God. The allusion is to a public edifice, on the columns of which the names of distinguished and honored persons were recorded; that is, where there is a public testimonial of the respect in which one whose name was thus recorded was held. The honor thus conferred on him "who should overcome" would be as great as if the name of that God whom he served, and whose favor and friendship he enjoyed, were inscribed on him in some conspicuous manner. The meaning is, that he would be known and recognized as belonging to God; the God of the Redeemer himself - indicated by the phrase, "the name of my God."<p>And the name of the city of my God - That is, indicating that he belongs to that city, or that the New Jerusalem is the city of his habitation. The idea would seem to be, that in this world, and in. all worlds wherever he goes and wherever he abides, he will be recognized as belonging to that holy city; as enjoying the rights and immunities of such a citizen.<p>Which is New Jerusalem - Jerusalem was the place where the temple was reared, and where the worship of God was celebrated. It thus came to be synonymous with the church - the dwelling-place of God on earth.<p>Which cometh down out of heaven from my God - See this explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a> ff. Of course this must be a figurative representation, but the idea is plain. It is:<p>(1) that the church is, in accordance with settled Scripture language, represented as a city - the abode of God on earth.<p>(2) that is, instead of being built here, or having an earthly origin, it has its origin in heaven.<p>It is as if it had been constructed there, and then sent down to earth ready formed. The type, the form, the whole structure is heavenly. It is a departure from all proper laws of interpretation to explain this literally, as if a city should be actually let down from heaven; and equally so to infer from this passage, and the others of similar import in this book, that a city will be literally reared for the residence of the saints. If the passage proves anything on either of these points, it is, that a great and splendid city, such as that described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, will literally come down from heavens. But who can believe that? Such an interpretation, however, is by no means necessary. The comparison of the church with a beautiful city, and the fact that it has its origin in heaven, is all that is fairly implied in the passage.<p>And I will write upon him my new name - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>. The reward, therefore, promised here is, that he who, by persevering fidelity, showed that he was a real friend of the Saviour, would be honored with a permanent abode in the holy city of his habitation, In the church redeemed and triumphant he would have a perpetual dwelling; and wherever he should be, there would be given him sure pledges that he belonged to him, and was recognized as a citizen of the heavenly world. To no higher honor could any man aspire; and yet that is an honor to which the most humble and lowly may attain by faith in the Son of God.<p>The Epistle to the Church at Laodicea<p>The contents of the epistle to the church at Laodicea <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a> are as follows:<p>(1) The usual salutation to the angel of the church, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>,<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. pillar in the temple&#8212;In one sense there shall be "no temple" in the heavenly city because there shall be no distinction of things into sacred and secular, for all things and persons shall be holy to the Lord. The city shall be all one great temple, in which the saints shall be not merely stones, as m the spiritual temple now on earth, but all eminent as pillars: immovably firm (unlike Philadelphia, the city which was so often shaken by earthquakes, Strabo [12 and 13]), like the colossal pillars before Solomon's temple, Boaz (that is, "In it is strength") and Jachin ("It shall be established"): only that those pillars were outside, these shall be within the temple.<p>my God&#8212;(See on [2681]Re 2:7).<p>go no more out&#8212;The Greek is stronger, never more at all.

The door shall be once for all shut, as well to shut safely in for ever the elect, as to shut out the lost (Mt 25:10; Joh 8:35; compare Isa 22:23, the type, Eliakim). They shall be priests for ever unto God (Re 1:6). "Who would not yearn for that city out of which no friend departs, and into which no enemy enters?" [Augustine in Trench].<p>write upon him the name of my God&#8212;as belonging to God in a peculiar sense (Re 7:3; 9:4; 14:1; and especially Re 22:4), therefore secure. As the name of Jehovah ("Holiness to the Lord") was on the golden plate on the high priest's forehead (Ex 28:36-38); so the saints in their heavenly royal priesthood shall bear His name openly, as consecrated to Him. Compare the caricature of this in the brand on the forehead of the beast's followers (Re 13:16, 17), and on the harlot (Re 17:5; compare Re 20:4).<p>name of the city of my God&#8212;as one of its citizens (Re 21:2, 3, 10, which is briefly alluded to by anticipation here). The full description of the city forms the appropriate close of the book.

This was the city which Abraham looked for.<p>new&#8212;Greek, "kaine." Not the old Jerusalem, once called "the holy city," but having forfeited the name. Greek, "nea," would express that it had recently come into existence; but Greek, "kaine," that which is new and different, superseding the worn-out old Jerusalem and its polity. "John, in the Gospel, applies to the old city the Greek name Hierosolyma. But in the Apocalypse, always, to the heavenly city the Hebrew name, Hierousalem. The Hebrew name is the original and holier one: the Greek, the recent and more secular and political one" [Bengel].<p>my new name&#8212;at present incommunicable and only known to God: to be hereafter revealed and made the believer's own in union with God in Christ.

These local circumstances (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Juv. vi. 411; Dio Cass. lxviii. 25; Renan, 335) lend colour to this promise, which would also appeal to citizens of a city whose numerous festivals and temples are said to have won for it the sobriquet of “a miniature Athens” (<span class="ital">E. Bi.</span> 3692). The promise is alluded to in Ep. Lugd., where God’s grace is said to have “delivered the weak and set them up as <span class="greekheb">στύλους ἑδραίους</span> able by means of their patience to stand all angry onsets of the evil one,” and Attalus of Pergamos is termed a <span class="greekheb">στύλον καὶ ἑδραίωμα</span> of the local Christians. Permanent communion with God is further expressed in terms of the widespread ethnic belief that to be ignorant of a god’s name meant inability to worship him, whereas to know that name implied the power of entering into fellowship with him. “Just as writing a name on temple-walls puts the owner of the name in continual union with the deity of the temple, so for early man the knowledge, invocation and vain repetition of the deity’s name constitutes in itself an actual, if mystic, union with the deity named” (Jevons’ <span class="ital">Introd. Hist. Religion</span>, 1896, p. 245; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Jastrow, p. 173). <span class="greekheb">καὶ γράψω</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., inscriptions upon pillars being a common feature of Oriental architecture, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Cooke’s <span class="ital">North Semitic Inscriptions</span>, p. 266, names on pillars; also Reitzenstein’s <span class="ital">Poimandres</span>, 20. The provincial priest of the Imperial cultus erected his statue in the temple at the close of his year’s official reign, inscribing on it his own name and his father’s, his place of birth and year of office. Hence some of the mysterious imagery of this verse, applied to Christians as priests of God in the next world. This is more probable than to suspect an allusion to what was written on the high priest’s forehead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm" title="And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave on it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.">Exodus 28:36</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-5.htm" title="And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.">Revelation 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>). Pillars were also, of course, sculptured now and then in human shape. For the first (<span class="ital">a</span>) of the three names, <span class="ital">cf. Baba Bathra</span>, 75, 2: R. Samuel ait R. Jochanan dixisse tres appellari nomine Dei, justos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-7.htm" title="Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yes, I have made him.">Isaiah 43:7</a>), Messiam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>), Hierosolyma (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm" title="It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.">Ezekiel 48:35</a>); also Targ. Jerus. on Exod. xxviii. 30, quisquis memorat illud nomen sanctum [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, <span class="greekheb">τετραγράμματον</span>] in hora necessitatis, eripitur, et occulta reteguntur. Where a name was equivalent in one sense to personality and character, to have a divine name conferred on one or revealed to one was equivalent to being endowed with divine power. The divine “hidden name” (<span class="ital">Asc. Isa.</span> i. 7 Jewish: “as the Lord liveth whose name has not been sent into this world,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-7.htm" title="The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast on the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.">Revelation 8:7</a>) was (according to En. lxix. 14f.) known to Michael, and had talismanic power over dæmons. Perhaps an allusion to this also underlies the apocalyptic promise, the talismanic metaphor implying that God grants to the victorious Christian inviolable safety against evil spirits (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,...">Romans 8:38-39</a>). The second (<span class="ital">b</span>) name denotes (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-5.htm" title="Even to them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.">Isaiah 56:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm" title="It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.">Ezekiel 48:35</a>) that the bearer belongs not merely to God but to the heavenly city and society of God. Since rabbinic speculation was sure that Abraham had the privilege of knowing the mysterious new name for Jerusalem in the next world, John claims this for the average and honest Christian. On the connexion between the divine name and the temple, see 3Ma 2:9; 3Ma 2:14, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/9-8.htm" title="Throw down their strength in thy power, and bring down their force in thy wrath: for they have purposed to defile thy sanctuary, and to pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious name resteth and to cast down with sword the horn of thy altar.">Jdt 9:8</a>, etc. The third (<span class="ital">c</span>) “my own new name” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>) is reflected in <span class="ital">Asc. Isa.</span> ix. 5 (the Son of God, <span class="ital">et nomen eius non potes audire donec de carne exibis</span>); it denotes some esoteric, incommunicable, pre-existent (LXX of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-17.htm" title="O God, you have taught me from my youth: and till now have I declared your wondrous works.">Psalm 71:17</a>, En. lxix. 26, <span class="ital">cf. R. J.</span> 249, 344) title, the knowledge of which meant power to invoke and obtain help from its bearer. The whole imagery (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>) is drawn from the primitive superstition that God’s name. like a man’s name, must be kept secret, lest if known it might be used to the disadvantage of the bearer (Frazer’s <span class="ital">Golden Bough</span>, 2nd ed. i. 443 f.). The close tie between the name and the personality in ancient life lent the former a secret virtue. Especially in Egyptian and in Roman belief, to learn a god’s name meant to share his power, and often “the art of the magician consisted in obtaining from the gods a revelation of their sacred names”. The point made by the prophet here is that the Christian God bestows freely upon his people the privilege of invoking his aid successfully, and of entering into his secret nature; also, perhaps, of security in the mysterious future across death. See the famous ch. 125. of <span class="ital">E. B. D.</span> where the successive doors will not allow Nu to pass till he tells them their names (<span class="ital">cf.</span> chapters cxli. f.). Ignatius tells the Philadelphians (obviously referring to this passage, <span class="ital">ad Phil.</span> 6) that people unsound upon the truth of Jesus Christ are to him <span class="greekheb">στῆλαι καὶ τάφοι νεκρῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ οἶς γέγραπται μόνον ὀνόματα ἀνθρώπων</span>. The <span class="greekheb">μόνον</span> is emphatic. In the survival of 2 Peter during the later conquests which left the other six towns of the Apocalypse more or less ruined, Gibbon (ch. 64.) irrelevantly finds “a pleasing example that the paths of honour and safety may sometimes be the same”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[905] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[906].

But here the promise is not for Apostles or their successors only, but for all the faithful: the point is not “he shall be one of the great and beautiful stones on which the others rest,” but “he shall be so placed that he cannot be removed while the whole fabric stands.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will write upon him</span>] We repeatedly have in this book the image of the divine Name written on the foreheads of God’s servants: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>. Hence the inscribing the name is here equally appropriate to the figure and the thing signified: probably the metaphor of the pillar is not dropped, but writing the name on the pillar means the same as writing it on the man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the name of my God, and the name of the city</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-5.htm" title="One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand to the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.">Isaiah 44:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm" title="In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name with which she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.">Jeremiah 33:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm" title="It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.">Ezekiel 48:35</a>, for the junction of these two names. The <span class="ital">three</span> names joined here are in a manner those of the Trinity, the Church being representative of the Spirit. It is probable that passages like this did much to suggest the use of the sign of the Cross on the forehead, both at Baptism and on other occasions that seemed to call for a profession of faith: and the image of the “new name” (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>) harmonises well with the much later usage of conferring a name in Baptism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which cometh down</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm" title="And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,">Revelation 21:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my new name</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a> there referred to.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/revelation/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm" title="Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write on him my new name.">Revelation 3:12</a>.

The "overcoming" is a present continuous process, but will have a termination, and then he who has faithfully fought the daily battle will be made <span class="accented">a pillar</span>, steadfast, immovable. St. John may be alluding to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the two pillars of Solomon's temple set up in the porch, and called <span class="accented">Jachin</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> he will establish) and <span class="accented">Boaz</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e5;</span>, in him is strength); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15, 21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>. Both names signify steadfastness and permanence, and would serve to render emphatic the superiority in these respects of the reward to come when compared with the evanescent nature of present suffering. <span class="accented">A pillar is</span> constantly used as a figure of strength and durability (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A contrast may be intended between the immovableness of the Christian's future position and the liability of pillars in the Philadelphian temples to succumb to the effects of the frequent earthquakes which took place there (see on ver. 7). Such pillars, moreover, were frequently sculptured in human shape. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Matthew Henry suggests that a reference <span class="accented">may</span> be intended to monumental pillars bearing inscriptions; the signification being "a monumental pillar of the free and powerful grace of God, never to be defaced or removed; not a support - heaven needing no such props." But it <span class="accented">seems</span> much more likely that St. John is alluding to the Hebrew temple. In the temple. The <span class="accented">temple</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, the shrine, the dwelling place of God, not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, the whole extent of the sacred buildings. The latter word occurs often in St. John's Gospel, but never in the Apocalypse. The <span class="accented">temple</span> in the Revelation is the abode of God, the sacred shrine into which all may be privileged to enter, both in this world and in the world to come. Of my God (see note on Revelation 3:2; 2:7). And he shall go no more out. "And out of it he shall in no wise go out more:" such is the full force of the Greek. The conqueror's period of probation will be over, and he shall be for ever free from the possibility of falling away. Trench quotes St. Augustine: "Quis non desideret illam civi-tatem, unde amicus non exit, quo inimicus non intrat?" And I will write upon him the name of my God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>, "His name shall be in their foreheads;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>, "Those which have not the seal of God in their foreheads;" the former passage referring to the elect in heaven, the latter distinguishing Christians on earth from their heathen oppressors). In the passage under consideration the action is future; it does not refer to holy baptism, but to the sealing of the faithful upon their entrance into glory - a sealing which shall settle for ever, and make all things sure. "To write the name upon" anything is a common figurative expression in Hebrew to denote taking absolute possession of, and making completely one's own. Thus Joab fears that Rabbah may be called after his name, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> looked upon as his, if David should be absent at the capture of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-28.htm">2 Samuel 12:28</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-27.htm">Numbers 6:27</a>). The struggling Christian is encouraged by hearing that a time will come when he will without any doubt become God's own, incapable of being removed or claimed by other. In the rabbinical book, 'Bava Bathra,' 75. 2, it is noted that there are three applications of the name of God: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the just (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A reference may be intended to the frontlet of the high priest, upon which was inscribed, "Holiness to the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). The inscription is threefold: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the name of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the name of the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the name of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For God was the Christian maintaining his warfare; to the Church, the new Jerusalem, was he rendering this service; under Christ, as Captain, was the fight being accomplished. Again, the victorious Christian was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to belong completely to God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to possess the citizenship of the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to enter into the glory of Christ, which was the new name, that which he knew not yet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We can here trace an analogy to the baptismal formula. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The name of God the Father, whose we are made; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> God the Holy Ghost, whose indwelling guides and sustains his Church, the new Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> God the Son, by whose Name we shall enter glory. <span class="cmt_word">And the name of the city of my God</span>, which is <span class="cmt_word">new Jerusalem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the city</span>...  <span class="accented">new Jerusalem</span> (see Revised Version). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a> the name given to the city Jerusalem is Jehovah Shammah, "the Lord is there;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> Jehovah Tsidkenu, "the Lord our Righteousness." Either of these <span class="accented">may</span> be meant; but, as Alford points out, the holy name itself has already been inscribed. In any case, the victorious one is to be openly acknowledged a citizen of the new Jerusalem. The old Jerusalem was destroyed, and her citizens scattered; but a new Jerusalem, of which the true Israelites are the citizens, should reunite the faithful. It is noticeable that without exception, throughout the Revelation, St. John uses the Hebraic form of the name <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;</span>, while in the Gospel <span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> always occurs. He almost seems to distinguish thus between the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly - the home of the true Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Which cometh down out of heaven from my God</span>. "Which cometh down" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), a grammatical anomaly (cf. ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a> and Revelation 3:12). The name "new Jerusalem" is always coupled in the Revelation with the phrase, "coming down from heaven" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>). The spirituality and holiness of the Church is thus set forth, since its being is wholly due to God, in its creation and sustenance. <span class="cmt_word">And I</span> will write upon him <span class="cmt_word">my new name</span>; <span class="accented">and mine own new name</span> (Revised Version). This is not any of the names given in the Revelation, but that referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which no one knew except himself. The passage is a promise that when Christ makes us completely his own by writing his own new name on us, he will admit us into his full glory, which is at present incomprehensible to us. Such comprehension is one of the things <span class="accented">"which</span> shall be hereafter" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a>), and which cannot now be known to us, <span class="accented">"for</span> now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Pillar (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The word occurs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1</a>. The reference here is not to any prominence in the earthly church, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>, but to blessedness in the future state. The exact meaning is doubtful. Some explain, he shall have a fixed and important place in the glorified church. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>. Others emphasize the idea of stability, and find a possible local reference to the frequent earthquakes from which Philadelphia had suffered, and which had shaken its temples. Strabo says: "And Philadelphia has not even its walls unimpaired, but daily they are shaken in some way, and gaps are made in them. But the inhabitants continue to occupy the land notwithstanding their sufferings, and to build new houses." Others again emphasize the idea of beauty. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>, where the saints are described living stones.<p>Temple (&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-5.htm">Matthew 4:5</a>.<p>Upon him<p>The conqueror, not the pillar.

Probably with reference to the golden plate inscribed with the name of Jehovah, and worn by the High-Priest upon his forehead (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>). See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>.<p>New Jerusalem<p>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>. The believer whose brow is adorned with this name has the freedom of the heavenly city. Even on earth his commonwealth is in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>). "Still, his citizenship was latent: he was one of God's hidden ones; but now he is openly avouched, and has a right to enter in by the gates to the city" (Trench). The city is called by John, the great and holy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>); by Matthew, the holy city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-5.htm">Matthew 4:5</a>); by Paul, Jerusalem which is above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>); by the writer to the Hebrews, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>). Plato calls his ideal city Callipolis, the fair city ("Republic," vii., 527), and the name Ouranopolis, heavenly city, was applied to Rome and Byzantium. For new (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;), see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>. The new Jerusalem is not a city freshly built (&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;), but is new (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;) in contrast with the old, outworn, sinful city. In the Gospel John habitually uses the Greek and civil form of the name, &#x399;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;; in Revelation, the Hebrew and more holy appellation, &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;. </body></html>
