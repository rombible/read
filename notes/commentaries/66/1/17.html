Was this He in whose bosom He had lain at that Last Supper, and said, ‘Lord, which is he that betrayeth Thee?’ When I saw Him thus transformed, thus glorified, I fell at His feet as one dead. Well might such be the effect, even upon the spirit of a just man made perfect—and St. John was still in the body—of such an open revelation of the risen glory of Christ” (Dr. Vaughan). It was pity, and the pang felt at the severity of retribution which overtook sin, which made Dante fall as a dead body falls (<span class= "ital">Inferno,</span> v.); it is the felt consciousness of unworthiness which seems to have overcome the Evangelist. This consciousness has its witness outside the Bible as well as in it. “Semele must perish if Jupiter reveals himself to her in his glory, being consumed in the brightness of that glory.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>, “Thou canst not see My face; for there shall no man see Me and live.”) For every man it is a dreadful thing to stand face to face with God. Yet the consciousness of this unworthiness to behold God, or to receive a near revelation of His presence, is a sign of faith, and is welcomed as such. Of him who said, “Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof,” Christ said, “I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-8.htm" title="The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.">Matthew 8:8-10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not.</span>—The words “unto me” should be omitted. The gesture is designed to give the assurance of comfort; the hand which was raised up to bless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.">Luke 24:51</a>), which was reached forth to heal the leper, to raise the sinking Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-31.htm" title="And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?">Matthew 14:31</a>), and to touch the wounded ear of Malchus, is now stretched out to reassure His servant; and the words, like those which John had heard upon the Mount of Transfiguration, and when toiling against the waves of Galilee, bid him not to be afraid. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-10.htm" title="And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.">Daniel 10:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I am the first and the last</span>.—The “last” must not be taken here to mean the least and lowest, as though it referred to our Lord’s humiliation; the last points forwards, as the <span class= "ital">first</span> points backwards. He was before all things, and so the <span class= "ital">first;</span> and though all things change, folded up as a vesture, yet His years shall not fail, and so He is the <span class= "ital">last. “</span>The <span class= "ital">first</span> because all things are from Me; the last because to Me are all things” (Richard of St. Victor). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-11.htm" title="They shall perish; but you remain; and they all shall wax old as does a garment;">Hebrews 1:11-12</a>.) This pre-eminence of first and last is thrice claimed for the Lord Jehovah in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm" title="Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.">Isaiah 41:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm" title="Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.">Isaiah 48:12</a>), and thrice for the Lord Jesus in this book (in this passage, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-8.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things said the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;">Revelation 2:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.">Revelation 22:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:...">Revelation 1:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when I saw him </span>— In this awful, this glorious, and resplendent form, I was perfectly overwhelmed with the majesty of his appearance, so that <span class="ital">I fell at his feet as dead </span>— Human nature not being able to sustain so glorious an appearance. Thus was he prepared, (like Daniel of old, whom he particularly resembles,) for receiving so weighty a prophecy. A great sinking of nature usually precedes a large communication of heavenly things. St. John, before our Lord suffered, was so intimate with him as to lean on his breast, to lie in his bosom. Yet now, near seventy years after, the aged apostle is by one glance struck to the ground. What a glory must this be! Ye sinners, be afraid. Cleanse your hands. Purify your hearts. Ye saints, be humble. Prepare. Rejoice. But rejoice unto him with reverence. An increase of reverence toward this awful Majesty can be no prejudice to your faith. Let all petulancy, with all vain curiosity, be far away, while you are thinking or reading of these things. <span class="ital">And he laid his right hand upon me </span>— The same wherein he held the seven stars. What did St. John then feel in himself? <span class="ital">Saying, Fear not — </span>His look terrifies, his speech strengthens. He does not call John by name, (as the angel did Zachariah and others,) but spoke as his well-known Master. What follows is also spoken to strengthen and encourage him. <span class="ital">I am </span>— When in his state of humiliation he spoke of his glory, he frequently spoke in the third person, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>, but he now speaks of his own glory without any veil, in plain and direct terms. <span class="ital">The first and the last</span> — That is, the eternal God, who is from everlasting to everlasting, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm" title="Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.">Isaiah 41:4</a>. <span class="ital">I am he that liveth </span>— Another peculiar title of God; and I <span class="ital">have the keys of death and of hell </span>— Or <span class="ital">hades, </span>that is, the invisible world; in the intermediate state the body abides in death, the soul in hades. Christ hath the keys of, that is, the power over both, killing or quickening of the body, and disposing of the soul as it pleaseth him. He gave St. Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven, but not the keys of <span class="ital">death </span>or of <span class="ital">hades. </span>How comes then his supposed successor at Rome by the keys of purgatory? It must be allowed that <span class="greekheb">αδης </span><span class="ital">hades, </span>sometimes signifies <span class="ital">the grave; </span>but, as Mr. Howe has largely proved in his excellent discourse on this text, the interpretation here given is most reasonable. That which would refer it to <span class="ital">hell, </span>as the seat of the damned, limits the sense in a manner very derogatory from the honour of our Lord, as he there shows unanswerably. According to Grotius, (in his note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>,) the word <span class="greekheb">αδης </span>always denotes either death, or the state after death. Our English, or rather Saxon word, <span class="ital">hell, </span>in its original signification, (though it is now understood in a more limited sense,) exactly answers to the Greek word <span class="greekheb">αδης</span>, and denotes a <span class="ital">concealed </span>or <span class="ital">unseen </span>place, and this sense of the word is still retained in the eastern, and especially in the western counties of England; for to <span class="ital">hele </span>over a thing, is to <span class="ital">cover </span>it. From the preceding description mostly are taken the titles given to Christ in the following letters, particularly the first four.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-19.htm" title="Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;...">Revelation 1:19-20</a>, </span><span class="ital">Write the things which thou hast seen </span>— Contained in this chapter, which accordingly are written, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-11.htm" title="Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea....">Revelation 1:11-18</a> : <span class="ital">and the things which are </span>— The instructions relating to the present state of the seven churches; these are written <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-1.htm" title="To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things said he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks;...">Revelation 2:1-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead....">Revelation 3:1-22</a>; <span class="ital">and which</span> <span class="ital">shall be hereafter — </span>The future events which begin to be exhibited in the fourth chapter, where (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>) it is said, <span class="ital">Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter, </span>namely, to the end of the world. <span class="ital">The mystery </span>— The mysterious meaning; <span class="ital">of the seven stars </span>— St. John knew better than we do, in how many respects these stars were a proper emblem of those angels; how nearly they resembled each other, and how far they differed in magnitude, brightness, and other circumstances. <span class="ital">The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches </span>— Mentioned in the eleventh verse. In each church there was one pastor or ruling minister, to whom all the rest were subordinate. This pastor, bishop, or overseer, had the peculiar care over that flock: on him the prosperity of that congregation in a great measure depended; and he was to answer for all those souls at the judgment-seat of Christ. <span class="ital">And the seven candlesticks are seven churches </span>— How significant an emblem is this! For a candlestick, though of gold, has no light of itself; neither has any church, or child of man. But they receive from Christ the light of truth, holiness, comfort, that it may shine to all around them. As soon as this was spoken, St. John wrote it down, even all that is contained in this first chapter. Afterward, what was contained in the second and third chapters, was dictated to him in like manner. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The churches receive their light from Christ and the gospel, and hold it forth to others. They are golden candlesticks; they should be precious and pure; not only the ministers, but the members of the churches; their light should so shine before men, as to engage others to give glory to God. And the apostle saw as though of the Lord Jesus Christ appeared in the midst of the golden candlesticks. He is with his churches always, to the end of the world, filling them with light, and life, and love. He was clothed with a robe down to the feet, perhaps representing his righteousness and priesthood, as Mediator. This vest was girt with a golden girdle, which may denote how precious are his love and affection for his people. His head and hairs white like wool and as snow, may signify his majesty, purity, and eternity. His eyes as a flame of fire, may represent his knowledge of the secrets of all hearts, and of the most distant events. His feet like fine brass burning in a furnace, may denote the firmness of his appointments, and the excellence of his proceedings. His voice as the sound of many waters, may represent the power of his word, to remove or to destroy. The seven stars were emblems of the ministers of the seven churches to which the apostle was ordered to write, and whom Christ upheld and directed. The sword represented his justice, and his word, piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, Heb 4:12. His countenance was like the sun, when it shines clearly and powerfully; its strength too bright and dazzling for mortal eyes to behold. The apostle was overpowered with the greatness of the lustre and glory in which Christ appeared. We may well be contented to walk by faith, while here upon earth. The Lord Jesus spake words of comfort; Fear not. Words of instruction; telling who thus appeared. And his Divine nature; the First and the Last. His former sufferings; I was dead: the very same whom his disciples saw upon the cross. His resurrection and life; I have conquered death, and am partaker of endless life. His office and authority; sovereign dominion in and over the invisible world, as the Judge of all, from whose sentence there is no appeal. Let us listen to the voice of Christ, and receive the tokens of his love, for what can he withhold from those for whose sins he has died? May we then obey his word, and give up ourselves wholly to him who directs all things aright.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead - As if I were dead; deprived of sense and consciousness. He was overwhelmed with the suddenness of the vision; he saw that this was a divine being; but he did not as yet know that it was the Saviour. It is not probable that in this vision he would immediately recognize any of the familiar features of the Lord Jesus as he had been accustomed to see him some sixty years before; and if he did, the effect would have been quite as overpowering as is here described. But the subsequent revelations of this divine personage would rather seem to imply that John did not at once recognize him as the Lord Jesus. The effect here described is one that often occurred to those who had a vision of God. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>, "Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>, "And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business."

Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>, "He touched me and set me upright." We usually stretch out the right hand to raise up one who has fallen.<p>Saying unto me, Fear not - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-27.htm">Matthew 14:27</a>, "It is I; be not afraid." The fact that it was the Saviour, though he appeared in this form of overpowering majesty, was a reason why John should not be afraid. Why that was a reason, he immediately adds - that he was the first and the last; that though he had been dead he was now alive, and would continue ever to live, and that he had the keys of hell and of death. It is evident that John was overpowered with that awful emotion which the human mind must feel at the evidence of the presence of God. Thus, people feel when God seems to come near them by the impressive symbols of his majesty - as in the thunder, the earthquake, and the tempest. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-34.htm">Luke 9:34</a>. Yet, amidst the most awful manifestations of divine power, the simple assurance that our Redeemer is near us is enough to allay our fears, and diffuse calmness through the soul.<p>I am the first and the last - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>. This is stated to be one of the reasons why he should not fear - that he was eternal: "I always live - have lived through all the past, and will live through all which is to come - and therefore I can accomplish all my promises, and execute all my purposes." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

The glorious person here described, who was just behind him, and of whom he had a full view, being so near him: <p>I fell at his feet as dead; through consternation and fear, the sight was so amazing and terrible; the appearance of a divine person in any degree of majesty and glory, has had some considerable effect upon men, even upon the best of men; but John seems to be more affected with it than any, as the vision was the more grand and illustrious: Manoah was afraid he should die, but did not fall down as dead; Ezekiel fell upon his face, but had his senses; Daniel's comeliness turned into corruption, and he retained no strength, he fainted, and fell into a deep sleep; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>; but John fell down at once, as dead. This panic which good men were seized with, at any more than ordinary appearance of God, or apprehension of his presence, arose from a notion that present death ensues a sight of him; hence Jacob wonders, and is thankful, that he had seen God face to face, and yet his life was preserved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; and such an effect as here, upon the body, any uncommon discovery of the divine Being has, partly through the weakness of human nature, which in its present circumstances is not able to bear the rays and glories of a divine person; hence the resurrection of the body in power, glory, and immortality, incorruption and spirituality, is necessary to the enjoyment of God and Christ in a state of bliss and happiness to all eternity; and partly through a consciousness of sin, which ever since the fall of Adam has occasioned fear and perturbation of mind, even in the best of saints, when they have had any sense of the divine Majesty being near, in an unusual form of glory: <p>and he laid his right hand upon me; even the same in which he had, and held the seven stars; and which showed what an affection he had for him, in what esteem he had him, what care he took of him, and what power he would exert in lifting up, strengthening, and supporting him; for he laid not his hand on him in wrath and angers, but in love; and in order to raise him up and revive his spirits, and remove his fears; hence the Ethiopic version renders it, "and he took hold on me with his right hand, and lifted me up"; as he does all who in a spiritual sense fall at his feet; it is always safe and comfortable falling there: <p>saying unto me, fear not; language which John had heard from him in the days of his flesh, and might therefore be chose now on purpose that he might the sooner know who he was and be comforted; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-27.htm">Matthew 14:27</a>. <p>I am the first and the last; a way of speaking used by God when he is about to comfort his people, and remove their fears; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>; and is used by Christ for the same purpose here; and so is a proof of his true and proper deity, and is expressive of his eternity, and also of his dignity and excellency: he is the first and last in divine predestination, in the covenant of grace, in creation, in the business of salvation, and in his church, by whom, and for whom, are all things in it; he is the head of the body, the Son over his own house, and the firstborn among many brethren; and so the Alexandrian copy read, here, "the firstborn and the last".

This reference of the conception <span class="greekheb">ὁ ζῶν</span>,[828] which is in itself already necessary, since the <span class="ital">personal</span> Eternal One must have his eternity as an energetic attribute, is yet specially emphasized by <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm" title="I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.">Revelation 1:18</a>; and that, too, in such way that what is said in both halves of the verse, even though not according to form, yet according to meaning, is related as foundation (<span class="greekheb">καὶ <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΕΝ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΑἹΏΝΩΝ</span></span></span>) and consequence (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἝΧΩ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>). For, just because Christ who suffered death,[829] after having risen,[830] henceforth does not die,[831] but is living to eternity,[832] he has the keys of death and of hell, i.e., power over them, so that he can preserve and deliver therefrom, but also can cast therein.[833] The figurative presentation of the <span class="ital">keys</span>[834] must not be regarded a personification of the <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span> and the <span class="greekheb">ᾅδης</span>;[835] but, on the other hand also, both can be regarded only as a place, when it is said that “both designate one and the same idea.”[836] Yet the <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span>, after which the <span class="greekheb">ᾅδης</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.

The gates of death[838] are spoken of in opposition to the gates of the <span class="ital">daughter</span> of Zion;[839] here death is personified, and regarded as a possessor or lord of the gates. The place of death, which appears closed in with gates, is <span class="greekheb">ᾅδης</span>.[840] In this double and not completely symmetrical delineation of the idea, according to which “gates” are ascribed to personal death as well as to local hell, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΛΕῖς</span></span></span> must here be understood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The intention of this entire detailed address is so far in advance of merely freeing John from his terrors of death, as John is the prophet, who himself must experience and understand the majesty of the Lord, whose coming he is to proclaim, in order that he may bring to the churches full testimony concerning the same.[841] Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-19.htm" title="Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;">Revelation 1:19</a> suitably concludes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[819] <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm" title="As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.

All the early Christian revelations which are self-contained, presuppose the risen Christ as their source; the Apocalypse of Peter, being fragmentary, is hardly an exception to the rule.

Richard of St. Victor comments thus: "I am the first and the last. First through creation, last through retribution.

First, because I am the cause of origin; last, because I am the judge and the end" (cited by Trench). </body></html>
