The exact meaning of this word (used only here) is not certain. The most trustworthy authors incline to take it as a hybrid word, half Greek, half Hebrew—<span class= "ital">chalcos, </span>brass, and <span class= "ital">labân, </span>white, to whiten—and understand it to signify brass which has attained in the furnace a white heat. “Such technical words were likely enough to be current in a population like that of Ephesus, consisting largely of workers in metal, some of whom—if we may judge from the case of Alexander the coppersmith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-34.htm" title="But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2Timothy 4:14</a>)—were, without doubt, Jews. I believe the word in question to have belonged to this technical vocabulary. It is at any rate used by St. John as familiar and intelligible to those for whom he wrote” (Prof. Plumptre in the <span class= "ital">Epistles to Seven Churches, in loco</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">His voice as the sound</span> (better, <span class= "ital">voice, </span>as the same word—<span class= "ital">phoné</span>—is used twice, and translated first “voice” and then “sound” in our English version) of many waters.—Daniel described the voice of the Ancient of Days as the voice of a multitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm" title="His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.">Daniel 10:6</a>); but the voice of the multitude was in earlier Hebrew writings compared to the sound of the waves of the sea, which the voice of the Lord alone could subdue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-7.htm" title="Which stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.">Psalm 65:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-4.htm" title="The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty waves of the sea.">Psalm 93:4</a>). This image the Evangelist adopts to describe the voice of Christ—strong and majestic, amid the Babel-sounds of earth. That voice, whose word stilled the sea, sounds as the waves of the sea, which St. John heard Him rebuke.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The churches receive their light from Christ and the gospel, and hold it forth to others. They are golden candlesticks; they should be precious and pure; not only the ministers, but the members of the churches; their light should so shine before men, as to engage others to give glory to God. And the apostle saw as though of the Lord Jesus Christ appeared in the midst of the golden candlesticks. He is with his churches always, to the end of the world, filling them with light, and life, and love. He was clothed with a robe down to the feet, perhaps representing his righteousness and priesthood, as Mediator. This vest was girt with a golden girdle, which may denote how precious are his love and affection for his people. His head and hairs white like wool and as snow, may signify his majesty, purity, and eternity. His eyes as a flame of fire, may represent his knowledge of the secrets of all hearts, and of the most distant events. His feet like fine brass burning in a furnace, may denote the firmness of his appointments, and the excellence of his proceedings. His voice as the sound of many waters, may represent the power of his word, to remove or to destroy. The seven stars were emblems of the ministers of the seven churches to which the apostle was ordered to write, and whom Christ upheld and directed. The sword represented his justice, and his word, piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, Heb 4:12. His countenance was like the sun, when it shines clearly and powerfully; its strength too bright and dazzling for mortal eyes to behold. The apostle was overpowered with the greatness of the lustre and glory in which Christ appeared. We may well be contented to walk by faith, while here upon earth. The Lord Jesus spake words of comfort; Fear not. Words of instruction; telling who thus appeared. And his Divine nature; the First and the Last. His former sufferings; I was dead: the very same whom his disciples saw upon the cross. His resurrection and life; I have conquered death, and am partaker of endless life. His office and authority; sovereign dominion in and over the invisible world, as the Judge of all, from whose sentence there is no appeal. Let us listen to the voice of Christ, and receive the tokens of his love, for what can he withhold from those for whose sins he has died? May we then obey his word, and give up ourselves wholly to him who directs all things aright.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And his feet like unto fine brass - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, "And his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass." See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>, "and they" (the feet of the living creatures) "sparkled like the color of burnished brass." The word used here -  &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  chalkolibano&#772; - occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>. It is not found in the Septuagint. The word properly means "white brass" (probably compounded of &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  chalkos, brass, and &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  libanos, whiteness, from the Hebrew &#1500;&#1489;&#1503;  laban, white). Others regard it as from &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  chalkos, brass, and &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;  liparon, clear. The metal referred to was undoubtedly a species of brass distinguished for its clearness or whiteness. Brass is a compound metal, composed of copper and zinc. The color varies much according to the different proportions of the various ingredients. The Vulgate here renders the word "aurichalcum," a mixture of gold and of brass - perhaps the same as the &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  e&#772;lektron - the electrum of the ancients, composed of gold and of silver, usually in the proportion of four parts gold and one part silver, and distinguished for its brilliancy. See Robinson, Lexicon, and Wetstein, in loco. The kind of metal here referred to, however, would seem to be some compound of brass - of a whitish and brilliant color. The exact proportion of the ingredients in the metal here referred to cannot now be determined.<p>As if they burned in a furnace - That is, his feet were so bright that they seemed to be like a beautiful metal glowing intensely in the midst of a furnace. Anyone who has looked upon the dazzling and almost insupportable brilliancy of metal in a furnace, can form an idea of the image here presented.<p>And his voice as the sound of many waters - As the roar of the ocean, or of a cataract. Nothing could be a more sublime description of majesty and authority than to compare the voice of a speaker with the roar of the ocean. This comparison often occurs in the Scriptures. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>, "And behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory."

Thus it answers to "burnished (flashing, or glowing) brass," Eze 1:7; Re 10:1, "His feet as pillars of fire." Translate, "Glowing brass, as if they had been made fiery (red-hot) in a furnace."

It may have been a local technical term in use among the metalworkers of Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm">2 Timothy 4:14</a>). The Rhemish Version renders it "latten." In what follows, the Revised Version is to be preferred: "as if <span class="accented">it had been refined</span> in a furnace; and his voice as the <span class="accented">voice</span> of many waters." It is tempting to think that "the roar of the sea is in the ears of the lonely man in Patmos;" but the image seems rather to be that of the sound of many cataracts (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>).

Some explain electrum, an alloy of gold and silver: others, brass of Lebanon (&#x391;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) others, brass of the color of frankincense (&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;): others again, that it is an hybrid compound of the Greek &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; brass, and the Hebrew laban to make white. Dean Plumptre observes: "Such technical words were likely enough to be current in a population like that of Ephesus, consisting largely of workers in metal, some of whom were no doubt Jews" ("Epistles to the Seven Churches of Asia").<p>Many waters<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>.
