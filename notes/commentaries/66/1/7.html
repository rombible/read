Even so, Amen.">Revelation 1:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold </span>— In this and the next verse are the proposition and the summary of the whole book. <span class="ital">He cometh </span>— Jesus Christ. Throughout this book, whenever it is said <span class="ital">He cometh, </span>it means his glorious coming. The preparation for this began at the destruction of Jerusalem, and more particularly at the time of writing this book, and goes on without any interruption, till that grand event is accomplished. Therefore it is never said in this book, <span class="ital">He will come, </span>but, <span class="ital">He cometh. </span>And yet it is not said, <span class="ital">He cometh again. </span>For when he came before, it was not like himself, but in <span class="ital">the form of a servant. </span>But his appearing in glory is, properly, his coming; namely, in a manner worthy of the Son of God. <span class="ital">And every eye </span>— Of the Jews in particular; <span class="ital">shall see him </span>— But with what different emotions, according as they had received or rejected him! <span class="ital">And they who </span>have <span class="ital">pierced him </span>— They, above all, who pierced his hands, or feet, or side. Thomas saw the prints of these wounds, even after his resurrection. And the same, undoubtedly, will be seen by all, when he cometh in the clouds of heaven; and they that condemned him shall be arraigned at his tribunal. <span class="ital">And all the tribes of the earth </span>— The word <span class="ital">tribes, </span>in the Revelation, generally means the <span class="ital">Israelites; </span>but where another word, such as <span class="ital">nations, </span>or <span class="ital">people, </span>is joined with it, it implies likewise, (as here,) all the rest of mankind. <span class="ital">Shall wail because of him </span>— For terror and pain, if they did not wail before by true repentance; even all who have rejected his government and opposed his interest, shall lament the fatal opposition, by which, instead of prevailing in the least against him, they have only effected their own destruction. In this verse is prefixed the great moral, which the whole book is designed to illustrate; namely, that though there should be great opposition made against the cause and kingdom of Christ, yet it should be utterly in vain, and his kingdom should triumph in the most illustrious manner, so that all who opposed it should have the greatest reason to mourn. And as this series of divine prophecy begins, so it ends with this sentiment, and with the joyful consent of his faithful servants to this glorious truth, which should fill the enemies of Christ with both terror and dismay. <span class="ital">Yea, amen </span>— This refers to, <span class="ital">every eye shall see him. </span>He that cometh saith, <span class="ital">Yea; </span>he that testifies it, <span class="ital">Amen. </span>The word translated <span class="ital">yea </span>is Greek, <span class="ital">amen </span>is Hebrew; for what is here spoken respects both Jew and Gentile. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:4-8 There can be no true peace, where there is not true grace; and where grace goeth before, peace will follow. This blessing is in the name of God, of the Holy Trinity, it is an act of adoration. The Father is first named; he is described as the Jehovah who is, and who was, and who is to come, eternal, unchangeable. The Holy Spirit is called the seven spirits, the perfect Spirit of God, in whom there is a diversity of gifts and operations. The Lord Jesus Christ was from eternity, a Witness to all the counsels of God. He is the First-born from the dead, who will by his own power raise up his people. He is the Prince of the kings of the earth; by him their counsels are overruled, and to him they are accountable. Sin leaves a stain of guilt and pollution upon the soul. Nothing can fetch out this stain but the blood of Christ; and Christ shed his own blood to satisfy Divine justice, and purchase pardon and purity for his people. Christ has made believers kings and priests to God and his Father. As such they overcome the world, mortify sin, govern their own spirits, resist Satan, prevail with God in prayer, and shall judge the world. He has made them priests, given them access to God, enabled them to offer spiritual and acceptable sacrifices, and for these favours they are bound to ascribe to him dominion and glory for ever. He will judge the world. Attention is called to that great day when all will see the wisdom and happiness of the friends of Christ, and the madness and misery of his enemies. Let us think frequently upon the second coming of Christ. He shall come, to the terror of those who wound and crucify him by apostacy: he shall come, to the astonishment of the whole world of the ungodly. He is the Beginning and the End; all things are from him and for him; he is the Almighty; the same eternal and unchanged One. And if we would be numbered with his saints in glory everlasting, we must now willing submit to him receive him, and honour him as a saviour, who we believe will come to be our Judge. Alas, that there should be many, who would wish never to die, and that there should not be a day of judgment!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold he cometh with clouds - That is, the Lord Jesus, when he returns, will come accompanied with clouds. This is in accordance with the uniform representation respecting the return of the Saviour. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-26.htm">Mark 13:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>. Clouds are appropriate symbols of majesty, and God is often represented as appearing in that manner. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>. So, among the pagan, it was common to represent their divinities as appearing clothed with a cloud:<p>"tandem venias, precamur,<p>Nube candentes humeros amictus.<p>Augur Apollo"<p>The design of introducing this representation of the Saviour, and of the manner in which he would appear, seems to be to impress the mind with a sense of the majesty and glory. of that being from whom John received his revelations. His rank, his character, his glory were such as to demand respect; all should reverence him, and all should feel that his communications about the future were important to them, for they must soon appear before him.<p>And every eye shall see him - He will be made visible in his glory to all that dwell upon the earth; to all the children of men. Everyone, therefore, has an interest in what he says; everyone has this in certain prospect, that he shall see the Son of God coming as a Judge.<p>And they also which pierced him - When he died; that is, they who pierced his hands, his feet, and his side. There is probably an allusion here to <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>; "They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn." The language here is so general that it may refer to any act of looking upon the pierced Saviour, and might be applied to those who would see him on the cross and to their compunctious visitings then; or to their subsequent reflections, as they might look by faith on him whom they had crucified; or to the feeling of any sinners who should reflect that their sins had been the cause of the death of the Lord Jesus; or it might be applied, as it is here, more specifically to the feelings which his murderers will have when they shall see him coming in his glory. All sinners who have pierced his heart by their crimes will then behold him and will mourn over their treatment of him; they, in a special manner, who imbrued their hands in his blood will then remember their crime and be overwhelmed with alarm. The design of what is here said seems to be, to show that the coming of the Saviour will be an event of great interest to all mankind. None can be indifferent to it, for all will see him. His friends will hail his advent (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>), but all who were engaged in putting him to death, and all who in any manner have pierced his heart by sin and ingratitude, unless they shall have repented, will have occasion of bitter lamentation when he shall come. There are none who have a more fearful doom to anticipate than the murderers of the Son of God, including those who actually put him to death, and those who would have engaged in such an act had they been present, and those who, by their conduct, have done all they could to pierce and wound him by their ingratitude.<p>And all kindreds of the earth - Greek, "All the tribes -  &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  phulai of the earth." This language is the same which the Saviour uses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>. See the notes on that passage. The word "tribes" is what is commonly applied to the twelve tribes of Israel, and thus used, it would describe the inhabitants of the Holy Land; but it may be used to denote nations and people in general, as descended from a common ancestor, and the connection requires that it should be understood in this sense here, since it is said that "every eye shall see him"; that is, all that dwell on the face of the earth.<p>Shall wail because of him - On account of him; on account of their treatment of him. The word rendered "wail" - &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  kopto&#772; - means properly to beat, to cut; then to beat or cut oneself in the breast as an expression of sorrow; and then to lament, to cry aloud in intense grief. The coming of the Saviour will be an occasion of this:<p>(a) because it will be an event which will call the sins of people to remembrance, and<p>(b) because they will be overwhelmed with the apprehension of the wrath to come.<p>Nothing would fill the earth with greater consternation than the coming of the Son of God in the clouds of heaven; nothing could produce so deep and universal alarm. This fact, which no one can doubt, is proof that people feel that they are guilty, since, if they were innocent, they would have nothing to dread by his appearing. It is also a proof that they believe in the doctrine of future punishment, since, if they do not, there is no reason why they should be alarmed at his coming. Surely people would not dread his appearing if they really believed that all will be saved. Who dreads the coming of a benefactor to bestow favors on him? Who dreads the appearing of a jailer to deliver him from prison; of a physician to raise him up from a bed of pain; of a deliverer to knock off the fetters of slavery? And how can it be that people should be alarmed at the coming of the Saviour, unless their consciences tell them that they have much to fear in the future? The presence of the Redeemer in the clouds of heaven would destroy all the hopes of those who believe in the doctrine of universal salvation - as the approach of death now often does. People believe that there is much to be dreaded in the future world, or they would not fear the coming of Him who shall wind up the affairs of the human race.<p>Even so, Amen - &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;  nai, ame&#772;n. "A double expression of "so be it, assuredly, certainly," one in Greek and the other in Hebrew" (Prof. Stuart). Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>, "Abba, Father" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#834;, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;  abba, ho pate&#772;r. The idea which John seems to intend to convey is, that the coming of the Lord Jesus, and the consequences which he says will follow, are events which are altogether certain. This is not the expression of a wish that it may be so, as our common translation would seem to imply, but a strong affirmation that it will be so. In some passages, how. over, the word (&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  nai) expresses assent to what is said, implying approbation of it as true, or as desirable. "Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>. So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-7.htm">Revelation 16:7</a>, "Even so (&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  nai), Lord God Almighty." So in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>, "Even so (&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  nai), come, Lord Jesus." The word "Amen" here seems to determine the meaning of the phrase, and to make it the affirmation of a "certainty," rather than the expression of a "wish." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. with clouds&#8212;Greek, "the clouds," namely, of heaven. "A cloud received Him out of their sight" at His ascension (Ac 1:9). His ascension corresponds to the manner of His coming again (Ac 1:11).

Secondarily, and here chiefly, at the general judgment all the ungodly, not only those who actually pierced Him, but those who did so by their sins, shall look with trembling upon Him. John is the only one of the Evangelists who records the piercing of Christ's side. This allusion identifies him as the author of the Apocalypse. The reality of Christ's humanity and His death is proved by His having been pierced; and the water and blood from His side were the antitype to the Levitical waters of cleansing and blood offerings.<p>all kindreds &#8230; shall wail&#8212;all the unconverted at the general judgment; and especially at His pre-millennial advent, the Antichristian confederacy (Zec 12:3-6, 9; 14:1-4; Mt 24:30).

John carries on the account of Christ in his kingly office, one branch of which is to execute judgment; and describes him by a future coming of his, which cannot be understood of his coming to take vengeance on the Jews, at the time of Jerusalem's destruction, though that is sometimes expressed in such language, and with such circumstances, as here; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; because if this revelation was made to John, in the latter end of Domitian's reign, as is commonly reported by the ancients, and in the year 95 or 96, as chronologers generally place it, it must be upwards of twenty years after the destruction of Jerusalem, and therefore cannot relate to that; nor to his coming in a spiritual sense to convert the Jews in the latter day; for this coming is personal, and with clouds, when he will be seen by every eye; all which circumstances do not so well agree with that; besides, all the kindreds of the earth will not lament on that account: the wicked will take little notice of it, the tribes of the Jews will rejoice at it, and so will all the converted Gentiles: it is better therefore to understand this of Christ's second coming to judge the quick and dead, which is represented as just at hand, to denote the certainty of it; and a "behold" is prefixed to it, to excite attention, and to denote the importance of it: things of great moment, and very surprising, will then be done; Christ will appear in great glory and majesty, the dead in Christ will be raised, Christ's personal kingdom will take place, and the general judgment come on. The manner of his coming will be "with clouds"; either figuratively, with angels, who will attend him both for grandeur and service, or literally, in the clouds of heaven; he shall descend in like manner as he ascended, and as Daniel prophesied he should, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. Hence, one of the names of the Messiah, with the Jews, is,  "Anani" (r), which signifies "clouds"; and his coming is so described, both to denote the grand and magnificent manner, in which he will come, making the clouds his chariots; and to strike terror into his enemies, clouds and darkness being about him, thunder and lightning breaking out of them, as tokens of that vengeance he comes to take upon them; as also the visibility of his coming, he shall descend from the third heaven, where he now is, into the airy heaven, and sit upon the clouds, as on his throne, and be visible to all: hence it follows, <p>and every eye shall see him; that is, everyone that has eyes shall see him, or all men shall see him; the righteous shall see him, and be glad; they shall see him in his glory, as he is, and for themselves, and be satisfied; they shall rejoice at the sight of him; they will be filled with joy unspeakable, and full of glory: but the wicked will see him and tremble; they will be filled with the utmost consternation and astonishment; they will not be able to bear the sight of him; they will flee from him, and call to the rocks and mountains to fall on them, and hide them from his face, <p>And they also which pierced him; his hands, feet, and side, when they crucified him; both the Roman soldiers, who actually did it, and the body of the Jewish nation, the rulers and common people, who consented to it, and at whose instigation it was done; these, being raised from the dead, shall see him with their bodily eyes, whom they so used, <p>And all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him; all the wicked, in the several parts of the world, will lament, and wring their hands, and express the inward terror and horror of their minds, at his appearing; they will fear his resentment of all their wicked words and actions; will dread his wrath, and tremble at his righteous judgment: <p>even so, Amen, says John, and so say all true believers; what the wicked lament, they rejoice at; they desire the coming of Christ, they love it, look and long for it; they believe it shall be, and wish it may be quickly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>; This expression of faith in, and desire after the coming of Christ, is signified by two words, the one Greek and the other Hebrew; suggesting, that this is an article of faith among all the saints of all nations, Jews and Gentiles, and is what they are wishing and waiting for, <p>(r) Targum in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3.htm">1 Chronicles 3</a>.24. vid.

He (Christ) cometh;[641] this is the theme of the Apoc.,[642] which is expressed here not in indefinite generality, but directly afterwards its chief points, as they are further unfolded in the book, are stated. For the coming of the <span class="ital">personal</span> Christ is a coming to <span class="ital">judgment</span>,[643] and indeed not only for hostile Jews (<span class="greekheb">οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν</span>), but also for the heathen (<span class="greekheb">καὶ κοψ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς</span>). Christ cometh “<span class="ital">with</span> the clouds.” The <span class="greekheb">μετά</span>[644] designates the coming one as <span class="ital">accompanied</span> by clouds; whether we are to regard these as beneath[645] or about him,[646] is not expressed. The <span class="greekheb">ἐρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν</span> does not form an apposition to “arising out of the sea,” and is not simply a descending from heaven,[647] for the conception, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>, is too unique to correspond to the stereotyped idea in our passage;[648] also, the <span class="greekheb">μετὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεφ</span>. is too significant for “down from heaven.” But, according to the O. T. mode of representation, God <span class="ital">coming to judgment</span> appears surrounded by clouds.[649] [See Note XXIII., p. 124.] When he comes, absolutely all (<span class="greekheb">πᾶς ὀφθαλμός</span>) will see him; not only his believers, who have remained steadfast to him, and whom he, their Judge, their Deliverer, will introduce into his glory,[650] but also—as is expressly declared by the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἽΤΙΝΕς</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Τῆς Γῆς</span></span></span>,—unbelievers. Among these, the first to be especially mentioned are <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΟἽΤΙΝΕς ΑὐΤΟΝ ἘΞΕΚΈΝΤΗΣΑΝ</span></span></span>, i.e., the Jews. Volkmar and Hilgenf.[651] incorrectly think here chiefly of the heathen, since heathen hands directed the plunge of the lance into the Crucified. [Note XXIV., p. 124.] But decisive against this is not only the relation to the subject, but also the expression, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΟΨ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Πᾶς ΑἹ ΦΥΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Γῆς</span></span></span>. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" title="And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.">John 19:37</a>, the prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>, forms the foundation, where the words <span class="greekheb">אֶת אַשֶר־דָּקָרוּ וְהִבִּיטוּ אֵלַי</span> are rendered by the LXX., <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΠΙΒΛΈΨΟΝΤΑΙ ΠΡῸς ΜῈ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΝΘʼ ὮΝ ΚΑΤΩΡΧΉΣΑΝΤΟ</span></span></span>. According to Zechariah, the converted people are to look towards their God, whom they had wounded by their infidelity and disobedience, i.e., as the LXX. correctly explain, had despised; but in this passage the “seeing,” i.e., the actual beholding of the coming Christ, is understood in the sense that then, at the commencement of the judgment, repentance is no longer possible, and only terror remains concerning sins that have then undoubtedly occurred. Against the pragmatism of this passage, Ebrard wishes here to find the meaning: “When he cometh, Israel shall be converted,[652] and the nations of the earth shall certainly lament,[653] as those who have fallen away.” Bengel falls into the same error, when he remarks of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΌΨΟΝΤΑΙ</span></span></span> in the second member, “Undoubtedly with hostile, or even, on the part of some, with <span class="ital">penitential</span>, terror.” How <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" title="And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.">John 19:37</a> is in this respect related to this passage, is not manifest; since there only the fact of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξεκέντησαν</span>, i.e., the thrust of the lance, is stated. The difference between <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" title="And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.">John 19:37</a> and this lies in the fact that there (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ὋΝ ἘΞΕΚΈΝΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>) the special point of the thrust of the lance is emphasized; while here (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤῸΝ ἘΞΕΚΈΝΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>) the subject is the death—“the slaying”[654]—in general, as the most manifest proof of hostile unbelief. As to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΚΕΝΤΕῖΝ</span></span></span> in this sense, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-29.htm" title="And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill you.">Numbers 22:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-54.htm" title="Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw your sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.">Jdg 9:54</a>, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/12-6.htm" title="And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came against those murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by night, and set the boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew.">2Ma 12:6</a>. Partly because of this difference, and also partly because Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion translate the word <span class="greekheb">דקר</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>, by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΚΕΝΤΕῖΝ</span></span></span>,[655] we dare not infer the identity of the Evangelist and the writer of the Apoc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ κόψονται ἐπʼ αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς</span>. Although this expression may comprise also the Jews, yet, according to the connection, it is to be limited to the anti-theocratic and antichristian heathen. The <span class="greekheb">κόψονται</span>[656] obtains, by the construction with <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span> and the acc.,[657] a graphic clearness, such as is peculiar to the entire style of the writer of the Apoc., by representing the mourning, not according to its inner reason (<span class="greekheb">ἐπʼ αὐτῷ</span>), but according to its external direction,—towards the coming Judge.[658]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Not only by the twofold assurance in both Greek and Hebrew,[659] at the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.

But while the <span class="ital">words</span> here are taken from Zechariah, the <span class="ital">thought</span> is rather that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a> : “they which pierced Him” are thought of, not as looking to Him by faith, and mourning for Him in penitence, but as seeing Him Whom they had not believed in, and mourning in despair.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all kindreds of the earth</span>] Better, <span class="bld">all the tribes</span>—the reference is still to Zech. l. c., through the medium of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm" title="And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.">Matthew 24:30</a>. Thus we see that the fact that the profitable and the unprofitable “mourning” (or “wailing”—the Greek word is the same in St Matthew as here) are foretold in the same terms, in solemnly suggestive contrast with each other, is due not to the Apostle but to his Master: it is He that tells us that all tribes of the earth <span class="ital">must</span> mourn, either now for the woe our sins caused Him, or then for the woe they will cause us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because of him</span>] Literally, “at him;” at sight of Him. R. V. “over Him,” which can hardly be meant here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Even so, Amen</span>] Or, <span class="bld">Yea, Amen</span>—the two words, Greek and Hebrew, being similarly coupled in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>. The second, like the first, is an emphatic word of <span class="ital">confirmation</span>—so used e.g. repeatedly by our Lord Himself, St <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm" title="For truly I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one stroke or one pronunciation mark shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.">Matthew 5:18</a>, &c., where it is translated “verily.” The popular tradition that “Amen” means “So be it” is only partially true: even in its liturgical use, we append it to creeds as well as prayers. It comes from the same Hebrew root as the words for “faith” and “truth;” the primary meaning being apparently “solidity.” See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/revelation/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.

It seems best to make ver. 7 a kind of appendix to the salutation, and ver. 8 a kind of prelude to the whole book. They each give us one of the fundamental thoughts of the Apocalypse; ver. 7, Christ's certain return to judgment; ver. 8, his perfect Divinity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh</span>. He who loveth us and cleansed us and made us to be a kingdom will assuredly come. While interpreting the verse of the second advent, we need not exclude the coming to "those who pierced him" in the destruction of Jerusalem, and to "the tribes of the earth" in the breakup of the Roman empire. <span class="cmt_word">With the clouds.</span> This probably refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>, "Ye shall see the Son of man ... coming with the clouds of heaven" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, "Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven"). Aquinas and other writers make the clouds symbolize the saints, "who rain by preaching, glisten by working miracles, are lifted up by refusing earthly things, fly by lofty contemplation." <span class="cmt_word">And they</span> also; better, <span class="accented">and all they who</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">pierced him.</span> This is strong evidence of common authorship between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> St. John alone mentions the piercing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a> the writer, in quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, deserts the LXX. and follows the Masoretic Hebrew text. The LXX. softens down "pierced" into "insulted" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), "piercing" appearing a violent expression to use respecting men's treatment of Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a> the writer, in translating from the Hebrew, uses the uncommon Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>. The reference here is to all those who "crucify the Son of God afresh," not merely to the Jews. In what follows the Revised Version is to be preferred: "and all <span class="accented">the tribes</span> of the earth shall <span class="accented">mourn over</span> him? The wording is similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. The mourning is that of beating the breast, not wailing, and it is "over <span class="accented">him"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1fbf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Even so, Amen</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, like "Abba, Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-36.htm">Mark 4:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>), combines a Hebrew word with its Greek equivalent (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He cometh with clouds (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The clouds are frequently used in the descriptions of the Lord's second coming.

Compare the manifestation of God in the clouds at Sinai, in the cloudy pillar, the Shekinah, at the transfiguration, and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>.<p>Shall see (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>The verb denotes the physical act, but emphasizes the mental discernment accompanying it, and points to the result rather than to the act of vision. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>.

The expression here refers not to the Jews only, but to all who reject the Son of Man; those who "in any age have identified themselves with the Spirit of the Savior's murderers" (Milligan). The passage is justly cited as a strong evidence that the author of the Gospel is also the author of Revelation.<p>Kindreds (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>More correctly, tribes.

As the tribes of Israel are the figure by which the people of God, Jew or Gentile, are represented, so unbelievers are here represented as tribes, "the mocking counterpart of the true Israel of God."
