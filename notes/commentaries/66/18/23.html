The apostles, who are honoured and daily worshipped at Rome in an idolatrous manner, will rejoice in her fall. The fall of Babylon was an act of God's justice. And because it was a final ruin, this enemy should never molest them any more; of this they were assured by a sign. Let us take warning from the things which brought others to destruction, and let us set our affections on things above, when we consider the changeable nature of earthly things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee - Another image of desolation, as if every light were put out, and there were total darkness.<p>And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee - The merry and cheerful voice of the marriage procession in the streets (notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-7</a>), or the cheerful, glad voice of the newly-married couple in their own dwelling (notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>).<p>For thy merchants were the great men of the earth - Those who dealt with thee were the rich, and among them were even nobles and princes; and now that they trade with thee no more there is occasion for lamentation and sorrow. The contrast is great between the time when distinguished foreigners crowded thy marts, and now, when none of any kind come to traffic with thee. The origin of this representation is probably the description of Tyre in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>.<p>For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived - This is stated as a reason for the ruin that had come upon her. It is a common representation of papal Rome that she has deceived or deluded the nations of the earth (see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>), and no representation ever made accords more with facts as they have occurred. The word "sorceries" here refers to the various arts the tricks impostures, and false pretences by which this has been done.

But a literal allusion is not to be excluded, in view of the antipathy felt by pious Jews and early Christians to magic and sorcery.
