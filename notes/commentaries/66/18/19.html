The casting of dust or earth on the head is a token of sorrow and humiliation; it bears relation to the sitting in the dust. The one upon whom the sorrow had fallen sat in the dust or ashes. The attitude expressed that he had been brought very low, even to the ground. The mourning friends who came round him cast dust on their heads to express that they shared his sorrow. Thus it is related of Job: Job sat in the ashes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm" title="And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat down among the ashes.">Job 2:8</a>); the friends who came to comfort him sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm" title="The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,">Revelation 18:12</a>). So in this place, Babylon has been brought low (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm" title="Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.">Isaiah 47:1</a>); the mourners, whose gains sink with her fall, throw dust upon their heads.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">Alas! alas! that great city . . .</span>—The lament is parallel with the laments of the kings and the merchants; the difference is the appropriate reference to the destruction of the shipping interests. <span class= "ital">Woe! woe!</span> (or, <span class= "ital">Alas! alas!</span>)<span class= "ital"> the great city, in which all who had their vessels on the sea grew rich out of her costliness.</span> By her “costliness” we are to understand her extravagances of living, and the splendour of her palaces which drew materials from all ports of the world. The lament ends with the repeated cry, “in one hour.” <span class= "ital">Because in one hour she was desolated.</span><p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:9-19 The mourners had shared Babylon's sensual pleasures, and gained by her wealth and trade. The kings of the earth, whom she flattered into idolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, while obedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for her indulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friends partook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to share her plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and that sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger of God, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and riches of the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeance harder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, when not only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles of commerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this been peculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But let prosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchable riches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mourn that riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all the fruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at any rate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodly will be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for the fire that cannot be quenched.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they cast dust on their heads - A common sign of lamentation and mourning among the Orientals.
