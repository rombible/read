It is not meant that literally all the blood shed by violence had been shed by Rome, or any other single city of which Babylon is type: all that is meant is that Babylon, the world city, is founded on those principles, the logical outcome of which is violence, bloodshed, and hostility to the highest right: those who die by her hands, few or many, are the evidence that the whole tendency of her power is against holiness and truth. In the earthly view, we are guilty of the acts we do: in the heavenly view, we are guilty of all that the spirit and sin of our conduct tends to do. The spirit of transgression is seen in one act as well as in many, and as it is the attitude of the spirit that God looks upon, so in a single act may be gathered up the transgression of the whole law. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-6.htm" title="And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.">Revelation 17:6</a>, and Note there; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">James 2:10</a>).

The apostles, who are honoured and daily worshipped at Rome in an idolatrous manner, will rejoice in her fall. The fall of Babylon was an act of God's justice. And because it was a final ruin, this enemy should never molest them any more; of this they were assured by a sign.

Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>. No one can doubt the propriety of this representation with respect to pagan and papal Rome.<p>In regard to the general meaning and application of this chapter the following remarks may be made:<p>(1) It refers to papal Rome, and is designed to describe the final overthrow of that formidable anti-Christian power. The whole course of the interpretation of the previous chapters demands such an application, and the chapter itself naturally suggests it.<p>(2) if it be asked why so much of this imagery is derived from the condition of a maritime power, or pertains to commerce, since both Babylon and Rome were at some distance from the sea, and neither could with propriety be regarded as seaport towns, it may be replied:<p>(a) that the main idea in the mind of John was that of a rich and magnificent city;<p>(b) that all the things enumerated were doubtless found, in fact, in both Babylon and Rome;<p>(c) that though not properly seaport towns, they were situated on rivers that opened into seas, and were therefore not unfavorably situated for commerce; and,<p>(d) that, in fact, they traded with all parts of the earth.<p>The leading idea is that of a great and luxurious city, and this is filled up and decorated with images of what is commonly found in large commercial towns. We are not, therefore, to look for a literal application of this, and it is not necessary to attempt to find all these things, in fact, in the city referred to. Much of the description may be for the mere sake of keeping, or ornament.<p>(3) if this refers to Rome, as is supposed, then, in accordance with the previous representations, it shows that the destruction of the papal power is to be complete and final. The image which John had in his eye as illustrating that was undoubtedly ancient Babylon as prophetically described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13-14</a>, and the destruction of the power here referred to is to be as complete as was the destruction described there. It would not be absolutely necessary in the fulfillment of this to suppose that Rome itself is to become a heap of ruins like Babylon, whatever may be true on that point, but that the papal power, as such, is to be so utterly destroyed that the ruins of desolate Babylon would properly represent it.<p>(4) if this interpretation is correct, then the Reformation was in entire accordance with what God would have his people do, and was demanded by solemn duty to him. Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>, his people are expressly commanded to "come out of her, that they might not be partakers of her sins, nor of her plagues." If it had been the design of the Reformers to perform a work that should be in all respects a fulfilling of the command of God, they could have done nothing that would have more literally met the divine requirement. Indeed, the church has never performed a duty more manifestly in accordance with the divine will, and more indispensable for its own purity, prosperity, and safety, than the act of separating entirely and forever from papal Rome.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Applied by Christ (Mt 23:35) to apostate Jerusalem, which proves that not merely the literal city Rome, and the Church of Rome (though the chief representative of the apostasy), but the WHOLE of the faithless Church of both the Old and New Testament is meant by Babylon the harlot; just as the whole Church (Old and New Testament) is meant by "the woman" (Re 12:1). As to literal city, Aringhus in Bengel says, Pagan Rome was the "general shambles" for slaying the sheep of Jesus. Fred. Seyler in Bengel calculates that papal Rome, between A.D. 1540 and 1580, slew more than nine hundred thousand Protestants. Three reasons for the harlot's downfall are given: (1) The worldly greatness of her merchants, which was due to unholy traffic in spiritual things. (2) Her sorceries, or juggling tricks, in which the false prophet that ministers to the beast in its last form shall exceed her; compare "sorcerers" (Re 21:8; 22:15), specially mentioned among those doomed to the lake of fire. (3) Her persecution of (Old Testament) "prophets" and (New Testament) "saints."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In the rubbish of Rome, when destroyed, will be found the blood of all those holy servants of God, whether ministers of the gospel, or professors of it, who ever since the year 606, when the pope came first to his power, have been put to death for the testimony of Christ, and a faithful adherence to the purity of doctrine by him delivered, the purity of worship by him prescribed and directed, or the purity of discipline by his direction set up. As it is storied, that upon the dissolution of abbeys, and monasteries, and nunneries here in England, there were found in holes of walls, and ponds, the skulls and bones of many infants, the supposed bastards of those fathers: so, though men cannot or will not see it now, yet when the papacy shall have its period, men shall understand, that no prophet nor righteous man hath violently been put to death for the truth out of Rome, that is, out of the jurisdiction and influence of Rome; but though it may be they have been no professed papists that have been the cause or instruments of their death, yet they have done it as influenced from that bloody city; and the principles have been perfectly popish and antichristian which madly hurried them on to such cruelties. It was one of Luthers reasons why he would have none put to death for heresy, (as they call it), because he would have this particular character reserved for that antichristian synagogue.—But ah, Lord Jesus! When shall these things be? Or who shall live when the wise providence of God shall effect them, to join with the whole church, both triumphant and militant, in the song which we have prophesied of upon this occasion in the next chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">It is not for</span> us <span class="ital">to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,....

The climax of her iniquities is couched in terms of the primitive Semitic idea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm" title="And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.">Genesis 4:10</a>) that exposed and discovered blood is a cry for vengeance [<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/8-3.htm" title="And that he would have compassion upon the city, sore defaced, and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear the blood that cried unto him,">2Ma 8:3</a> f.]; blood violently shed wails till it is appeased by the punishment of the murderers. By a natural hyperbole, Rome is held responsible for the murders, judicial and otherwise, of saints and prophets and the slain of Israel in general—substituted here for the “apostles” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm" title="Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.">Revelation 18:20</a>, probably to include the Jews killed in the recent war as well as pre-Christian martyrs like the Maccabees of whom Augustine finely says: <span class="ital">nondum quidem erat mortuus Christus, sed martyres eos fecit moriturus Christus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-11.htm" title="They shall perish; but you remain; and they all shall wax old as does a garment;">Hebrews 1:11</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1</a>). Rome here is the last and worst exponent of persecution. Her collapse is attributed to their blood drawing down God’s utter retribution. “My blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-35.htm" title="The violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood on the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.">Jeremiah 51:35</a>, imprecating successfully the divine revenge, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-36.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.">Jeremiah 51:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-49.htm" title="As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.">Jeremiah 51:49</a>). As Chrysostom called Psalms 109. a prophecy in the shape of a curse, this vehement, sensitive oracle against Rome’s insolence and cruelty may be termed a curse in the form of a prophecy. A similar idea underlay the view of certain pious people who, according to Josephus (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Eus. <span class="ital">H. E.</span> ii. 23. 20–21), considered the fall of Jerusalem a retribution for the foul murder of James the Just nearly ten years before.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The doom-song is followed by an outburst of celestial triumph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:...">Revelation 19:1-8</a>) in answer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm" title="Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.">Revelation 18:20</a>.

The stern, exultant anthem, which is morally superior to the delight voiced by En. xlvii. 4, forms an overture to the final movement of the Apocalypse, as well as (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads....">Revelation 14:1-5</a>) a relief to the sombre context. 8 <span class="ital">b</span> is a prosaic editorial gloss, probably due to the liturgical use of the book, and the last clause of 10 (<span class="greekheb">ἡ γὰρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">προφητείας</span>) might be the same (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm" title="The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>), as many editors think, were it not for the genuinely Johannine ring of the words. In any case it is an after-thought, probably (so Baljon, Barth, etc.) added by the author himself, in order to bring out here what is brought out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a> by the explicit mention of the prophets, since <span class="greekheb">ἐχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span> alone would mean Christians in general. The presence of 9b–10 here, however, is not motived as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things....">Revelation 22:8-9</a>, where it comes in naturally at the finalê of the revelations and after a distinct allusion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1</a>) to the revealing angel. Here the angel of the second <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span> (at least) has not been mentioned since <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel?

The passage is certainly Johannine, but probably misplaced (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-14.htm" title="And the fruits that your soul lusted after are departed from you, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from you, and you shall find them no more at all.">Revelation 18:14</a>, etc.). Can it have originally lain at the end of 17., where the hierophant angel is speaking (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-17.htm" title="For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.">Revelation 17:17</a>, <span class="ital">words of God</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

Such technical dislocations and derangements are common enough in primitive literature (<span class="ital">cf.</span> my <span class="ital">Historical New Testament</span>, pp. xxxix. 676, 690). The passage must have been shifted to its present site either by accident or more probably by a scribe who saw that the similar assurance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm" title="And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.

Otherwise 1–10 is a unity as it stands. The change of situation in 1–3, 4–10 does not prove any combination of sources; it is simply another of the inconsequences and transitions characteristic of the whole book. The marriage-idea of 7, 8 is a proleptic hint which is not developed till later (21), while the supper (9) is only mentioned to be dropped—unless the grim vision of 17–21 (for which <span class="ital">cf.</span> Gressmann’s <span class="ital">Ursprung d.

Here is concluded the pronouncement of the judgment of Babylon; which may be said to answer the prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; and which forms the conclusion of the revelation commencing at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
