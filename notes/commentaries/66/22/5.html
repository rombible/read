Twice is it said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-25.htm" title="And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.">Revelation 21:25</a>) that all darkness shall cease; the darkness in which the saints and sorrowing walked shall be dispelled, when God gives them light. No artificial light is needed, since He who is Light is their light. Those who were children of light now dwell in the light of God’s countenance; and they reign who were made kings and priests to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>). With this utterance the visions of the Apocalypse close. The saints of God have been seen in the bitterness and toilfulness of their struggle and pilgrimage towards the Holy City; but from point to point they have made progress. They have gone from strength to strength, unto the God of gods appeareth every one of them in Zion. The Lord God is their sun and shield. He has given grace; He now gives glory. No good thing has been withheld; light, life, and love are theirs. “O Lord God of Hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/84-11.htm" title="For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.">Psalm 84:11-12</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 All streams of earthly comfort are muddy; but these are clear, and refreshing. They give life, and preserve life, to those who drink of them, and thus they will flow for evermore. These point to the quickening and sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to sinners through Christ. The Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, applies this salvation to our souls by his new-creating love and power. The trees of life are fed by the pure waters of the river that comes from the throne of God. The presence of God in heaven, is the health and happiness of the saints. This tree was an emblem of Christ, and of all the blessings of his salvation; and the leaves for the healing of the nations, mean that his favour and presence supply all good to the inhabitants of that blessed world. The devil has no power there; he cannot draw the saints from serving God, nor can he disturb them in the service of God. God and the Lamb are here spoken of as one. Service there shall be not only freedom, but honour and dominion. There will be no night; no affliction or dejection, no pause in service or enjoyment: no diversions or pleasures or man's inventing will there be wanted. How different all this from gross and merely human views of heavenly happiness, even those which refer to pleasures of the mind!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there shall be no night there - notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25</a>.<p>And they need no candle - No lamp; no artificial light, as in a world where there is night and darkness.<p>Neither light of the sun; for the Lord God, ... - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>.<p>And they shall reign forever and ever - That is, with God; they shall be as kings.

It seems to be proper, therefore, to pause on it for a moment, and to state in a summary manner what will be the principal features of that blessedness. All can see that, as a description, it occupies an appropriate place, not only in regard to this book, but to the volume of revealed truth. In reference to this particular book, it is the appropriate close of the account of the conflicts, the trials, and the persecutions of the church; in reference to the whole volume of revealed truth, it is appropriate because it occurs in the last of the inspired books that was written. It was proper that a volume of revealed truth given to mankind, and designed to describe a great work of redeeming mercy, should close with a description of the state of the righteous after death.<p>The principal features in the description are the following:<p>(1) There will be a new heaven and a new earth: a new order of things, and a world adapted to the condition of the righteous. There will be such changes produced in the earth, and such abodes suited up for the redeemed, that it will be proper to say that they are "new," <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>.<p>(2) the locality of that abode is not determined. No particular place is revealed as constituting heaven; nor is it intimated that there would be such a place. For anything that appears, the universe at large will be heaven - the earth and all worlds; and we are left free to suppose that the redeemed will yet occupy any position of the universe, and be permitted to behold the special glories of the divine character that are manifested in each of the worlds that he has made. Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>. That there may be some one place in the universe that will be their permanent home, and that will be more properly called heaven, where the glory of their God and Saviour will be especially manifested, is not improbable; but still there is nothing to prevent the hope and the belief that in the infinite duration that awaits them they will be permitted to visit all the worlds that God has made, and to learn in each, and from each, all that he has especially manifested of his own character and glory there.<p>(3) that future state will be entirely and forever free from all the consequences of the apostasy as now seen on the earth. There will be neither tears, nor sorrow, nor death, nor crying, nor pain, nor curse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>. It will, therefore, be a perfectly happy abode.<p>(4) it will be pure and holy. Nothing will ever enter there that shall contaminate and defile, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>. On this account, also, it will be a happy world, for:<p>(a) all real happiness has its foundation in holiness; and,<p>(b) the source of all the misery that the universe has experienced is sin. Let that be removed, and the earth would be happy; let it be extinguished from any world, and its happiness will be secure.<p>(5) it will be a world of perfect light, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>.

It is moulded on the lines of the epilogue to the astronomical section of Enoch (lxxxi. f.), where Enoch is left for one year with his children—“that thou mayest testify to them all.… Let thy heart be strong, for the good will announce righteousness to the good, but the sinners will die with the sinners, and the apostates go down with the apostates”. Two characteristic <span class="ital">motifs</span>, however, dominate the entire passage: (<span class="ital">a</span>) the vital importance of this book as a valid and authentic revelation, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) the nearness of the end. The former is heard in the definite claim of inspiration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches.

The latter is voiced thrice in a personal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.">Revelation 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly.

It is as a crucial revelation of the near future and a testimony to the authority and advent of the messiah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.">Revelation 22:20</a>) that this apocalypse claims to be read, and honoured in the churches. This general standpoint is clear enough, but the details are rather intricate. It is characteristic of the Apocalyse, as of ep. Barnabas, that the writer often leaves it indefinite whether God or Christ or an angel is speaking. Sometimes the divine voice is recognised to be that of Christ (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.">Revelation 4:1</a>), or may be inferred from the context to be that of an angel (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-15.htm" title="And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.">Revelation 17:15</a>; Revelation cf.1 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.">Revelation 19:9</a>), perhaps as the divine spokesman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-5.htm" title="And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful....">Revelation 21:5-6</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.">Revelation 22:7</a>). But frequently, even when the seer is addressed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-4.htm" title="And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.">Revelation 10:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>), the voice or Bath-Qol is anonymous (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-12.htm" title="And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.">Revelation 11:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm" title="And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.">Revelation 12:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:">Revelation 14:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth.">Revelation 16:1</a>; Revelation cf.17).
