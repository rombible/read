I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.">Revelation 21:6</a>) we should render, <span class= "ital">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.</span> (See Note as above, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.">Isaiah 44:6</a>.) The repetition of these glorious titles is not a mere idle repetition, or designed to give a rhetorical fulness to the peroration of the book: it is closely allied with the preceding thought. The warning has been given that men by continuing in sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-11.htm" title="He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.">Revelation 22:11</a>) are inviting against themselves the law by which act ripens to habit, and habit makes character, and character forms destiny. The moral laws set going by sin work thus:—Retribution is no dream: it is a terrible fact: it is written large over nature. But the eternal laws of God, though righteously ordered, are not God: the refuge from the eternal laws which we invoke against ourselves by our sin is to be found in the Eternal God: “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.” For those hunted by the wickedness of their own doings, God himself provides a refuge: underneath all laws are the everlasting arms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-27.htm" title="The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>). The next verses set the way of refuge and safety before us.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:6-19 The Lord Jesus spake by the angel, solemnly confirming the contents of this book, particularly of this last vision. He is the Lord God faithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed them to holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christ will come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. He refused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him for offering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worship of saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to the declarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effect upon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Never let us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for the First and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do his commandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked and unrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies, therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place or condition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churches this morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of the perfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and general invitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises and of the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and by convictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come to Christ for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth and in heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any should hesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come and take of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or reads these words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All are condemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by adding to it, or taking from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am Alpha and Omega ... - See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>. The idea here is, that he will thus show that he is the first and the last - the beginning and the end. He originated the whole plan of salvation, and he will determine its close; he formed the world, and he will wind up its affairs. In the beginning, the continuance, and the end, he will be recognized as the same being presiding over and controlling all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The Ethiopic version adds, "the beginning and end of days", or time.

Ed. ii. on this passage. The Lord Jesus plainly speaks here: and there are three clauses, the first of which we weighed at ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, said the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.">Revelation 1:8</a>, where the Father speaks of Himself; the second we considered at ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.

I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.">Revelation 21:6</a>, where again the Father speaks. Now, in the present passage, the three clauses are accumulated, a most manifest proof of the glory of the Lord Jesus; who testifies concerning Himself both those things which the Father had spoken concerning Himself, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm" title="And he said to me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.">Revelation 21:6</a>, and those things which He Himself had spoken concerning Himself, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:">Revelation 1:17</a>. Is it then one and the same sentiment which is expressed in a threefold form? Nay, something more is contained in it. The clause <span class="greekheb">Α</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="greekheb">Ω</span> is as it were the basis of those titles, which we have just noticed, of God and Christ; and it has a kind of general and as it were hieroglyphic force, to be determined by the other titles which follow. This is first spoken by the Father, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, said the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.">Revelation 1:8</a>; and the second answers to it, in which Christ calls Himself <span class="ital">the First and the Last</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:">Revelation 1:17</a>. Artemonius, who is excellently refuted by Wolf, translates it, <span class="ital">most excellent and most abject</span>. He Himself by Isaiah explains it, as <span class="ital">Him, before whom and after whom there is no other</span> God, the Author of salvation. This is at the commencement of the book. At the close, He who sits upon the throne says, <span class="ital">I am</span> <span class="greekheb">Α</span> and <span class="greekheb">Ω</span>: and He Himself explains it, <span class="ital">the Beginning and the End</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm" title="And he said to me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.">Revelation 21:6</a>. Then the Lord Jesus says, <span class="ital">I</span> <span class="greekheb">Α</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="greekheb">Ω</span>: and He also adds the explanation, but a twofold one: for He both repeats that saying of His, <span class="ital">the First and the Last</span>, and now, when the throne <span class="ital">of God and of the Lamb</span> is in the new Jerusalem, speaking of Himself, He adds that, which the Father had spoken, <span class="ital">the Beginning and the End</span>. It is put without the article, <span class="greekheb">πρῶτος καὶ ἔσχατος</span>, and that too in the primary copies; but with the article, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀρχὴ καὶ τὸ τέλος</span>, just as <span class="greekheb">τὸ Α καὶ τὸ Ω</span>, which is a remarkable sign of a kind of gradation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[246] AB Vulg. omit <span class="greekheb">εἰμι</span>: but <span class="ital">h</span> Orig. 4,6<span class="ital">c</span>, 21<span class="ital">b</span>, Cypr. 294, and Rec.

These words, which appropriately open and close the book (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>), occur (like those in ver. 11 above) continually in Isaiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm">Isaiah 48:12</a>). All three titles are here combined, as if to finally gather up into one impressive assertion the titles hitherto used separately (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>). "The first title is symbolical; the second is borrowed from the Old Testament; the third is philosophical "('Speaker's Commentary'). </body></html>
