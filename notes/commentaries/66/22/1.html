The river is full of water, and that water is the emblem of life: it is the beautiful symbol of life in its gladness, purity, activity, and fulness. The garden of Eden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm" title="And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became into four heads.">Genesis 2:10</a>) had its river. Even in the wilderness Israel had from the smitten rock the water which gushed out like a river (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-41.htm" title="He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.">Psalm 105:41</a>). Prophets, in their pictures of the ages of blessing, almost invariably introduced the river, or broad stream. Joel saw a fountain out of the house of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>). Zechariah spoke of living waters from Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>); but Ezekiel had the fullest vision when he beheld the stream which deepened and broadened in its onward progress from under the threshold of the house of God, and carried life in its train: everything lived whither the water came (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every thing that lives, which moves, wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live where the river comes.">Ezekiel 47:9</a>); thus did all prophets speak of the river of God’s pleasures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm" title="They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house; and you shall make them drink of the river of your pleasures.">Psalm 36:8</a>). The teaching of our Lord threw new light on the prophetic imagery; the pure delights of spiritual joy and communion with God were vouchsafed to men by the presence of the Holy Spirit, the Giver of Life. In the bestowal of that spirit of life did Christ give true satisfaction to the thirsting souls of men. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.">John 4:10-14, Joh_7:37-39</a>.) The source of the river is in the <span class= "ital">throne.</span> Ezekiel’s river took rise in the temple; but in our vision there is no temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm" title="And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.">Revelation 21:22</a>). We are brought nearer, even to the throne: it is the throne (not “thrones”)—one throne of God and the Lamb. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/revelation/22.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Revelation<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE CITY, THE CITIZENS, AND THE KING</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb....">Revelation 22:1-11</a>Is the vision of the New Jerusalem to be realized in the present or in the future? Such features as the existence of ‘nations’ and ‘kings of the earth’ outside of it {vs. 21, 24}, and leaves of the tree of life being ‘for the healing of the nations,’ favour the former reference, while its place in the book, after the first and second resurrections and the judgment and at the very end of the whole, seems to oblige us to hold by the latter. But the question must be answered in the light of the fact that the Christian life is one in essence in both worlds, and that the difference between the conditions of the society of the redeemed here and there is only one of degree. The city ‘has already come down from heaven; its perfect form waits to be manifested. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage is partly the close of that vision {vs. 1-5}, and partly the beginning of the epilogue of the whole book {vs. 6-11}. The closing description of the city is saturated with allusions to Old Testament prophecy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is like the finale of some great concerto, in which the themes that have sounded throughout it are all gathered up in the last majestic, melodious crash. Here at the farthest point to which mortal eyes are allowed to pierce, the ‘tree of life’ that the first of mortal eyes had looked on waves its branches again. The end has circled round to the beginning. But now there is no more prohibition to pluck and eat, and now it grows, not in a garden, but in a city where the perfection of human society is entered into. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here, on the last page of Scripture, the river, the music of whose ripple had been heard by Ezekiel and Zechariah bringing life to everything that it laved, and by the Psalmist making glad the city of God,’ flows with a broader, fuller stream, and is fouled by no stains, but is ‘clear as crystal.’ River and tree have the same epithet, and bring the same gift to the citizens. All the blessings which Jesus gives are summed up, both in John’s Gospel and in the Apocalypse, as life.’ The only true life is to live as God’s redeemed servants, and that life is ours here and now if we are His. It is but a ‘stream’ of the river that gladdens us here, the fruit has not yet its full flavor nor abundance.’ It is life, more life, for which we pant,’ and the desire will be satisfied there when the river runs always full, and every month the fruit hangs ripe and ready to be dropped into happy hands from among the healing leaves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In verses 3 and 4 we pass from the city to the citizens. Perfect purity clothes them all. There shall be no more anything accursed’; that is, any unclean thing drawing down necessarily the divine ‘curse,’ and therefore there shall be no separation, no film of distance between the King and the people, but ‘the throne of God and the Lamb shall be therein.’ The seer has already beheld the Lamb close by the throne of God, but now he sees Him sharing it in indissoluble union. Perfect purity leads to perfect union with God and {or rather in} Christ, and unbroken, glad submission to His regal rule. And that perfect submission is the occupation and delight of all the citizens. They are His bond-servants,’ and their fetters are golden chains of honour and ornament. They ‘do Him service,’ ministering as priests, and all their acts are ‘begun, continued, and ended in Him.’ Having been faithful over a few things, they are made rulers over many things, and are yet bond-servants, though rulers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In that higher service the weary schism between the active and the contemplative life is closed up. Mary and Martha end their long variance, and gazing on His face does not hinder active obedience, nor does doing Him service distract from beholding His beauty. His name shall be in their foreheads,’ conspicuous and unmistakable, no longer faintly traced or often concealed, but flaming on their brows. They are known to be His, because their characters are conformed to His. They bear ‘the marks of Jesus’ in complete and visible assimilation to Him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The vision closes with an echo of Old Testament prophecy {<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm" title="The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you: but the LORD shall be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.">Isaiah 60:19</a>}. ‘No night’ - perhaps the most blessed of all John’s negative descriptions of the future state, indicating the removal for ever of all the evil and woe symbolized by darkness, and pointing to a state in which no artifices of ours are needed to brighten our gloom with poor, man-made candles, nor any created light, though mighty and resplendent as the sun, whose beams fade into invisibility before the immortal radiance that pours out for ever from the throne, brightening every glorified face that is turned to its lustre. Thus seeing, serving, and being like ‘God and the Lamb,’ they, as a consequence, shall reign for ever and ever,’ for they are as He is, and while He lives and reigns they also live and reign. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With verse 6 begins the epilogue. An angel speaks, the same as in chapter 1:1 - is represented as ‘signifying’ the ‘revelation’ to John. He now, as it were, sets his seal on his completed roll of prophecy. To discriminate between the words of the angel and of Jesus is impossible. Jesus speaks through him. ‘Behold, I come quickly’ cannot be merely the angel’s voice. As in verse 12, a deeper voice speaks through his lips. The purpose of that solemn announcement is to impress on the Asiatic churches and through them on the whole Church through all time, the importance of keeping ‘the words of the prophecy of this book.’ ‘Quickly’ - and yet nineteen hundred years have gone since then? Yes; and during them all Jesus has been coming, and the words of this book have progressively been in process of fulfilment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, the speedy coming is enforced as a reason for not sealing up the prophecy, as had been commanded in chapter x. 4, and elsewhere in the Old Testament. And a very solemn thought closes our lesson - that there is a moment, the eve of any great day of the Lord,’ when there is no more time or opportunity for change of moral or spiritual disposition. ‘Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now.’ Let us ‘redeem the time,’ buy back the opportunity while yet it is within our grasp. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb....">Revelation 22:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">And </span>— Proceeding with his description of the heavenly city, the apostle observes, <span class="ital">he </span>— That is, the angel who condescended to be his guide on this occasion; <span class="ital">showed me a pure river of the water of life </span>— The ever fresh and fructifying influence of the Holy Spirit; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar....">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>, where also the trees are mentioned which <span class="ital">bear fruit every month, </span>that is, perpetually. <span class="ital">Proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb — All things that the Father hath, </span>saith the Son of God, <span class="ital">are mine; </span>even the throne of his glory. <span class="ital">In the midst of the street of it </span>— Here is the paradise of God, mentioned chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.">Revelation 2:7</a>; <span class="ital">and on either side of the river was the tree of life </span>— As this river ran through the chief street in the midst of the city, so there were planted on each side of it beautiful trees, not only to serve for ornament and refreshment, but which, like the tree of life in paradise, should make the inhabitants immortal; <span class="ital">which bare twelve manner of fruits</span> — Which produced a great variety of pleasant fruits, and in such plenty, that ripe fruit was <span class="ital">yielded every month </span>— So that all might freely partake of them at all seasons. <span class="ital">And the leaves of the tree </span>are <span class="ital">for the healing of the nations </span>— That is, for the <span class="ital">preserving, </span>not the <span class="ital">restoring, </span>of spiritual health; for no sickness or infirmity, of mind or body, is, or can be there: beneath the salutary shade of these trees no disease can ever invade any individual of the nations of the saved, but perpetual health shall exist and flourish in them all.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-5 All streams of earthly comfort are muddy; but these are clear, and refreshing. They give life, and preserve life, to those who drink of them, and thus they will flow for evermore. These point to the quickening and sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to sinners through Christ. The Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, applies this salvation to our souls by his new-creating love and power. The trees of life are fed by the pure waters of the river that comes from the throne of God. The presence of God in heaven, is the health and happiness of the saints. This tree was an emblem of Christ, and of all the blessings of his salvation; and the leaves for the healing of the nations, mean that his favour and presence supply all good to the inhabitants of that blessed world. The devil has no power there; he cannot draw the saints from serving God, nor can he disturb them in the service of God. God and the Lamb are here spoken of as one. Service there shall be not only freedom, but honour and dominion. There will be no night; no affliction or dejection, no pause in service or enjoyment: no diversions or pleasures or man's inventing will there be wanted. How different all this from gross and merely human views of heavenly happiness, even those which refer to pleasures of the mind!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he showed me a pure river of water of life - In the New Jerusalem; the happy abode of the redeemed. The phrase "water of life," means living or running water, like a spring or fountain, as contrasted with a stagnant pool. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>. The allusion here is doubtless to the first Eden, where a river watered the garden (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>, seq.), and as this is a description of Eden recovered, or Paradise regained, it was natural to introduce a river of water also, yet in such a way as to accord with the general description of that future abode of the redeemed. It does not spring up, therefore, from the ground, but flows from the throne of God and the Lamb. Perhaps, also, the writer had in his eye the description in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>, where a stream issues from under the temple, and is parted in different directions.<p>Clear as crystal - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>.<p>Proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb - Flowing from the foot of the throne. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. This idea is strictly in accordance with Oriental imagery. In the East, fountains and running streams constituted an essential part of the image of enjoyment and prosperity (see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>), and such fountains were common in the courts of Oriental houses. Here, the river is an emblem of peace, happiness, plenty; and the essential thought in its flowing from the throne is, that all the happiness of heaven proceeds from God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>Re 22:1-21.

The throne which belongs to God and the Lamb[4379] is the source of this stream, for only through the mediation of Christ as the Lamb, is the participation of believers in the eternal life of God inferred.

But against the context also is the explanation of Hengstenb., that, in the present period, the life-forces arising from the Jerusalem, even now in heaven, are to heal the sickness of the heathen, i.e., to effect their conversion; for what is expressed concerning the leaves of the tree of life refers to the same time as that which is said of the fruits. This has been correctly acknowledged by those who have thought of the conversion, in the future world, of heathen to whom in this life the gospel has not been preached,[4386] or of the full development of the weak faith of the heathen.[4387] But both are contrary to the purpose of the context, which, just because of their faith, makes the heathen[4388] share in the glory of the city.

In connection with this, the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΘΕΡΑΠΕΊΑΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΘΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is as little to be pressed, in the sense that a still present sickness of the heathen were presupposed, since it might possibly be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm" title="And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.">Revelation 21:4</a>, that the tears which God will wipe away from the blessed are the sign of pains still endured; but as the tears which are wept because of earthly sorrow are wiped away in eternal life, so the healing leaves of the tree of life serve for the healing of the sickness from which the heathen have suffered in their earthly life, but shall suffer no longer in the new Jerusalem. If they were previously hungry and thirsty, now they are also to be satisfied;[4389] if they were previously blind, miserable, and without the power of life,[4390] now they are to share in the enjoyment of all glory, holiness, and blessedness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΠᾶΝ ΚΑΤΆΘΕΜΑ ΟὐΚ ἜΣΤΑΙ ἜΤΙ</span></span></span>.

We are also meant to think of the River that watered the ancient paradise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm" title="And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became into four heads.">Genesis 2:10</a>, and of such parallels to Ezekiel’s vision as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm" title="There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-9.htm" title="You visit the earth, and water it: you greatly enrich it with the river of God, which is full of water: you prepare them corn, when you have so provided for it.">Psalm 65:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>. The original type, of which these Prophecies are developments, is the fact that there was a natural spring, that of Siloam, in the precincts of the Temple at Jerusalem. We are not told here, as in the old Paradise, that the River is fourfold: but if the City stands on a pyramidal mountain (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm" title="And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.

"And" connects this part of the vision with what precedes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9-27</a>). It would have been better, perhaps, if the twenty-first chapter had included the first five verses of the twenty-second, so as to take in the whole of the description of the heavenly Jerusalem. But there is a break at this point, as is indicated by the repetition of "And he showed me," which points to a new phase or section of the vision. In the previous section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9-27</a>) the angel had showed St. John the city and its wails with their gates and foundations; in this section he shows him the river of the water of life, and the tree of life. The latter part of each section is occupied with the evangelist's own observations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3-5</a>), for we cannot suppose that the phrase, "these words," in ver. 6, is intended to apply specially to anything in these particular sections. <span class="accented">He</span> is the angel mentioned in ver. 9, and again referred to in vers. 10, 15, 16, 17. Most probably the pronoun "he" in ver. 6 does not refer to the same angel as this one. <span class="accented">River.</span> The source of this stream, its course or channel, and its fertile banks, are mentioned or implied in what follows; but there is no reference to any estuary or mouth: eternity is the ocean in which this river is lost. <span class="cmt_word">Of water of life.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f5d;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> is perhaps identical in meaning with "living water," <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, but is properly distinguished from it in translation. The two expressions are peculiar to St. John's writings in the New Testament; the genitival form, which is the more Hebraizing, only occurs in this book in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1, 17</a>; whereas the participial and more classical form is confined to the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>). "Living water," in its simplest literalness, means such water as is pure, flowing, clear, fresh, and wholesome; not stagnant, or turbid, or salt. Hence it is a proper term for the water of a beautiful and fertilizing river. Here, however, the genitival form reminds us of the familiar expression, similarly moulded, "the tree of life," which inclines us to think that" water of life" signifies water possessing life giving powers, water which restores, refreshes, supports life, and is therefore to be compared with "living water" taken in its spiritual sense. Of this whosoever drinketh shall never thirst again; when it has been once received within the soul, it becomes a well of water springing up into everlasting life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">clear</span>, or <span class="accented">transparent.</span> We seldom use the rendering of the Revised Version, <span class="accented">bright</span>, as an epithet of water. <span class="accented">As crystal</span> (see note on Revelation 4:6, the only other place in the New Testament where the word occurs). The source of the river was in the Divine throne, the seat of the Triune God and the crucified Saviour. All eternal life is derived from our heavenly Father by the Holy Spirit for the sake of the Redeemer. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Pure<p>Omit.<p>Clear (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm">Luke 23:11</a>.
