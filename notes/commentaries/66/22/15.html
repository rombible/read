(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>.) The allusion to the dogs outside the city is hardly appreciated by Westerns. In the East, however, “troops of hungry and semi-wild dogs used to wander about the fields and streets of the cities, devouring dead bodies and other offal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-11.htm" title="Him that dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD has spoken it.">1Kings 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-4.htm" title="Him that dies of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.">1Kings 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm" title="And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession?

The sins enumerated here are similar to those mentioned in the last chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8</a>); it is the reiteration, therefore, of the warning that those who would enter in must break off their sins by righteousness.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:6-19 The Lord Jesus spake by the angel, solemnly confirming the contents of this book, particularly of this last vision. He is the Lord God faithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed them to holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christ will come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. He refused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him for offering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worship of saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to the declarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effect upon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Never let us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for the First and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do his commandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked and unrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies, therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place or condition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churches this morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of the perfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and general invitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises and of the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and by convictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come to Christ for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth and in heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any should hesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come and take of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or reads these words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All are condemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by adding to it, or taking from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For without are dogs - The wicked, the depraved, the vile: for of such characters the dogs, an unclean animal among the Jews, was regarded as a symbol, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>.

Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a>. Here the word is used of those whose moral impurity excludes them from the New Jerusalem. "As a term of reproach, the word on the lips of a Jew, signified chiefly impurity; of a Greek, impudence. The herds of dogs which prowl about Eastern cities, without a home and without an owner, feeding on the refuse and filth of the streets, quarreling among themselves, and attacking the passer-by, explain both applications of the image" (Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>).<p>Sorcerers<p>See on  <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>.<p>Whoremongers (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., better, fornicators.<p>Maketh (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Or doeth.
