The glory and felicity set forth in the preceding chapter, and continued in the five verses we have just considered, being great above all imagination, certain as the word of prophecy, and lasting without end, must, if duly considered, be a powerful encouragement to us, and persuasive to constancy in the profession and practice of pure Christianity, whatever difficulties or dangers may attend it. What follows, to the end, is the conclusion of the whole book, or a sort of epilogue, which confirms the truth of the prophecies contained in these revelations, shows the importance and use of them, and is well fitted to leave them with strong impressions on the hearts of the readers, to preserve them from complying with any corruptions of the Christian faith and worship, and encourage their constancy in the ways of truth and righteousness. <span class="ital">And he said, These sayings are true and faithful </span>— All the things which thou hast heard and seen shall be faithfully accomplished in their order, and are infallibly true. Thus the angel ratifies all the forementioned particulars, by a repetition of the same solemn assurance which he had before given, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

He is the Lord God faithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed them to holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christ will come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. He refused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him for offering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worship of saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to the declarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effect upon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Never let us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for the First and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do his commandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked and unrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies, therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place or condition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churches this morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of the perfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and general invitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises and of the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and by convictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come to Christ for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth and in heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any should hesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come and take of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or reads these words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All are condemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by adding to it, or taking from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he said unto me - The angel-interpreter, who had showed John the vision of the New Jerusalem, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>.

That is, the angel that talked with him, and showed him the above things: <p>these sayings are faithful and true; not only what are delivered in particular concerning the new Jerusalem state, in which are many things new, and unheard of before, and which may seem strange, and even incredible, but all that are written in this book, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7</a> all which are "faithful"; to be believed by all that read them, and in the fulfilment of which the faithfulness of God is engaged and displayed: and they are true; for they come from the God of truth, that cannot lie, and are to be credited, and will have a certain accomplishment: this is said to secure the divine authority of this book against the gainsayers of it, whom the Holy Ghost foresaw would arise in the world; and which is here, and in the following part of this chapter, supported by the testimonies of Christ, of his angel, and of John his servant. <p>And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done; the "Lord" God is the Lord Jesus Christ, as appears by comparing this with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a> and this is a very glaring proof of the deity of Christ, since he is not only called the Lord God, but the Lord God of the holy prophets; of the prophets of the Old Testament, who foretold things to come, and spake of the Messiah, his person, office, sufferings, death, and the glory that should follow; and of the prophets of the New Testament, who had a gift of explaining the prophecies of the Old, as well as some of them predicted future events; and both sorts were holy men, set part by God for this office, and had principles of holiness wrought in them, and were moved by the Holy Ghost; these Christ inspired, and qualified with gifts suitable to their work; and he is, as the Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin version, and the Oriental versions read, "the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-32.htm">1 Corinthians 14:32</a> who had power over their spirits, could come at them, and did impress them with a sense and knowledge of divine and future things, which none but God can do: the same sent an angel of his, one of his ministering spirits he has under his command, perhaps the same that here speaks, for so reads the Syriac version, "sent me his angel": to show to John, and by him to all the saints, and to all the servants and followers of the Lamb, things that were in a very little time to begin to come to pass, till all were fulfilled; and even those at the greatest distance were, and are to be fulfilled within a little time, with respect to God, with whom a thousand years are as one day, and in comparison of eternity, and even of the time which had elapsed from the beginning of the world; and these things were shown in the various visions of the seals, trumpets, vials, and others; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> And he said unto me, These sayings <i>are</i> faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</span><p>(2) This whole book is concluded and made up by a confirmation, and a salutation. The confirmation has three parts: the words of the angel Re 22:15, the words of Christ, Re 22:16,17 and the supplication made by John from divine authority, Re 22:18-20. By the speech of the angel this prophecy is confirmed to Re 22:7,8, and then he speaks of the use of this book in the verses following. The prophecy is first confirmed by the angel from the nature of it, that it is faithful and true: Secondly, from the nature of the efficient cause, both principal, which is God, and instrumental, which is the angel in this verse. Thirdly, from the promises of God concerning his coming to effect all these things, and concerning our salvation; Re 22:7. Fourthly, from the testification of John himself; Re 22:8. The rest of the speech of the angel rending to the same end, John interrupted or broke off by his unadvised act of worshipping him, in the same verse, which the angel forbidding, teaches him that adoration must be given not to him, but only to God, as for himself, that he is of such nature and office, as he may not be adored: which thing also was in like manner done; Re 19:10.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/22.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done....">Revelation 22:6-21</a>.

In both respects this conclusion corresponds to the introduction of the whole (chs. 1–3), in which likewise the double purpose enters, viz., that of communicating the prophetical scriptures to the churches, and that of designating the contents of revelation as such from the very beginning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ εἷπέν μοι</span>, viz., the angel, who spoke at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9</a>.[4396] This is acknowledged also by Ebrard, who, however, finds here not an angelic declaration interposed anew, but a repetition of the account of John, who now once more recalls the angelic declaration previously received. Ebrard decides, logically, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8</a> sqq. there is presented not a repetition of the event actually occurring, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>, but only a repetition of the account of the same. This conception, however, is not only in conflict with the mode of statement in the text, but is also improper for the reason that thereby the return, indispensable to the harmony of the entire Apoc., from the series of visions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.">Revelation 4:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>, revealing the future[4397] to the standpoint of the introductory vision,[4398] is cut off.

Thus the Lord, who is the God of the spirits of all the prophets, has especially manifested himself now in the spirit of John; this God has communicated to John[4400] his true words of revelation by signifying to him, through the ministry of the angel, the things which are to come, in order that he may proclaim them to his servants.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῖς ΔΟΎΛΟΙς ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span>, i.e., believers in general, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΑῖς ἘΚΚΛΗΣΊΑΙς</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches.

As the Divine authority, so also especially the chief contents of the now completed revelation are again made prominent,—this occurs by the angel speaking directly in the name of the coming Lord himself,[4402]—and then the parenetic inference which this affords (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΑΚΆΡΙΟς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>)[4403] is added by the angel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8</a> sqq., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him.

The part. pres.[4404] marks, without regard to time, the idea of (ecstatic) hearing and seeing of these things, and accordingly the prophetic dignity of John, who just by hearing and seeing all that has been “shown” him for eye and ear, has become the Divinely-appointed interpreter of the Divine mysteries. Thus the pres. particularly shows that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΆΥΤΑ</span></span></span>[4405] refers not only to what has been reported, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a> sq., but also to the entire revelation of God. On the other hand, the aor. occurs (<span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὅτε ἤκουσα</span>) where that which is special, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a> sq., is treated. The variations, consequently, which by additions to the mere <span class="greekheb">ἤκουσα</span> recur to the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8</a>,[4406] yield an absolutely false interpretation; for John falls down before the angel, because he thinks that in the speech heard (<span class="greekheb">ὅτε ἤκουσα</span>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done....">Revelation 22:6-7</a> (consider especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.">Revelation 22:7</a>), he recognizes the Lord himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου τῶν προφητῶν</span>. That the prophets are here especially emphasized as the brethren of John, distinguished from the rest of believers,[4407] is natural, because it is now the intention to assert the prophetical authority of John and his book, which the rest of believers are to receive and keep as a testimony of the Lord. Corresponding also with this, is the fact that the angel immediately imparts the command[4408] not to seal[4409] the revelations written in this book, but to communicate them to believers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ καιρὸς γὰρ ἐγγύς ἐστιν</span>.

In connection with this, the summons to those doing wrong, and the filthy (<span class="greekheb">ὁ ῥυπαρός</span>)[4411] to continue in their godless course, and thus to hasten to sure ruin, is not without a certain irony.[4412] [See Note XCVIII., p. 494.] The purpose of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-11.htm" title="He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.">Revelation 22:11</a> is the less to be mistaken, as the allusion to the retributive advent of the Lord not only immediately precedes (<span class="greekheb">ὁ καιρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγγύς έστιν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-10.htm" title="And he said to me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.">Revelation 22:10</a>), but also is added directly afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a> sq.), and here the impending righteous retribution is expressly emphasized: <span class="greekheb">ὁ μισθός μου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-10.htm" title="Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.">Isaiah 40:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-11.htm" title="Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the world, Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.">Isaiah 62:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς τὸ ἔργον ἐστὶν αὐτοῦ</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a>, read like a speech out of Christ’s own mouth, those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-13.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.">Revelation 22:13</a>[4413] like one of God himself; but, just because of this alternation, it is unnatural to ascribe both declarations to the angel, speaking in the name of Christ and God. On the other hand, the alternation of speakers appears too confused, if Christ himself and God be regarded as actually speaking, particularly since <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a> sq. (<span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐντ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>) is most easily regarded a parenetic digression of John. Hence the speeches of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be....">Revelation 22:12-13</a>, at the close of the book, must be conceived of here in the same way as the keynote of the entire speech of God given from the very beginning in the introduction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, said the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.">Revelation 1:8</a>. In the ancient prophetic way, John, who shows himself to be a true interpreter of Divine revelation, in two compendious Divine declarations, fixes the fundamental thoughts of this entire prophecy (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.">Revelation 22:20</a>); the very abruptness of these expressions is an indication that Christ and God do not actually enter into the scene as themselves speaking. The speech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a> sq., thus understood, forms then the transition from the speech of the angel actually present to the parenetic words of John, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a> sq.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐντολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>.
