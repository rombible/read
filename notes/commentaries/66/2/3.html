Christ knows and observes their state; though in heaven, yet he walks in the midst of his churches on earth, observing what is wrong in them, and what they want. The church of Ephesus is commended for diligence in duty. Christ keeps an account of every hour's work his servants do for him, and their labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. But it is not enough that we are diligent; there must be bearing patience, and there must be waiting patience. And though we must show all meekness to all men, yet we must show just zeal against their sins. The sin Christ charged this church with, is, not the having left and forsaken the object of love, but having lost the fervent degree of it that at first appeared. Christ is displeased with his people, when he sees them grow remiss and cold toward him. Surely this mention in Scripture, of Christians forsaking their first love, reproves those who speak of it with carelessness, and thus try to excuse indifference and sloth in themselves and others; our Saviour considers this indifference as sinful. They must repent: they must be grieved and ashamed for their sinful declining, and humbly confess it in the sight of God. They must endeavour to recover their first zeal, tenderness, and seriousness, and must pray as earnestly, and watch as diligently, as when they first set out in the ways of God. If the presence of Christ's grace and Spirit is slighted, we may expect the presence of his displeasure. Encouraging mention is made of what was good among them. Indifference as to truth and error, good and evil, may be called charity and meekness, but it is not so; and it is displeasing to Christ. The Christian life is a warfare against sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh. We must never yield to our spiritual enemies, and then we shall have a glorious triumph and reward. All who persevere, shall derive from Christ, as the Tree of life, perfection and confirmation in holiness and happiness, not in the earthly paradise, but in the heavenly. This is a figurative expression, taken from the account of the garden of Eden, denoting the pure, satisfactory, and eternal joys of heaven; and the looking forward to them in this world, by faith, communion with Christ, and the consolations of the Holy Spirit. Believers, take your wrestling life here, and expect and look for a quiet life hereafter; but not till then: the word of God never promises quietness and complete freedom from conflict here.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And hast borne - Hast borne up under trials; or hast borne with the evils with which you have been assailed. That is, you have not given way to murmuring or complaints in trial, you have not abandoned the principles of truth and yielded to the prevalence of error.<p>And hast patience - That is, in this connection, hast shown that thou canst bear up under these things with patience. This is a repetition of what is said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>, but in a somewhat different connection. There it rather refers to the trouble which they had experienced on account of the pretensions of false apostles, and the patient, persevering, and enduring spirit which they had shown in that form of trial; here the expression is more general, denoting a patient spirit in regard to all forms of trial.<p>And for my name's sake hast laboured - On account of me, and in my cause. That is, the labor here referred to, whatever it was, was to advance the cause of the Redeemer. In the word rendered "hast labored" (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  kekopiakas) there is a reference to the word used in the previous verse - "thy labor" (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  kopon sou); and the design is to show that the "labor," or trouble there referred to, was on account of him.<p>And hast not fainted - Hast not become exhausted, or wearied out, so as to give over. The word used here (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  kamno&#772;) occurs in only three places in the New Testament: "Lest ye be wearied, and faint," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3</a>; "The prayer of faith shall save the sick," <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>; and in the passage before us. It means properly to become weary and faint from toil, etc.; and the idea here is, that they had not become so wearied out as to give over from exhaustion. The sense of the whole passage is thus rendered by Prof. Stuart: "Thou canst not bear with false teachers, but thou canst bear with troubles and perplexities on account of me; thou hast undergone wearisome toil, but thou art not wearied out thereby." The state of mind, considered as the state of mind appropriate to a Christian, here represented, is, that we should not tolerate error and sin, but that we should bear up under the trials which they may incidentally occasion us; that we should have such a repugnance to evil that we cannot endure it, as evil, but that we should have such love to the Saviour and his cause as to be willing to bear anything, even in relation to that, or springing from that, that we may be called to suffer in that cause; that while we may be weary in his work, for our bodily strength may become exhausted (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>), we should not be weary of it; and that though we may have many perplexities, and may meet with much opposition, yet we should not relax our zeal, but should persevere with an ardor that never faints, until our Saviour calls us to our reward. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. borne &#8230; patience&#8212;The oldest manuscripts transpose these words.

A beautiful antithesis.<p>and &#8230; hast laboured, and hast not fainted&#8212;The two oldest manuscripts and oldest versions read, "and &#8230; hast not labored," omitting "and hast fainted." The difficulty which transcribers by English Version reading tried to obviate, was the seeming contradiction, "I know thy labor &#8230; and thou hast not labored."

The last verb (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is closely akin to toil (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in ver 2.
