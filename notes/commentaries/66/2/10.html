In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.">John 16:33</a>). He never conceals the difficulties or dangers of His service. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm" title="For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.">Acts 9:16</a>.) So here He proclaims, “Behold, the devil shall cast some. . . .”<p><span class= "bld">The devil.</span>—The LXX. translation gives this name to Satan, regarding him as the “accuser.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm" title="And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.">Revelation 12:10</a>, where he is described as the “accuser of the brethren.”)<p><span class= "bld">Tried.</span>—On the part of the adversary, the intention was that they might be <span class= "ital">tempted</span> from their allegiance to Christ. The real effect would be that they who endured would come forth tested and approved. The suffering would be for “ten days.” This is variously explained. Some think it applies to the periods of persecution; others understand it to mean a long persecution of ten years; others take it literally; others again view it as expressing completeness: the test would be thorough. The exhortation, “Be thou faithful (even) unto death,” seems to favour this last; while the mention of “ten days” was, perhaps, designed to remind them that the period of trial was limited by Him who knew what they could bear, and would be but a little while when compared with the life with which they would be crowned.<p><span class= "bld">A crown of life.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the crown of life.</span> A crown was given to the priest who presided at the Dionysian Mysteries, which were celebrated with great pomp at Smyrna. A crown was also given at the Olympian Games, which were held at Smyrna. If there is any allusion to either of these, the latter would be the most natural. Some hold, however, the crown—though the word is <span class= "ital">Stephanos, </span>not <span class= "ital">diadema</span>—is rather that of royalty than of victory. It is interesting to note that the narrative which tells of the death of Polycarp closes with words which it is difficult not to believe to be an allusion to this promise—“By his patience he overcame the unrighteous ruler, and received the crown of immortality” (<span class= "ital">Smyrn.

Bishop Newton supposes that these <span class="ital">ten days </span>mean <span class="ital">ten years, </span>according to the usual style of prophecy; and that the persecution of Dioclesian is referred to, which lasted that time, and was the greatest persecution that the primitive church ever endured, most grievously afflicting all the Asian, and indeed all the eastern churches. This persecution, he thinks, and none of the other general persecutions, answers the character here given, none of the others lasting so long as ten years. <span class="ital">Be thou faithful </span>— Our Lord does not say, <span class="ital">till I come, </span>as in the other letters, but <span class="ital">unto death </span>— Signifying that the angel of the church should quickly after seal his testimony with his blood, fifty years before the martyrdom of St. Polycarp, for whom some have mistaken him. <span class="ital">And I will give thee a crown of life </span>— The peculiar reward of them who are faithful unto death. <span class="ital">He that overcometh </span>— That is victorious unto the end; <span class="ital">shall not be hurt of the second death </span>— Though he may encounter the first death in this world for my sake, he shall not be injured by the second, namely, the lake of fire, the portion of the fearful, who do not overcome, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>; but he shall rest in everlasting security and peace, while those who desert the cause of Christ, and renounce their duty, for the preservation of this transitory life, shall be consigned to that state of misery where they shall seek death, but it shall for ever flee from them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-11 Our Lord Jesus is the First, for by him were all things made; he was before all things, with God, and is God himself. He is the Last, for he will be the Judge of all. As this First and Last, who was dead and is alive, is the believer's Brother and Friend, he must be rich in the deepest poverty, honourable amidst the lowest abasement, and happy under the heaviest tribulation, like the church of Smyrna. Many who are rich as to this world, are poor as to the next; and some who are poor outwardly, are inwardly rich; rich in faith, in good works, rich in privileges, rich in gifts, rich in hope. Where there is spiritual plenty, outward poverty may be well borne; and when God's people are made poor as to this life, for the sake of Christ and a good conscience, he makes all up to them in spiritual riches. Christ arms against coming troubles. Fear none of these things; not only forbid slavish fear, but subdue it, furnishing the soul with strength and courage. It should be to try them, not to destroy them. Observe, the sureness of the reward; I will give thee: they shall have the reward from Christ's own hand. Also, how suitable it is; a crown of life: the life worn out in his service, or laid down in his cause, shall be rewarded with a much better life, which shall be eternal. The second death is unspeakably worse than the first death, both in the agonies of it, and as it is eternal death: it is indeed awful to die, and to be always dying. If a man is kept from the second death and wrath to come, he may patiently endure whatever he meets with in this world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer - He did not promise them exemption from suffering. He saw that they were about to suffer, and he specifies the manner in which their affliction would occur. But he entreats and commands them not to be afraid. They were to look to the "crown of life," and to be comforted with the assurance that if they were faithful unto death, that would be, theirs. We need not dread suffering if we can hear the voice of the Redeemer encouraging us, and if he assures us that in a little while we shall have the crown of life.<p>Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison - Or, shall cause some of you to be cast into prison. He had just said that their persecutors were of the "synagogue of Satan." He here represents Satan, or the devil - another name of the same being - as about to throw them into prison. This would be done undoubtedly by the hands of men, but still Satan was the prime mover, or the instigator in doing it. It was common to cast those who were persecuted into prison. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-3.htm">Acts 12:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>. It is not said on what pretence, or by what authority, this would be done; but, as John had been banished to Patmos from Ephesus, it is probable that this persecution was raging in the adjacent places, and there is no improbability in supposing that many might be thrown into prison.<p>That ye may be tried - That the reality of your faith may be subjected to a test to show whether it is genuine. The design in the case is that of the Saviour, though Satan is allowed to do it. It was common in the early periods of the church to suffer religion to be subjected to trial amidst persecutions, in order to show that it was of heavenly origin, and to demonstrate its value in view of the world. This is, indeed, one of the designs of trial at all times, but this seemed eminently desirable when a new system of religion was about to be given to mankind. Compare the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>.<p>And ye shall have tribulation ten days - A short time; a brief period; a few days. It is possible, indeed, that this might have been literally ten days, but it is much more in accordance with the general character of this book, in regard to numbers, to suppose that the word "ten" here is used to denote a few. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-38.htm">1 Samuel 25:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-14.htm">Daniel 1:14</a>. We are wholly ignorant how long the trial actually lasted; but the assurance was that it would not be long, and they were to allow this thought to cheer and sustain them in their sorrows. Why should not the same thought encourage us now? Affliction in this life, however severe, can be but brief; and in the hope that it will soon end, why should we not bear it without complaining or repining?<p>Be thou faithful unto death - Implying, perhaps, that though, in regard to the church, the affliction would be brief, yet that it might be fatal to some of them, and they who were thus about to die should remain faithful to their Saviour until the hour of death. In relation to all, whether they were to suffer a violent death or not, the same injunction and the same promise was applicable. It is true of everyone who is a Christian, in whatever manner he is to die, that if he is faithful unto death, a crown of life awaits him. Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>.<p>And I will give thee a crown of life - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>.

The promise here is somewhat different from what was made to the faithful in Ephesus <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>, but the same thing substantially is promised them - happiness hereafter, or an admission into heaven. In the former case it is the peaceful image of those admitted into the scenes of paradise; here it is the triumph of the crowned martyr. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

God's people undergo sufferings of various sorts, as the Christians of those times did, scourgings, imprisonment, confiscation of goods, and death itself in various shapes; and these are certain, they shall suffer them; they are all known beforehand to Christ, and he sometimes gives his people previous notice of them, nor should they indulge a slavish fear about them. It is reported of Polycarp, bishop of this church at Smyrna, in a letter written by the church itself (n) that three days before he suffered, he dreamed his pillow, on which he laid his head, was on fire; upon which, awaking, he said to those that were by him, that he should be burnt for Christ; and when he came to suffer, as he was led along, a voice was heard by the bystanders, Polycarp, be strong, and play the man, <p>Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison; which has been the lot of many of the saints, and was of some, even of the faithful ministers of the word in this interval; in which Satan had an hand, instigating their enemies to prevent and stop the progress of the Gospel, and deter others both from preaching and professing it: the end was in the permission of it, <p>that ye may be tried; that their graces might be tried, their faith, love, zeal, courage, faithfulness, and constancy. Suffering times are trying times, whether men are real Christians or not; whether they have the true grace of God or not; and whether the principles they hold are right and true, and are worth, and will bear suffering for: <p>and ye shall have tribulation ten days: meaning it may be the ten persecutions under the Roman emperors; the "first" was under Nero, in the year 64 or 66; the "second" was under Domitian, about the year 93; the "third" was under Trojan, in the year 104; the "fourth" was under Hadrian, in the year 125; the "fifth" was under Marcus Antoninus, in the year 151; the "sixth" was under Septimius Severus, in the year 197; the "seventh" was under Maximinus, in the years 235, 236, 237; the "eighth" was under Decius, in the year 250; the "ninth" was under Valerianus, in the year 257; and the "tenth" was under Dioclesian, in the year 303. Austin (o) reckons the ten persecutions thus: the first by Nero, the second by Domitian, the third by Trojan, the fourth by Antoninus, the fifth by Severus, the sixth by Maximus, the seventh by Decius, the eighth by Valerianus, the ninth by Aurelianus, the tenth by Dioclesian and Maximianus. Others, inasmuch as Nero's persecution was before this vision, reckon the ten persecutions thus: Domitian, Trojan, M. Antoninus, Verus and Lucius, Severus, Maximinus, Decius, Valerianus, Aurelianus, Dioclesianus, Licinius: the Dioclesian persecution lasted ten years almost throughout: and some think that this last persecution, which held ten years, is here particularly meant, and not without some good reason; since it is usual in prophetic writings, and in this book of the Revelation, to put days for years; so that these ten days may be the ten years the last persecution held, and at which time the period of this church state ended, and that of Pergamos took place, <p>Be thou faithful unto death: which is an address to the ministers in this interval, to be faithful in preaching the pure and unmixed Gospel of Christ; in a constant administration of the ordinances, as they were delivered; in watching over the souls of men under their care, reproving, exhorting, &amp;c. with all longsuffering; continuing in the discharge of duty, though in continual danger of death, and though it issued in it. And also to the churches and the members of them, to continue believing in Christ, professing his name, striving for his Gospel, attending on his ordinances, and following him whithersoever he went; though this should expose them to sufferings, even unto death, which it became them cheerfully to undergo: and to which they are encouraged by what follows, <p>and I will give thee a crown of life; which may refer not only to eternal life, which is so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>; because of the glory of that state, and its everlasting continuance, and is in the possession and gift of Christ; but to the deliverance of the Christians from persecution, by Constantine; who coming to the imperial crown, that became not only a crown of glory to him, but of life to the church, and was as life from the dead unto the saints: to dead men is promised a crown of life, in allusion to the Gentiles, who crowned their dead (p), <p>(n) Apud Euseb.

For so commonly both in this book and in Daniel, years are signified by days: that God by this might declare, that the space of time is appointed by him and the same very short. Now because John wrote this book in the end of Domitian the Emperor's reign, as Justinus and Ireneus do witness, it is altogether necessary that this should be referred to that persecution which was done by the authority of the emperor Trajan: who began to make havock of the Christian church in the tenth year of his reign, as the historians do write: and his bloody persecution continued until Adrian the emperor had succeeded in his stead: The space of which time is precisely ten years, which are here mentioned.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>.

But the number is purely of a schematic nature,[1076] and signifies not a long[1077] but a short time.[1078] [See Note XXX., p. 156.] The entire period of the universal tribulation is schematically represented by forty-two months.[1079] The chief misinterpretations are known already by N. de Lyra: that the ten days are ten years, in which are reckoned the persecution under Domitian[1080] and that under Decius;[1081] that the ten persecutions of Christians are meant;[1082] that the ten days correspond to and signify the Ten Commandments, and that the persecution of the entire Church will continue as long as the Ten Commandments are in force, i.e., until the end of the world, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Without any external combination, the admonition <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΊΝΟΥ ΠΙΣΤΌς</span></span></span> follows, which in the limitation <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΧΡΙ ΘΑΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> reaches farther than has been thus far represented by the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΛῖΨΙς</span></span></span>.

A man may love to endure, but he does not love what he endures” (Aug. <span class="ital">Conf.</span> x. 28). Ill-treatment, as well as misrepresentation, is traced back to a diabolic source, in the common early Christian manner (Weinel, 13 f.). The Imperial authorities (<span class="greekheb">διάβολος</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1 Peter 5:8</a>), although often instigated by the Jews, had the sole power of inflicting imprisonment, in this case for a refusal to worship the emperor’s image; the prophet here predicts an imminent persecution of this kind (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm" title="For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.">Acts 9:16</a>, and above Introd. § 6) lasting for a short and limited time (<span class="greekheb">δέκα ἡμ</span>. see reff., originally due to the rough Semitic division of a month into decades). The local intensity of feeling upon the Imperial cultus may be gathered from the fact that in 23 A.D. Smyrna had secured from Tiberius and the senate, after keen competition, the coveted distinction of possessing the second temple decreed by the province to the Imperial cultus. Hence the struggle anticipated here is desperate (<span class="greekheb">ἄχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θ</span>.); martyrdom is no remote contingency. Compare Ep. Lugd., where the martyr-crisis is taken as an anticipation of the final persecution (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-10.htm" title="Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come on all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.">Revelation 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/13-7.htm" title="And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations....">Revelation 13:7-15</a>): “with all his might the adversary assailed us, giving us a hint of what his unbridled advent would be like at the end”; the martyrs “endured nobly all the assaults heaped on them by the mob. They were shouted at, struck, haled about, robbed, stoned, imprisoned; in fact they suffered all that an infuriated mob likes to inflict on enemies and opponents.”—Then follows a commandment with promise: <span class="greekheb">γίνου</span> (not <span class="greekheb">ἴσθι</span>), “show thyself” throughout all degrees of trial and in any emergency. It is more than doubtful if this is a subtle local allusion to the loyalty and local patriotism upon which Sardis prided herself and which she had urged as her plea to Tiberius (Tacit. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> iv. 56). On the honours subsequently paid to martyrs in Smyrna, <span class="ital">cf. Mart.

It is unwise to make anything either mystical or rigidly literal out of the number ten, which here is probably a round number. The question is whether the round number denotes a small (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19</a>) or a large number (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-3.htm">Job 19:3</a>). The former seems probable. It is not impossible that some analogy between their case and that of the "four children" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12, 15</a>) is suggested by the ten days' probation. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou faithful unto death</span>; literally, <span class="accented">become thou faithful</span>; show thyself to be such (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Note how completely the angel of the Church is identified with the Church. In this one verse we have complete mixture of the two modes of address: "<span class="accented">Thou</span> art about to suffer...  some <span class="accented">of you</span>...  <span class="accented">ye</span> shall have...  I will give <span class="accented">thee."</span> "Unto death" does not merely mean "to thy life's end," but "even if fidelity involves death;" compare "becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The crown of life</span>. The Authorized Version, by ignoring the article ("a crown of life"), sadly detracts from the meaning. It is the well-known crown, the crown which is truly such, in contrast to earthly crowns, and perhaps with a special reference to the crowns given at Smyrna to the priests of Dionysus at the expiration of their year of office. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has been found in inscriptions at Smyrna in this connexion (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, where the same phrase occurs; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>). Excepting <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> (where we have <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the regular word for "crown" in the New Testament. "Of life" is the genitive of apposition; the life is the crown, just as in "the Word of life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>) the life is the Word. It is impossible to determine whether St. John has in his mind the crown of a king, of a victorious athlete, or of a triumphant warrior. The XII. Tables provided that he who had won a crown might have it placed on his head when his dead body was carried in the funeral procession. St. John, both at Rome and in the East, would have seen this ceremony, possibly in the case of a crowned priest at Smyrna. "The crown of life" would be the exact opposite of that. The narrative of the martyrdom of St. Polycarp draws to a close with these words: "Having by his <span class="accented">patience</span> vanquished the unjust ruler, and having thus received <span class="accented">the crown of immortality,"</span> etc. The writer seems to have had <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> in his mind. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Fear not (&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Lit., fear nothing.

The persecution of the Christians is thus traced to the direct agency of Satan, and not to the offended passions or prejudices of men. Trench observes: "There is nothing more remarkable in the records which have come down to us of the early persecutions, than the sense which the confessors and martyrs and those who afterwards narrate their sufferings and their triumphs entertain and utter, that these great fights of affliction through which they were called to pass, were the immediate work of the Devil."<p>Shall cast (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., rightly, is about to cast.<p>Prison (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-21.htm">Acts 5:21</a>.<p>May be tried (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Tempted.
