Whether in the household of the “angel” or not is at least doubtful. The sin alleged against her is the same for which the Nicolaitanes are condemned—fornication, and the eating of things sacrificed to idols. If the above view be right, the leader of the exorcists is a woman—regarded by her followers as a prophetess, as one with a real message from God; but viewed by the Lord of the churches as a very Jezebel, teaching and seducing the servants of God. For letting her alone, for being timid, paying too much deference to her spiritual pretensions, for failing to see and to show that the so-called “deep things” of these teachers were depths of Satan, the chief minister is rebuked. A large number of respectable critics regard Jezebel as a name applied to a faction, not as belonging to an individual. It seems best to view the name as symbolical, always remembering that the Jezebel spirit of proud, self-constituted authority, vaunting claims of superior holiness, or higher knowledge, linked with a disregard of—and perhaps a proud contempt for—“legalism,” and followed by open immorality, has again and again run riot in the churches of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols....">Revelation 2:20-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Notwithstanding, I have a few things, </span>&c. — Yet, observe, there are some things in thy conduct I take notice of, which deserve blame, and call for reformation, namely, <span class="ital">thou sufferest that woman Jezebel </span>— Thou givest too much countenance to some evil persons, who, like that wicked woman Jezebel, of old, who defiled Israel with her idolatrous and lewd practices, set themselves <span class="ital">to teach, and, </span>on wicked pretences of prophecy and revelation, <span class="ital">to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols </span>— Both which are contrary to the truth and purity of the doctrine and worship of my gospel.

Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee - Compare notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4</a>.<p>Because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel - Thou dost tolerate, or countenance her. Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>. Who the individual here referred to by the name Jezebel was, is not known. It is by no means probable that this was her real name, but seems to have been given to her as expressive of her character and influence. Jezebel was the wife of Ahab; a woman of vast influence over her husband - an influence which was uniformly exerted for evil. She was a daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre and Sidon, and lived about 918 years before Christ. She was an idolater, and induced her weak husband not only to connive at her introducing the worship of her native idols, but to become an idolater himself, and to use all the means in his power to establish the worship of idols instead of the worship of the true God. She was highly gifted, persuasive, and artful; was resolute in the accomplishment of her purposes; ambitious of extending and perpetuating her power, and unscrupulous in the means which she employed to execute her designs. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a> ff.<p>The kind of character, therefore, which would be designated by the term as used here, would be that of a woman who was artful and persuasive in her manner; who was capable of exerting a wide influence over others; who had talents of a high order; who was a thorough advocate of error; who was unscrupulous in the means which she employed for accomplishing her ends; and the tendency of whose influence was to lead the people into the abominable practices of idolatry. The opinions which she held, and the practices into which she led others, appear to have been the same which are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-6.htm">Revelation 2:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14-15</a> of this chapter. The difference was, that the teacher in this case was a woman - a circumstance which by no means lessened the enormity of the offence; for, besides the fact that it was contrary to the whole genius of Christianity that a woman should be a public teacher, there was a special incongruity that she should be an advocate of such abominable opinions and practices. Every sentiment of our nature makes us feel that it is right to expect that if a woman teaches at all in a public manner, she should inculcate only what is true and holy - she should be an advocate of a pure life. We are shocked; we feel that there is a violation of every principle of our nature, and an insult done to our common humanity, if it is otherwise. We have in a manner become accustomed to the fact that man should be a teacher of pollution and error, so that we do not shrink from it with horror; we never can be reconciled to the fact that a woman should.<p>Which calleth herself a prophetess - Many persons set up the claim to be prophets in the times when the gospel was first preached, and it is not improbable that many females would lay claim to such a character, after the example of Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, etc.<p>To teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>. Whether she herself practiced what she taught is not expressly affirmed, but seems to be implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-22.htm">Revelation 2:22</a>. It is not often that persons teach these doctrines without practicing what they teach; and the fact that they desire and design to live in this manner will commonly account for the fact that they inculcate such views.<p>And to eat things sacrificed unto idols - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>. The custom of attending on the festivals of idols led commonly to licentiousness, and they who were gross and sensual in their lives were fit subjects to be persuaded to attend on idol feasts - for nowhere else would they find more unlimited toleration for the indulgence of their passions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. a few things&#8212;omitted in the three oldest manuscripts. Translate then, "I have against thee that," &c.<p>sufferest&#8212;The three oldest manuscripts read, "lettest alone."<p>that woman&#8212;Two oldest manuscripts read, "THY wife"; two omit it. Vulgate and most ancient versions read as English Version. The symbolical Jezebel was to the Church of Thyatira what Jezebel, Ahab's "wife," was to him. Some self-styled prophetess (or as the feminine in Hebrew is often used collectively to express a multitude, a set of false prophets), as closely attached to the Church of Thyatira as a wife is to a husband, and as powerfully influencing for evil that Church as Jezebel did Ahab. As Balaam, in Israel's early history, so Jezebel, daughter of Eth-baal, king of Sidon (1Ki 16:31, formerly priest of Astarte, and murderer of his predecessor on the throne, Josephus [Against Apion, 1.18]), was the great seducer to idolatry in Israel's later history. Like her father, she was swift to shed blood. Wholly given to Baal worship, like Eth-baal, whose name expresses his idolatry, she, with her strong will, seduced the weak Ahab and Israel beyond the calf-worship (which was a worship of the true God under the cherub-ox form, that is, a violation of the second commandment) to that of Baal (a violation of the first commandment also). She seems to have been herself a priestess and prophetess of Baal. Compare 2Ki 9:22, 30, "whoredoms of &#8230; Jezebel and her witchcrafts" (impurity was part of the worship of the Phœnician Astarte, or Venus). Her spiritual counterpart at Thyatira lured God's "servants" by pretended utterances of inspiration to the same libertinism, fornication, and eating of idol-meats, as the Balaamites and Nicolaitanes (Re 2:6, 14, 15). By a false spiritualism these seducers led their victims into the grossest carnality, as though things done in the flesh were outside the true man, and were, therefore, indifferent. "The deeper the Church penetrated into heathenism, the more she herself became heathenish; this prepares us for the expressions 'harlot' and 'Babylon,' applied to her afterwards" [Auberlen].<p>to teach and to seduce&#8212;The three oldest manuscripts read, "and she teaches and seduces," or "deceives." "Thyatira was just the reverse of Ephesus. There, much zeal for orthodoxy, but little love; here, activity of faith and love, but insufficient zeal for godly discipline and doctrine, a patience of error even where there was not a participation in it" [Trench].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee: See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-4.htm" title="Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love.">Revelation 2:4</a>"</span>, <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel:</span> the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-6.htm" title="But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.">Revelation 2:6</a>,15</span>, is so plainly expressed in the latter part of the verse, viz. maintaining the lawfulness of eating things offered to idols, and of fornication; that whosoever this woman was, it is plain she was one of that filthy sect.

But what she was cannot be determined; for though we allow this church to be typical of the church in the times of popery, and the popish synagogue, which maintaineth both these things to be the antitype; yet certainly there was some famous heretical strumpet in this church, which the governors did not restrain and cast out of their communion; which is the thing Christ had against this church, and the officers in it, who ought to have restrained her extravagancies both in teaching such doctrines, (being contrary to the apostle’s doctrine in the places before mentioned), and from teaching at all, being no prophetess though she pretended to it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee,.... By way of complaint; so the Arabic version renders it, "I have a certain complaint against thee". The impartiality of Christ may be observed in taking notice of the bad deeds, as well as of the good ones of his people, and his tenderness in representing them as few; and these things he had against them not in a judicial way to their condemnation, but in a providential way, in order to chastise them for them, for their good; and they are as follow: <p>because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel; or "thy wife Jezebel", as the Complutensian edition and Syriac version read; the name of King Ahab's wife, who seduced him, in the Hebrew language is "Izebel", but is read by the Septuagint in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>, Jezebel, as here; and by Josephus (a) Jezabela; she had her name from  "Zebel", "dung", to which Elijah has reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a>; the Ethiopic version calls her "Elzabel". By her is meant the apostate church of Rome, comparable to Jezebel, the wife of Ahab; as she was the daughter of an Heathen, so is Rome Papal the daughter of Rome Pagan; and as she was the wife of Ahab, and therefore a queen, so the whore of Babylon calls herself; and as Jezebel was famous for her paintings, so the church of Rome for her pretensions to religion and holiness, and for the gaudiness of her worship; and as she was remarkable for her idolatry, whoredoms, witchcrafts, and cruel persecution of the prophets of the Lord, and for murder, and innocent blood she shed; so the church of Rome, for her idolatrous worship of images, for her whoredoms, both in a literal and spiritual sense, and for the witchcrafts, magic, and devilish arts many of her popes have been addicted to, and especially for her barbarities and cruelties exercised upon the true professors of Christ, and for the blood of the martyrs, with which she has been drunk; and as Jezebel stirred up Ahab against good and faithful men, is has this church stirred up the secular powers, emperors, kings, and princes, against the true followers of Christ: and the end of both of them is much alike; as scarce anything was left of Jezebel, so Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, shall be cast into the sea, and be found no more at all: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-7.htm">2 Kings 9:7</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>, <p>which calleth herself a prophetess; as perhaps Jezebel might do, since she was such a favourer of the prophets of Baal, and so familiarly conversed with them, and kept them, even a hundred of them, at her table: and certain it is, that the antitype of her pretends to an infallible interpretation of the Scriptures, and to have a bulk of unwritten traditions; and which interpretations and traditions are to be regarded as an infallible rule of faith and practice. Now what is complained of in the true members and followers of Christ is, that they suffered this woman <p>to teach; when it was insufferable for a woman to teach, and especially such a strumpet: <p>and to seduce my servants to commit fornication; to deceive such who called themselves the servants of Christ, and draw them into the commission of spiritual fornication, which is idolatry; as the idolatrous worship of the Mass, and of images and saints departed: <p>and to eat things sacrificed unto idols; as Balaam, or the pope, before had done, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>.

If now “the woman Jez.” collectively is to designate a party and “personified heresy,”[1234] the body of Jews, the synagogue,[1235] cannot be meant,—an explanation which only by the most unnatural artificialness is united with the declaration that the false doctrine of Jezebel alludes to <span class="greekheb">πορνεῦσαι</span> and <span class="greekheb">φαγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰδωλ</span>.,—but the Nicolaitan false teachers must be represented under the figure of Jezebel.[1236] But partly the designation <span class="greekheb">τὴν γυναῖκα</span>, which is attached to a name sufficient for that sense, partly the further limitation <span class="greekheb">ἡ λεγουσα έαυτ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., which has in itself something that is individual, decides the view that a particular woman is meant; not the wife of a bishop,[1237] nor a woman who is actually called Jezebel,[1238] but some woman who under the pretence of being a prophetess had approved the doctrines of the Nicolaitans, and for that reason was designated a new Jezebel, as Ahab’s wife formerly in the O. T. church, by the introduction of the worship of Baal, and fornication,[1239] which was combined with the worship of Baal and Ashtaroth, gave the greatest offence.[1240] That the woman in Thyatira did not actually have the name Jezebel, but rather that this name was understood symbolically, does not follow from the fact that in the Apoc. all names except that of the composer are of a symbolical character,[1241] for that is not the case;[1242] but from the fact that it is applied to the false doctrines and godlessness, which have been designated already by the name of Balaam, of entirely similar notoriety with that of the wife of Ahab.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1223] On this form, Winer, p. 77.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1224] <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-44.htm" title="And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin.

This “Jezebel of a woman, alleging herself to be a prophetess,” seems to have been some influential female (as the definite imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-21.htm" title="And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not....">Revelation 2:21-23</a> indicates); her lax principles or tendencies made for a connexion with foreign and compromising associations which evidently exerted a dangerous charm upon some weaker Christians in the city. The moral issue corresponds to that produced by the Nikolaitan party at Pergamos (<span class="greekheb">εἰδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φαγεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">πορνεῦσαι</span>), but the serious nature of the heresy at Thyatira appears from the fact that it was not simply propagated within the church but also notorious (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm" title="And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.">Revelation 2:23</a>) and long-continued (<span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span>), thanks to obstinacy among the Ahabs and adherents of this prominent woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-21.htm" title="And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.">Revelation 2:21</a>). They prided themselves on their enlightened liberalism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-24.htm" title="But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put on you none other burden.">Revelation 2:24</a>). The definiteness of her personality, the fact of her situation within a Christian church which had jurisdiction over her, and the association of her practices with those of the Nikolaitans, who were members of the church, render it impossible to identify this libertine influence of Jude with a foreign institution such as the famous shrine of the Chaldean Sibyl at Thyatira (Schürer: <span class="ital">Theol. Abhandlungen</span>, pp. 39 f., a theory suggested by Blakesley, in Smith’s <span class="ital">DB</span>), or with the wife of the local Asiarch (Selwyn, 123). Besides it was not the cults but the trade-guilds that formed the problem at Thyatira. Jastrow points out (p. 267) that for some occult reason female sorcerers were preferred to men among the Babylonians; “the witch appears more frequently than the male sorcerer”. Hillel (Pirke Aboth, ii. 8; see Dr. C. Taylor’s note) had already declared, “more women, more witchcraft”. For the connexion of women and sorcery <span class="ital">cf.</span> Blau’s <span class="ital">Altjüd. Zauberwesen</span> 18 f., 23 f.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ λέγουσα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., an irregular nomin. absolute, characteristic of the writer. This LXX peculiarity of a detached participle thrown into relief, which is not confined to the Apocalypse (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing....">Php 3:16-19</a>, etc.), renders the participle almost a relative (Vit. i., 202); but indeed any word or group of words, thus singled out as characteristic of some preceding noun, tends to become independent and to take its own construction (II. 8f). See <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.">Zephaniah 1:12</a> (LXX).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[903].

If the sense “thy wife Jezebel” be right, the allusion must be to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-25.htm" title="But there was none like to Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.">1 Kings 21:25</a> : there is some one (or something) at Thyatira who is, to the Angel of the Church, such a temptress as Jezebel was to Ahab. No doubt, if we suppose the Angel to be the Bishop, it is probable that his actual wife is intended; but even then the name Jezebel must have this meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As a plain matter of verbal exegesis, “thy wife Jezebel” seems, in this context, the more natural translation. But it has its own difficulties. What analogy is there between a faithful servant of Christ, culpably tolerant of a bad wife, but not sharing her faults himself, and Ahab, who “did sell himself to work wickedness,” and “did very abominably in following idols?” It may be added, that except in Jehu’s taunt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?">2 Kings 9:22</a>), which need not be meant literally, there is no evidence whatever of Jezebel’s unchastity: her behaviour towards her husband, as well as her influence over him, makes it probable that she was a good wife, in her own way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the whole, the best editors decline to adopt the reading which would make the sense “thy wife” certain: and this being so, it seems better to translate as the A.

In such places the shorter reading is almost always genuine. See App. Crit. Ed. ii. on this passage. In the 19th verse the comparative <span class="greekheb">πλείονα</span> prefers the last works to the first, but it is not opposed to <span class="greekheb">ὀλίγα</span>.

Ant. in the notes of Ducæus, quotes <span class="greekheb">ἀφεῖς</span>, Exodus 32; and in the Apocalypse it is supported by the agreement of all the MSS.,[38] if you except the silence of one or two which are more carelessly collated. Comp. Marck. on Ap. ii. § 46, 53. From <span class="greekheb">ἕω</span> (Ion. <span class="greekheb">ἕημι</span>, in the common dialects <span class="greekheb">ἵημι</span>) is formed <span class="greekheb">ἀφέω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀφέεις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀφέει</span>, although <span class="greekheb">ἀφεῖς</span> only, and that contracted, is in use. However it is, there was no reason why John himself should not write <span class="greekheb">ἀφεῖς</span>, equally with the Greek copyists, the meaning being free from doubt. <span class="ital">Arethas</span>, who substitutes <span class="greekheb">ἀφίης</span>, in other places used Greek forms better than those employed by John, as they appeared to himself to be suitable. See below on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-13.htm" title="And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.">Revelation 16:13</a>. The same reasoning applies to the following words,[39] as far as relates to the MSS., <span class="greekheb">καὶ διδάσκει καὶ πλανᾷ</span>, the meaning of which also is obvious. For first the verb <span class="greekheb">ἀφίημι</span> is also put absolutely in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-15.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness.

This is certainly fight. "A few things" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) is an insertion in some inferior authorities. Others insert "many things" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>); the Sinaitic inserts "much" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;</span>); while the best authorities have nothing between <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>; and then <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> must be rendered "that" rather than "because." The construction is the same as in ver. 4. There is a right and a wrong suffering; and the Church in Thyatira exhibits both. The enduring of tribulation (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) is commended; the toleration of evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) is rebuked. It is not said that Jezebel receives sympathy or encouragement, but merely that she is let alone; her wickedness is left unchecked, and that is sinful. For this use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-7.htm">John 12:7</a>. It is difficult to decide between "the woman" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) and "thy wife" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), authorities being much divided; the balance seems in favour of the former. But even if "thy wife" be preferred, there is no need to understand Jezebel as indicating a distinct person. We are in the region of figures and metaphors. Perhaps all that is indicated is that the angel of the Church at Thyatira is suffering from the tolerated presence of a baneful influence, as did Ahab, "whom <span class="accented">Jezebel his wife</span> stirred up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>). And if it is not certain that any individual false prophetess is signified, it is scarcely worth while to speculate as to who this individual is. Jezebel may be a person, or she may be a form of false doctrine personified. If the former, Jezebel is doubtless not her real name, but a symbolical name of reproach, and what her name and status were we have no means of knowing. In any case the error represented by the name is closely akin to that of the Nicolaitans and to "the doctrine of Balaam." Whatever differences of detail there may have been, all three made Christian liberty a plea for an antichristian licence which claimed to be above the moral Law. And she teacheth and seduceth. This is an independent statement, and must not, as in the Authorized Version, be made to depend upon "thou sufferest." For the construction <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, compare <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). The word for "seduce," or "lead astray" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>), in the active is frequent in St. John, especially in Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a> 13:14; 19:20; 20:3, 8, 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). A comparison of these passages will lead to the conclusion that the word implies seduction into error of a very grave kind. It is not clear whether "fornication" is to be understood literally, or, as often in the Old Testament, in the spiritual sense of idolatry. The former seems more probable. "My servants" means all Christians, as is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a> and Revelation 22:3; it must not be limited to those in authority in the Church.

She was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Sidon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>), formerly a priest of Astarte, and who had made his way to the throne by the murder of his predecessor Pheles. Ahab's marriage with her was the first instance of a marriage with a heathen princess of a king of the northern kingdom of Israel. This alliance was a turning-point in the moral history of the kingdom. From the times of David and Solomon many treaties had been concluded between Phoenicia and Israel; but it was at the same time the special business of the kingdom of the ten tribes to restore the ancient rigidness of the nationality of Israel. Jezebel looked down with perverse pride upon a people whose religion she neither understood nor respected. Though the ten tribes had yielded to idolatry in the worship of the calves, the true God was still worshipped and the law of Moses acknowledged. From the time of Ahab's marriage the apostasy of Israel became more decided and deadly. She was "a woman in whom, with the reckless and licentious habits of an Oriental queen, were united the fiercest and sternest qualities inherent in the old Semitic race. Her husband, in whom generous and gentle feelings were not wanting, was yet of a weak and yielding character which soon made him a tool in her hands.... The wild license of her life and the magical fascination of her arts or her character became a proverb in the nation. Round her and from her, in different degrees of nearness, is evolved the awful drama of the most eventful crisis of this portion of the Israelite history" (Stanley, "Jewish Church"). She sought to exterminate the prophets of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>), and inaugurated the worship of Baal the Sun-God on a magnificent scale. Two sanctuaries were established, one for each of the great Phoenician deities, at each of the two new capitals of the kingdom, Samaria and Jezreel. The sanctuary of Astarte or Ashtaroth (the Phoenician Venus) at Jezreel was under Jezebel's special sanction, and there is reason to suppose that she ministered as a priestess in that licentious worship. Four hundred priests or prophets were attached to this sanctuary and were supported at her table. The sanctuary to Baal at Samaria was large enough to contain all the worshippers of the northern kingdom. Its staff consisted of four hundred and fifty priests, and the interior contained representations of the Sun-God on small pillars, while a large statue of the same deity was set up in front. At these sanctuaries Ahab in person offered sacrifices.<p>Expositors are divided as to the symbolic import of the name in this passage, some referring it to a single person - "some single wicked woman in the Church of Thyatira inheriting this name of infamy in the Church of God," giving herself out as a prophetess, and seducing the servants of Christ to commit fornication and to eat things offered to idols. Others interpret the name as designating an influential heretical party in the Church: but, as Alford remarks, "the real solution must lie hidden until all that is hidden shall be known." It is clear, at any rate, that Thyatira, like the Church of old, had sinned by her alliance with a corrupt faith and practice.<p>To teach and to seduce (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>The best texts read &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; and she teacheth and seduceth. So Rev. For seduceth see on err, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-24.htm">Mark 12:24</a>, and see on deceiver and error, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-64.htm">Matthew 27:64</a>. The word &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; to seduce is found oftener in Revelation than elsewhere in the New Testament. It never means mere error as such, but fundamental departure from the truth.<p>To commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols<p>Both sins of the historical Jezebel.
