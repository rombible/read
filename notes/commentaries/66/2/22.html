Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, I will cast her into a bed - Not into a bed of ease, but a bed of pain. There is evidently a purpose to contrast this with her former condition. The harlot's bed and a sick-bed are thus brought together, as they are often, in fact, in the dispensations of Providence and the righteous judgments of God. One cannot be indulged without leading on, sooner or later, to the horrid sufferings of the other: and how soon no one knows.<p>And them that commit adultery with her - Those who are seduced by her doctrines into this sin; either they who commit it with her literally, or who are led into the same kind of life.<p>Into great tribulation - Great suffering; disease of body or tortures of the soul. How often - how almost uniformly is this the case with those who thus live! Sooner or later, sorrow always comes upon the licentious; and God has evinced by some of his severest judgments, in forms of frightful disease, his displeasure at the violation of the laws of purity. There is no sin that produces a mere withering and desolating effect upon the soul than what is here referred to; none which is more certain to be followed with sorrow.<p>Except they repent of their deeds - It is only by repentance that we can avoid the consequences of sin.

Of sickness and languishing; and which denotes the sickly, pining, and languishing state of the church of Rome, as a just retaliation for her bed of luxury and deliciousness, adultery and idolatry, she had indulged herself in; this was threatened, and was yet to come, and began at the time of the Reformation, signified by the next church state; and, ever since, the whore of Rome has been visibly sickening and decaying. The Alexandrian copy reads, "into a prison": <p>and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation: the kings of the earth, and their subjects, who have joined in the idolatries and corruptions of the Romish church, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>, which may be understood either of that distress and uneasiness the Reformation in some countries gave them; or those outward troubles, wars, and desolations they have been since attended with, particularly the empire of Germany; which has been in great tribulation, formerly by the Turks, and of late by internal broils among themselves, and by the armies of other princes entering into it; or it may regard that eternal vengeance that will be recompensed to all such persons: <p>except they repent of their deeds; their spiritual fornication or idolatry, and all the abominations the members of that apostate church are guilty of. There seems to be an allusion in this verse to Ahaziah and Joram, sons of Ahab and Jezebel, who followed their mother's idolatrous practices, and were cast upon a bed of sickness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/2-22.htm" title="Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds....">Revelation 2:22-23</a>. The <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span> so strongly emphasizes the succeeding threat, and makes us so to expect something new in comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-21.htm" title="And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.">Revelation 2:21</a>, that the discredited <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span> appears in an exegetical respect entirely superfluous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Already the <span class="greekheb">βάλλω αὐτ</span>. shows that the <span class="greekheb">κλίνη</span> is a bed which the woman takes only when so compelled. Yet the <span class="greekheb">κλίνη</span> does not designate the punishments in hell,[1251] but the sick-bed,[1252] in opposition to the bed of sensuality. But by this description of such judgment, the reference to Jezebel and her entirely different[1253] punishment is abandoned,[1254] so that even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm" title="And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.">Revelation 2:23</a>, in the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΤΈΚΝΑ ΑὐΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, an allusion to the destruction of the sons of Ahab[1255] dare not be sought. The punishment of the woman and her companions, without regard to the significant designation existing in the name Jezebel, is determined in accordance with the manner of their sins. It is to be observed, however, that the expression now chosen, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΟΙΧΕΎΕΙΝ</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΜΟΙΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΜΕΤʼ ΑὐΤῆς</span></span></span>, i.e., those who shared in her deeds,[1256] designates the entire conduct of the woman and her party in a double sense, embracing the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΝΕΊΑ</span></span></span> and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΑΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΕἸΔΩΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, since the ethnicizing disorder must be punished more than adultery in a theocratical-symbolical sense, as in fact actual fornication was what was chiefly designed. Thus the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΟΙΧΕΎΟΝΤΕς ΜΕΤʼ ἈΥΤῆς</span></span></span> are those who perform <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ἜΡΓΑ ΑὐΤῆς</span></span></span>, i.e., the works taught and practised by the woman; or as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm" title="And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.">Revelation 2:23</a> it is again said, according to another application of the symbolical idea,[1257] <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΤΈΚΝΑ ΑὐΤῆς</span></span></span>,[1258] and therefore not actually bastards.[1259] Incorrectly, N. de Lyra: gehenna. It is possible to think of a pest,[1260] because the LXX. have rendered the Heb. <span class="greekheb">דֶּבֶר</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-27.htm" title="Say you thus to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.">Ezekiel 33:27</a>, by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΆΝΑΤΟς</span></span></span>. Meanwhile it is sufficient to leave the matter in its universality; the entire formula <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΤ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΝ ΘΑΝΆΤῼ</span></span></span> then in its fulness corresponds in some measure to the Hebrew mode of combining an infin. with the finite tense of its root, as, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a>, where the punishment of adultery is stated <span class="greekheb">מות־יומַת</span> (LXX., <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΑΝἈΤῷ ΘΑΝΑΤΟΎς ΘΩΣΑΝ</span></span></span>). But any allusion to this precise passage is, to say the least, doubtful. The independence of the Johannean formula, notwithstanding its adoption, of Hebraic modes of statement, lies partly in the distinction between the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΤΕΝῶ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΑΝἈΤῷ</span></span></span>, and partly in the fact that by the addition of the preposition <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> the precise idea of the means[1261] is marked.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΓΝΏΣΟΝΤΑΙ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> Every judgment of the Lord upon the world is a revelation of his glory, and has the intentional result to advance and strengthen believers more and more in their knowledge. Thus the idea of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΝΩΣ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is entirely too general[1262] to admit of any special opposition to the false gnosis[1263] of the Nicolaitans. It is different with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-24.htm" title="But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put on you none other burden.">Revelation 2:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠᾶΣΑΙ ΑΊ ἘΚΚΛ</span></span></span>.

It is one of the many differences between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse, that in the former <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> is the dominant form, while in the latter <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> is the invariable form (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>:l, 5, 7 is a spurious addition); <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> is very rare in the Gospel; <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span> is found nowhere in the Apocalypse. In the Epistles neither form occurs. <span class="cmt_word">I do cast her into a bed</span>. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>, is the true reading; the future has been substituted for the present to match the futures in ver. 23. Forbearance having failed, God tries severity; and, as so often in his dealings with man, the instrument of wrong doing is made the instrument of punishment. The bed of sin becomes a bed of suffering. Compare "In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine;" and "I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is one of many words which has become weakened in meaning in late Greek: it often means no more than "place" or "put" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-7.htm">John 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>). In the passive it is rather common of being <span class="accented">laid up</span> in sickness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-6.htm">Matthew 8:6, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-30.htm">Mark 7:30</a>). But perhaps we should rather compare such expressions as "cast into prison, into the sea, into the fire, into Gehenna" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-30.htm">Matthew 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8, 9</a>). It may be doubted whether there is any significance in the fact that her sin is spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 21), whereas those who sin with her are said <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Idolatry is spoken of both as whoredom and as adultery. In the one case it is a <span class="accented">contrast to</span> the marriage tie between God and his faithful worshippers; in the other it is a <span class="accented">violation</span> of it. Jezebel anticipates the harlot of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, as Balaam anticipates the false prophet of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. The remarkable construction, "repent <span class="accented">out of"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>), is peculiar to this book (vers. 21, 22; 9:20, 21; 16:11; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm">Acts 8:22</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm">Hebrews 6:1</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span> (compare the converse, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>). <span class="accented">"Her</span> works" is to be preferred to "their works." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> might easily be changed to <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, either accidentally, owing to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or deliberately, because it seems strange to talk of repenting from the works of another person. But the point is that those who have become partakers in her sins have abandoned their own works for hers; and it is therefore from her works that they are bidden to repent (compare "my works" in ver. 26). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Into a bed<p>Of anguish.
