Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron - There is an allusion here to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>; "Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." There is a slight change in the passage, "he shall rule," instead of "thou shalt break," in order to adapt the language to the purpose of the speaker here. The allusion in the Psalm is to the Messiah as reigning triumphant over the nations, or subduing them under him; and the idea here, as in the previous verse, is, that his redeemed people will be associated with him in this dominion. To rule with a scepter of iron, is not to rule with a harsh and tyrannical sway, but with power that is firm and invincible. It denotes a government of strength, or one that cannot be successfully opposed; one in which the subjects are effectually subdued.<p>As the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers - The ironic here is that of the vessel of a potter - a fragile vessel of clay - struck with a rod of iron and broken into fragments. That is, as applied to the nations, there would be no power to oppose His rule; the enemies of his government would be destroyed. Instead of remaining firm and compacted together, they would be broken like the clay vessel of a potter when struck with a rod of iron. The speaker does not intimate when this would be; but all that is said here would be applicable to that time when the Son of God will come to judge the world, and when His saints will be associated with him in his triumphs. As, in respect to all the others of the seven epistles to the churches, the rewards promised refer to heaven, and to the happy state of that blessed world, it would seem also that this should have a similar reference, for there is no reason why "to him that overcame" in Thyatira a temporal reward and triumph should be promised more than in the cases of the others. If so, then this passage should not be adduced as having any reference to an imaginary personal reign of the Saviour and of the saints on the earth.<p>Even as I received of my Father - As he has appointed me, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6-9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. From Ps 2:8, 9.<p>rule&#8212;literally, "rule as a shepherd." In Ps 2:9 it is, "Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron." The Septuagint, pointing the Hebrew word differently, read as Revelation here. The English Version of Ps 2:9 is doubtless right, as the parallel word, "dash in pieces," proves. But the Spirit in this case sanctions the additional thought as true, that the Lord shall mingle mercy to some, with judgment on others; beginning by destroying His Antichristian foes, He shall reign in love over the rest. "Christ shall rule them with a scepter of iron, to make them capable of being ruled with a scepter of gold; severity first, that grace may come after" (Trench, who thinks we ought to translate "SCEPTER" for "rod," as in Heb 1:8). "Shepherd" is used in Jer 6:3, of hostile rulers; so also in Zec 11:16. As severity here is the primary thought, "rule as a shepherd" seems to me to be used thus: He who would have shepherded them with a pastoral rod, shall, because of their hardened unbelief, shepherd them with a rod of iron.<p>shall they be broken&#8212;So one oldest manuscript, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic Versions read. But two oldest manuscripts, read, "as the vessels of a potter are broken to shivers." A potter's vessel dashed to pieces, because of its failing to answer the design of the maker, is the image to depict God's sovereign power to give reprobates to destruction, not by caprice, but in the exercise of His righteous judgment. The saints shall be in Christ's victorious "armies" when He shall inflict the last decisive blow, and afterwards shall reign with Him. Having by faith "overcome the world," they shall also rule the world.<p>even as I&#8212;"as I also have received of (from) My Father," namely, in Ps 2:7-9. Jesus had refused to receive the kingdom without the cross at Satan's hands; He would receive it from none but the Father, who had appointed the cross as the path to the crown. As the Father has given the authority to Me over the heathen and uttermost parts of the earth, so I impart a share of it to My victorious disciple.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And he shall rule them with a rod of iron:</span> an iron rod either signifies a right rod, that will not be easily bent and made crooked; or a severe rod, which is most probably the sense: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm" title="For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, said the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffs at him.">Psalm 12:5</a></span>.

Either with the Gospel, which is the rod of Christ's strength, and is the power of God unto salvation, and by which the kingdom of Christ is enlarged, and the power of the church of Christ over the antichristian party is increased; or it may design great strictness and severity, with which the man of sin will be used by the saints of the most High, when they shall take away his dominion from him: <p>as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers; which may be expressive either of the breaking of rocky hearts in pieces at conversion, and of making souls humble and contrite; or of the irreparable ruin and destruction of antichrist, when the saints shall consume and destroy him: <p>even as I received of my Father; Christ, as God, has an underived power and government; but, as Mediator, his rule and power over the nations are asked by him, given to him, and received by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>. This "as" does not intend equality, but similitude; and denotes the participation the saints will have with Christ in the judgment and destruction of antichrist, and in his kingdom and power. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{22}</span> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</span><p>(22) The brightness of greatest glory and honour nearest approaching to the light of Christ, who is the Son of righteousness, and our head; Mt 4:14,16.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">shall rule them</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">shall be their shepherd</span>.

Amen....">Revelation 1:6-7</a>): so from this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-5.htm" title="And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.">Revelation 12:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm" title="And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.">Revelation 19:15</a> we see that he accepted “rule” as the right reading. Apart from this, shepherd is used in the Old Testament of human and superhuman rulers often enough to suggest its use here. The same metaphor is found in Classical Greek.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall they be broken</span>] Read, <span class="bld">are broken</span>: he is to rule the nations with as absolute a mastery as is expressed in crushing a potsherd.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even as I</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">as I also</span>. Of course the meaning is, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a> is assumed to be the promise of the Father to the Son; as is plain from the eighth verse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/revelation/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-27.htm" title="And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.">Revelation 2:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ποιμανεῖ</span>) In the Hebrew it is <span class="greekheb">תרועם</span>, Thou shalt break them in pieces, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a>, from <span class="greekheb">רעע </span>he broke in pieces, the verb of cognate meaning following, <span class="greekheb">תנפצם </span>Thou shalt scatter them, <span class="greekheb">συντρίψεις αὐτούς</span>. The Septuagint, as though they had read in the former passage <span class="greekheb">תרעם </span>from <span class="greekheb">רעה </span>he fed, have rendered it <span class="greekheb">ποιμανεῖς</span> (Thou shalt feed). The Apocalypse, not through imitation of the Septuagint translators, but on its own authority, uses that word, which is peculiarly appropriate. And in other places, when it refers to ancient prophecy, it most befittingly preserves the peculiarity of the Hebrew text: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm" title="For the Lamb which is in the middle of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.">Revelation 7:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-4.htm" title="These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.">Revelation 11:4</a>.[44]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[44] <span class="greekheb">παρὰ τοῦ Πατρός μον</span>, <span class="ital">from My Father</span>) Jesus, when He was living on the earth, somewhat more frequently said, <span class="ital">My Father which is in heaven</span>; but now, simply, <span class="ital">My Father</span>; for He Himself is set <span class="ital">in the heaven</span> with His Father—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - The verse is not a parenthesis. <span class="cmt_word">He shall rule them</span>. Here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>; and in Revelation 19:15, the LXX. rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> is adopted; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "Thou shalt <span class="accented">rule</span> them," or more literally, "shalt <span class="accented">shepherd</span> them," instead of "shalt <span class="accented">break</span> them," which almost certainly is the meaning of the Hebrew. The Hebrew original, <span class="accented">trhm</span> without vowel points, may represent either <span class="accented">tirhem</span> or <span class="accented">terohem</span>; but the latter is required by what follows; "shalt dash them in pieces." Nevertheless, the gentler rendering better suits the requirements of these passages in the Apocalypse. The rule over the nations is to be strong, but it is to be loving also. To those who obey it, it will be a shepherding; only those who resist it will be dashed in pieces. Precisely the same expression is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> of the Lamb shepherding his saints, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm">John 21:16</a> in the charge to St. Peter to shepherd Christ's sheep. It is not easy to determine whether the "rod" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f00;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;</span>) is a king's sceptre, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>, or a shepherd's staff, as m <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-7.htm">Zechariah 11:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">As the vessels of pottery are broken to shivers</span>.
