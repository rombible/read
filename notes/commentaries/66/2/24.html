Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira - The word - "and" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  kai - is omitted in many mss. and versions, and in the critical editions of Griesbach, Tittmann, and Hahn, and the connection demands that it should be omitted. As it stands in the received text, it would seem that what he here says was addressed to those who had received that doctrine, and to all others as well as to them; whereas the declaration here made pertains manifestly to those who had not received the doctrine. With that particle omitted the passage will read, as rendered by Prof. Stuart, "But I say unto you, the remainder in Thyatira, so many as hold not this doctrine," etc. That is, he addresses now all the members of the church who were not involved in the charges already made. He does not say how large a portion of the church had escaped the contaminating influence of those opinions, but to that portion, whether great or small, he addresses only words of exhortation and comfort.<p>As many as have not this doctrine - To all who have not embraced it, or been contaminated with it. It may be presumed that there was a considerable portion of the church which had not.<p>And which have not known the depths of Satan - The deep art and designs of Satan. Deep things are those which are hidden from view - as of things which are far underground; and hence the word is used to denote mysteries, or profound designs and purposes. The allusion here is not to any trials or sufferings that Satan might bring upon anyone, or to any temptations of which he might be the author, but to his profound art in inculcating error and leading people astray. There are doctrines of error, and arguments for sin, to originate which seems to lie beyond the power of people, and which would appear almost to have exhausted the talent of Satan himself. They evince such a profound knowledge of man; of the divine government; of the course of events on earth; and of what our race needs; and they are defended with so much eloquence, skill, learning, and subtlety of argumentation, that they appear to lie beyond the compass of the human powers.<p>As they speak - This cannot mean that the defenders of these errors themselves called their doctrines "the depths of Satan," for no teachers would choose so to designate their opinions; but it must mean, either that they who were opposed to those errors characterized them as "the depths of Satan," or that they who opposed them said that they had not known "the depths of Satan." Prof. Stuart understands it in the latter sense. A somewhat more natural interpretation, it seems to me, however, is to refer it to what the opposers of these heretics said of these errors. They called them "the depths of Satan," and they professed not to have known anything of them. The meaning, perhaps, would be expressed by the familiar words, "as they say," or "as they call them," in the following manner: "As many as have not known the depths of Satan, as they say," or, "to use their own language." Doddridge paraphrases it, "as they proverbially speak." Tyndale encloses it in a parenthesis.<p>I will put upon you none other burden - That is, no other than that which you now experience from having these persons with you, and that which must attend the effort to purify the church. He had not approved their conduct for suffering these persons to remain in the church, and he threatens to punish all those who had become contaminated with these pernicious doctrines. He evidently designed to say that there was some token of his displeasure proper in the case, but he was not disposed to bring upon them any other expression of his displeasure than what grew naturally and necessarily out of the fact that they had been tolerated among them, and those troubles and toils which must attend the effort to deliver the church from these errors. Under any circumstances the church must suffer. It would suffer in reputation. It would suffer in respect to its internal tranquility. Perhaps, also, there were those who were implicated in these errors, and who would be implicated in the punishment, who had friends and kindred in the church; and the judgments which were to come upon the advocates of these errors must, therefore, come in a measure upon the church.<p>A kind Saviour says, that he would bring upon them no other and no weightier burden, than must arise from his purpose to inflict appropriate vengeance on the guilty themselves. The trouble which would grow out of that would be a sufficient expression of his displeasure. This is, in fact, often now all that is necessary as a punishment on a church for harboring the advocates of error and of sin. The church has trouble enough ultimately in getting rid of them; and the injury which such persons do to its piety, peace, and reputation, and the disorders of which they are the cause, constitute a sufficient punishment for having tolerated them in its bosom. Often the most severe punishment that God can bring upon people is to "lay upon them no other burden" than to leave them to the inevitable consequences of their own folly, or to the trouble and vexation incident to the effort to free themselves from what they had for a long time tolerated or practiced. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. you &#8230; and &#8230; the rest&#8212;The three oldest manuscripts omit "and"; translate then, "Unto you, the rest."<p>as many as have not&#8212;not only do not hold, but are free from contact with.<p>and which&#8212;The oldest manuscripts omit "and"; translate, "whosoever."<p>the depths&#8212;These false prophets boasted peculiarly of their knowledge of mysteries and the deep things of God; pretensions subsequently expressed by their arrogant title, Gnostics ("full of knowledge"). The Spirit here declares their so-called "depths," (namely, of knowledge of divine things) to be really "depths of Satan"; just as in Re 2:9, He says, instead of "the synagogue of God," "the synagogue of Satan." Hengstenberg thinks the teachers themselves professed to fathom the depths of Satan, giving loose rein to fleshly lusts, without being hurt thereby. They who thus think to fight Satan with his own weapons always find him more than a match for them. The words, "as they speak," that is, "as they call them," coming after not only "depths," but "depths of Satan," seem to favor this latter view; otherwise I should prefer the former, in which case, "as they speak," or "call them," must refer to "depths" only, not also "depths of Satan." The original sin of Adam was a desire to know EVIL as well as good, so in Hengstenberg's view, those who professed to know "the depths of Satan." It is the prerogative of God alone to know evil fully, without being hurt or defiled by it.<p>I will put&#8212;Two oldest manuscripts have "I put," or "cast."

Exaggerating and perfecting Paul's doctrine of grace without the law as the source of justification and sanctification, these false prophets rejected the law as a rule of life, as though it were an intolerable "burden." But it is a "light" burden. In Ac 15:28, 29, the very term "burden," as here, is used of abstinence from fornication and idol-meats; to this the Lord here refers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But unto you I say; </span> you that are the ministers, for they are distinguished from the rest in Thyatira.

The reference to the so-called gnosis of the Nicolaitans is here clearly indicated by the expression <span class="greekheb">τὰ βαθέα</span>, even apart from the controverted formula <span class="greekheb">ὡς λέγουσιν</span>; for to become acquainted with the depths (of divinity) was an essential pretence of the Gnostics.[1269] But it is a matter of controversy, whether the expression <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βαθέα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σατ</span>. should be conceived of as a self-chosen designation of Gnostic erroneous doctrine concerning the “rest,”[1270] so that <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνωσαν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὡς λέγουσιν</span> have the same subject, or whether the Nicolaitan Gnostics are to be regarded as the subject to <span class="greekheb">ὡς λέγουσιν</span>, so that the expression <span class="greekheb">τὰ βαθέα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σατ</span>. is used either entirely as it sounds in the sense of these Gnostics,[1271] or according to the analogy of the designation <span class="greekheb">συναγωγὴ τοῦ σατανᾶ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-9.htm" title="I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.">Revelation 2:9</a>, as a sarcastic transformation of the Gnostic expression concerning the depths; viz., as they say, of the Deity, but as it is rather in fact meant, of Satan.[1272] But if, in the former sense, the entire formula <span class="greekheb">τὰ βαθέα τοῦ σατανᾶ</span> were to be understood as one in itself peculiar to the Gnostics (<span class="greekheb">ὡς κεγ</span>.), it must also be shown how it was used by them; but this does not occur. Hence the view commends itself, that the expression <span class="greekheb">τὰ βαθέα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σατ</span>. is to be conceived of from the Christian standpoint. At the same time it appears far more forcible if the Gnostics themselves be regarded as the subject to <span class="greekheb">ὡς λέγουσιν</span> with respect to the chief idea <span class="greekheb">τὰ βαθέα</span>, while the further determination of <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σατανᾶ</span> is made prominent, in that the question in fact is not concerning divine depths,[1273] nor divine mysteries,[1274] but the depths of Satan, as if this judgment were put in the mouths of believers at Thyatira who remained faithful, and they therefore are regarded as the subject to the <span class="greekheb">ὡς λέγουσιν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To the rest at Thyatira the Lord now says, <span class="greekheb">οὐ βάλλω</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἥξω</span>. The expression <span class="greekheb">ἄλλο βάρος</span> has been understood in two chief respects, but with very different modifications of exposition; viz., either of the burden of suffering and punishment, or of the burden of a law. The norm furnished by the context, for the explanation of an expression in itself ambiguous, lies in the words <span class="greekheb">πλὴν ὃ εχ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., which in no way contain the condition of the promise <span class="greekheb">οὐ βάλλω ἐρʼ ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄλλο βάρ</span>[1275] but a certain limitation (<span class="greekheb">πλήν</span>) of the preceding promise, as the <span class="greekheb">πλήν</span> is correlate to <span class="greekheb">ἄλλο</span>. If now in the words <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-25.htm" title="But that which you have already hold fast till I come.">Revelation 2:25</a>, the manifestation of Christian steadfastness in faith is required, and therefore a certain incessant legal determination is made or established, the result is that every <span class="greekheb">ἄλλο βάρος</span> must likewise be a burden of the law, which, just because it reaches farther than the limitation indicated in the closing words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-25.htm" title="But that which you have already hold fast till I come.">Revelation 2:25</a>), should not be laid upon believers. If now it be considered that the question at issue was with respect to fornication and the eating of sacrifices made to idols, and that just in respect to this the ancient church at the Synod of Jerusalem, under the guidance of the Holy Ghost, made a definite decision, but declined all going beyond this as an intolerable burden,[1276] we could not recognize hence a clear allusion to that decree; and accordingly explain the <span class="greekheb">ἄλλο βάρος</span> of any sort of legal limitation of the holy freedom of believers, which proceeds beyond the commandment hitherto faithfully preserved by them.[1277] The <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἔχετε</span>, nevertheless, is not directly the formerly recognized and still faithfully observed prohibition to avoid fornication and the eating of what is sacrificed to idols; but the expression in its indefinite extent includes the idea that because believers have been faithful in opposition to the Nicolaitans, just in their obedience they have also had their reward, viz., the blessing of eternal life, and therefore should hold fast to this treasure,[1278] while they bear still further the burden of that commandment which was hitherto borne. If the <span class="greekheb">ἄλλο βάρος</span>, therefore, be understood of the burden of suffering, it can be explained only, with De Wette: “No other sorrow than you bear or have borne already.” For we must infer from the mention of the <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-19.htm" title="I know your works, and charity, and service, and faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first.">Revelation 2:19</a>, that suffering was already borne; while, in case this reference were to <span class="greekheb">ἂλλο βάρος</span>, a more definite allusion to suffering previously endured would be expected. Incorrectly, Heinr.: “Punishment because of another’s fault.” Incorrectly, Grot.: “They boast of the knowledge of many things; this I do not exact of you,” as though the gnosis were the <span class="greekheb">ἄλλο βάρος</span>.

To know “the depths” of the divine being and counsel was a characteristic claim of the Ophites and the later Gnostics; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Iren. <span class="ital">adv. Haer.</span> ii. 22, 1 (qui profunda bythi adinuenisse se dicunt; <span class="ital">cf.</span> 3), and Tertullian’s sarcastic description (<span class="ital">adv.

Si bona fide quaeris, concreto uultu, suspenso supercilio <span class="ital">Altum est</span> aiunt.” “The depth of knowledge” was a phrase of Herakleitus, the famous Ephesian philosopher, and in the creed of the Dukhobortsui, a sect in modern Russia, the Holy Spirit is Depth, the Father being Height and the Son Breadth. Since <span class="greekheb">ὡς λέγουσιν</span> refers to the errorists themselves, the quoted phrase about “knowing the depths of Satan” may (1.) contain an indignant and sarcastic retort; “depths of—Satan,” not “God,” as they boast (<span class="greekheb">τοῦς</span>. being substituted for <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span>); such teaching and principles are simply infernal. Or (2.) as is more probable the words may voice the actual claim of the errorists, who considered that some accommodation to pagan practices gave them a necessary acquaintance with the meaning of evil (so <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Spitta, Pfleiderer, Zahn, Jülicher, Bousset). Their higher standing gave them immunity from any risks. They could fathom securely what the immature orthodox called immorality. Devil-study, or even devil-worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-4.htm" title="And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? who is able to make war with him?">Revelation 13:4</a> is quite different) was not uncommon in some of the Gnostic sects throughout Asia Minor, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the Cainites, the Naassenes, and the Ophites (the earliest Gnostics, <span class="greekheb">φάσκοντες μόνοι τὰ βάθη γινώσκειν</span>, Hipp. <span class="ital">adv. Haer.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-6.htm" title="But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.">Revelation 2:6</a>). The idea was that as the principle of evil would ultimately be redeemed, it might be used meantime for the advantage of the initiated. Compare Mansel’s <span class="ital">Gnostic Heresies</span>, pp. 73, 96, 105. In En. lxv. 6 the unrighteous are punished for their acquaintance with “all the secrets of the angels and all the violence of the Satans and all their hidden power and all the power of those that practise sorcery, and the power of witchcraft.” The influence of a movement like Gnosticism, whose motto was <span class="ital">eritis sicut deus scientes bonum et malum</span>, gave wide opportunities to immorality, in its more popular applications. It produced the same sort of union between subtlety and sensualism which can sometimes be traced within Hinduism. In contrast to this unwholesome temper of speculation, the prophet substitutes for speculative flights the obedience of the normal Christian praxis (<span class="ital">cf. Parad. Lost</span>, viii. 170–197, xii. 561–589), with a plain allusion to the Jerusalem concordat of the early church which is recommended tacitly as a safe, wise rule of conduct. In the case of the <span class="greekheb">βαθέα τοῦ σατανᾶ</span>, ignorance is bliss. John is totally unsympathetic to the local liberals. He does not combat the theoretical principles at the root of their movement. Like the prophets who wrote Jude and 2 Peter, he attacks instead of arguing, quite content to judge it by its moral fruits of libertinism. He bitterly declares that such occasional results are the deliberate object of the party. The strange collocation of this error with the habit of partaking of sacrificial food is probably due to the prophet’s stern conviction that the latter, with its friendly and liberal attitude to pagan customs, fostered the former, in the case of people who took an ultra-spiritual view of Paul’s principle of Christian freedom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">unto you</span>] The form of address to the Angel of the Church is dropped, and the Church addressed directly. <span class="ital">And</span> should be omitted: the sense is “to the rest of you in Thyatira,” or more literally, “to you, namely to the rest.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak</span>] The heretics condemned in the preceding verses were doubtless a sect of those who called themselves Gnostics, probably at this time, certainly in the next generation.

It is uncertain how far the quotation of their own language marked by ‘as they speak’ extends, it is hardly possible that they themselves actually gloried in a knowledge of the depths of Satan (yet cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>); but it is to be remembered that the Gnostic systems of the second century, and probably those of the first also, included a strange mythology of half-personified abstractions; and it may be that the Lord rather identifies one of these with Satan than substitutes the name of Satan for that of God. It appears from Irenaeus that the Gnostics of his time talked of “the deep things of Depth” as well as “the deep things of God.” It is curious that the phrase “the depths of knowledge” is quoted from the great Ephesian philosopher Heraclitus: possibly it was owing to his influence, that such notions found a congenial home in Asia Minor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will put</span>] Right in sense, as “I will cast” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-22.htm" title="Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.">Revelation 2:22</a>, though here the true text has a present tense, as there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">none other burden</span>] viz., than abstinence from fornication and things offered to idols, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm" title="For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things;">Acts 15:28</a> sq.

The "and" after "I say" in the Authorized Version is a false reading, which it shares with the Vulgate and Luther: "to you" and "to the rest" are in apposition. Which know not the deep things of Satan, as they say. Two questions confront us here, and it is not possible to answer either with certainty: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Who is it who say something? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What is it that they say? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Note that "say" (Revised Version), not "speak" (Authorized Version), is right; the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The nominative to "say" may be either the faithful in Thyatira, "who have not this doctrine," and who show their detestation of it by calling it "the deep things of Satan;" or the holders of this doctrine, who profess to be in the possession of profound knowledge of a mysterious kind. Of these two the former is rather tame in meaning. Moreover, we should have expected "as <span class="accented">ye</span> say" to harmonize with "to you I say." Therefore we may suppose that it is those who <span class="accented">have</span> this doctrine who are indicated in "as they say." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What, then, did they say? Did they call their doctrine "deep things," which the Lord here enlarges into "deep things of Satan," in order to declare its true character? Or did they themselves call their knowledge "the deep things of Satan," which they fathomed in order to prove their mastery over them? The former seems better. It is improbable that any sect, nominally Christian, would in so many words claim special knowledge of "the deep things of Satan." Rather, he who condemns the "synagogue of Satan" (ver. 9) at Smyrna, and the "throne of Satan" (ver. 13) at Pergamum, here condemns the "deep things of Satan" at Thyatim. In any case, "deep things" is the prominent thought. It is some early form of Gnosticism that is indicated, and we know from various sources that "deep" was a favourite expression of theirs with regard to the knowledge which they professed. "The Valen-tinians have formed Eleusinian orgies, consecrated by a mighty silence, having nothing heavenly in them but their mystery. If, in good faith, you ask questions with contracted forehead and frowning brow, they say, '<span class="accented">It is profound'"</span> (Tert., 'Adv. Valent.,' 1.). Similarly, Irenaeus states that they claimed to have found out the "deep things of Bythos" <span class="accented">- "profunda Bythi adinvenisse se dicunt"</span> (II. 22:1). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (equivalent to "depth") is the primary being or god of the Valentinian system, another name for which is <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (equivalent to "unspeakable "). Hence elsewhere, for <span class="accented">profunda Bythi</span>, Irenaeus uses the expression <span class="accented">profunda Dei</span> in speaking of these Gnostic claims (II. 22:3). Similarly, Hippolytus ('Refut.,' V. 6:1) states that the Naassenes called themselves Gnostics, saying that they alone knew the depths - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is singularly close to what we have here. Note, however; that here the true reading is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, neuter plural of the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, not (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, plural of the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. See also the fragment of a letter of Valentinus, preserved in Epiphanius ('Contra Haer. adv. Valent.,' 1:31). I cast upon you none other burden. An obvious echo of the decision of the Council of Jerusalem respecting these very sins, fornication and idolatry, in reference to Christian liberty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28, 29</a>), where the very same word (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used for "burden." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-46.htm">Luke 11:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>, the word for "burden" is <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, whereas <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm">Matthew 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a>.

"None other" means none other than a more determined opposition to these specious abominations. Hold fast your own doctrine, and denounce the false. Others, much less probably, interpret "none other burden" than the sufferings in which they exhibit the "patience" for which they are praised (ver. 19). This gives a very poor meaning, and, moreover, breaks the connexion with what follows: they are certainly not told to hold fast their sufferings, but Christ's precepts as to faith and conduct. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And unto the rest<p>Omit and, and render, as Rev., to you I say, to the rest, etc.<p>And which (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Omit &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and.

"The veneration of the serpent was but the logical development of a theory, the germ of which is common to many of the Gnostic sects. Proceeding on the assumption that the creator of the world is to be regarded as an evil power, a thing in hostility to the supreme God, it follows as a natural consequence that the fall of man through disobedience to the command of his maker must be regarded, not as a transgression against the will of the supreme God, but as an emancipation from the authority of an evil being. The serpent, therefore, who tempted mankind to sin, is no longer their destroyer but their benefactor. He is the symbol of intellect, by whose means the first human pair were raised to the knowledge of the existence of higher beings than their creator. This conception, consistently carried out, would have resulted in a direct inversion of the whole teaching of scripture; in calling evil good and good evil; in converting Satan into God and God into Satan. The majority of the Ophite sects, however, seem to have shrunk from this portentous blasphemy. While acknowledging the fall of man as, in some manner, a deliverance from evil and an exaltation of human nature, they hesitated to carry out their principle by investing the evil spirit with the attributes of deity. A kind of compromise was made between scripture and philosophy. The serpent was, notwithstanding his service to mankind, represented as a being of evil nature and au enemy to man, though his work was overruled to man's good, and he himself was, beyond his intention, the instrument of a higher wisdom. Rut in one sect at least of the Ophites, the more logical and thoroughly blasphemous consequences of the first principles were exhibited openly and unblushingly" (Mansel, "Gnostic Heresies"). The characteristic boast of the Gnostics was their knowledge of the depths of divine things. In this they were probably perverting and caricaturing the words of Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>).<p>As they speak<p>Rev., as they say. The questions are, 1st. What is the phrase alluded to? Is it the familiar formula of these heretics, "the depths," or "the depths of God," the depths of Satan being added by the Lord himself in ironical contrast with the depths of divine knowledge, - or is it the depths of Satan? 2nd. Does as they say refer to Christians, describing the depths of the Gnostics as depths of Satan, or does it refer to the heretics themselves, calling their own mysteries depths of Satan?<p>The majority of commentators regard as they say as referring to the heretics, and as applying only to the word depths; of Satan being added by the Lord in indignation. Alford says that no such formula as depths of Satan, or any resembling it, is found as used by the ancient Gnostic heretics.<p>Other burden (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>The words for burden in the New Testament are &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>), &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm">Matthew 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>), and &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>). &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; refers to bulk, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; to weight, &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; to a burden so far as it is born (&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;). Thus in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, "lay aside every weight (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)," the figure being that of runners in the race-course, and the word appropriate as denoting the bulky robes and the accoutrements of the ordinary dress which might impede the freedom of the limbs. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm">Matthew 20:12</a>, "the burden (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) and heat of the day," the idea is that of heavy toil pressing like a weight. So <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>, "Bear ye one another's burdens." But in <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>, the emphasis is on the act of bearing; and therefore &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; is used: "Every man shall bear his own burden;" i.e., every man shall carry that which it is appointed him to bear. The reference in that passage is probably to the prohibition enjoined by the apostolic council of Jerusalem, which concerned the very things which are rebuked here - fornication and abstinence from idol-meats. In the narrative of that council the phrase occurs "to lay upon you no greater burden" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>). The meaning accordingly will be, "I put upon you no other burden than abstinence from and protest against these abominations." </body></html>
