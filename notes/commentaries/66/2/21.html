Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication - Probably after some direct and solemn warning of the evil of her course. The error and sin had been of long standing, but he now resolved to bear with it no longer. It is true of almost every great sinner, that sufficient time is given for repentance, and that vengeance is delayed after crime is committed. But it cannot always be deferred, for the period must arrive when no reason shall exist for longer delay, and when punishment must come upon the offender.<p>And she repented not - As she did not do it; as she showed no disposition to abandon her course; as all plea of having had no time to repent would now be taken away, it was proper that he should rise in his anger and cut her down. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. space&#8212;Greek, "time."<p>of her fornication &#8230; she repented not&#8212;The three oldest manuscripts read, "and she willeth not to repent of (literally, 'out of,' that is, so as to come out of) her fornication." Here there is a transition from literal to spiritual fornication, as appears from Re 2:22. The idea arose from Jehovah's covenant relation to the Old Testament Church being regarded as a marriage, any transgression against which was, therefore, harlotry, fornication, or adultery.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I was not quick with her, but gave her a time of patience, and did not cut her off at first; but she was incorrigible, and went on in her sinful courses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication,.... Of idolatry. This may have respect to the time of the witnesses, the Waldenses, and others, who bore a testimony against the Romish idolatry, and reproved for it, and denounced the judgment of God in case of impenitence; and as these things were repeated time after time, this may be called a space given to repent in; just as Jezebel had a space given her to repent in, from the time that Elijah declared the word of the Lord, that the dogs should eat her: so the Jews (b) say of the old world, that God gave them , "space to repent", but they repented not, as here: <p>and she repented not; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>; for the time for, and means leading to repentance may be given, yet if the grace of repentance itself is not given, men, either particular persons, or whole bodies of men, will never repent of their sins.

Thus there is no ground for the opinion[1246] that John had already before published a written rebuke. But it is correctly inferred[1247] that the woman Jezebel had for a long time already exercised her corrupt activity. Even the fact that she had been let go[1248] appears from the standpoint of Divine Providence to afford an opportunity for a time of repentance, although the church must on this account be censured.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">ὲκ</span> after <span class="greekheb">μεταν</span>.[1249] naturally stands as a designation of the movement out of sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΝΕΊΑ</span></span></span>—not “inaccurately stated for immodest pursuits leading to inchastity”[1250]—is meant precisely as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>).
