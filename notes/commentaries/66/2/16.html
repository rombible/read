It turns and cuts every way; but the believer need not fear this sword; yet this confidence cannot be supported without steady obedience. As our Lord notices all the advantages and opportunities we have for duty in the places where we dwell, so he notices our temptations and discouragements from the same causes. In a situation of trials, the church of Pergamos had not denied the faith, either by open apostacy, or by giving way so as to avoid the cross. Christ commends their stedfastness, but reproves their sinful failures. A wrong view of gospel doctrine and Christian liberty, was a root of bitterness from which evil practices grew. Repentance is the duty of churches and bodies of men, as well as of particular persons; those who sin together, should repent together. Here is the promise of favour to those that overcome. The influences and comforts of the Spirit of Christ, come down from heaven into the soul, for its support. This is hidden from the rest of the world. The new name is the name of adoption; when the Holy Spirit shows his own work in the believer's soul, this new name and its real import are understood by him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Repent - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>.<p>Or else I will come unto thee quickly - On the word "quickly," see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>.

He would come against the church for tolerating them, but his opposition would be principally directed against the Nicolaitanes themselves. The church would excite his displeasure by retaining them in its bosom, but it was in its power to save them from destruction. If the church would repent, or if it would separate itself from the evil, then the Saviour would not come against them. If this were not done, they would feel the vengeance of his sword, and be subjected to punishment. The church always suffers when it has offenders in its bosom; it has the power of saving them if it will repent of its own unfaithfulness, and will strive for their conversion.<p>With the sword of my mouth - notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a>. That is, he would give the order, and they would be cut as if by a sword. Precisely in what way it would be done he does not say; but it might be by persecution, or by heavy judgments.

The church as a whole, to whose members the Nicolaitans belong, having shared in the reproof, so also share in the admonition to repentance and the threat; for the conflict of the coming Lord, which is of course immediately directed only against the Nicolaitans (<span class="greekheb">πολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μετʼ αὐτῶν</span>), must cause suffering to the entire body of the church (<span class="greekheb">ἔρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σοι</span>).

The church as a whole must repent of her too tolerant attitude to these errorists, but the threatened visitation is directed against the errorists themselves in the shape of some physical malady or mortal sickness, according to the current belief in early Christianity (<span class="ital">cf.</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,...">1 Corinthians 5:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="But them that are without God judges.

Angelologie</span>, etc., 20 f.). Grotius refers the threat to the prophetic order (“prophetas suscitabo in ecclesia”). But the ethnic conscience generally regarded pestilence or any physical calamity as a punishment inflicted by the god for some offence against his ritual or some breach of morals. In the Hexateuch, the sword opposes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-23.htm" title="And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.">Numbers 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-31.htm" title="Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.">Numbers 22:31</a>) and finally slays (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm" title="And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.">Numbers 31:8</a>) Balaam. The run of thought in the verse is that if the church does not repent, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, if she does not act on her own initiative and expel the wrongdoers (in the hope of them ultimately coming to a better mind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,...">1 Corinthians 5:4-5</a>), she must submit to having them cut out of her, and thus being irretrievably lost by death. The church is responsible for her erring members, and the exercise of discipline is viewed as a duty to them as well as to herself and God. Weak laxity is false kindness, the prophet implies; it merely exposes offenders to an alternative far more dreadful than discipline itself. The sword, Viet, remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>, is used to punish deserters as well as to win victory for the faithful. For instrumental <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> in the pre-Christian vernacular, see <span class="ital">Tebtunis Papyri</span> vol. 1.

But the <span class="ital">Italian</span> Version, which is nearest to the hand of John, did not contain the word <span class="ital">quickly</span>. To the writers who followed that reading, <span class="ital">Ansbert</span> is added with considerable regularity, and <span class="ital">Bede</span> and <span class="ital">Ambrose</span>, also, in Psalms 118. Serm. 19; nor has <span class="ital">Apringius</span> the word <span class="ital">quickly</span> in his paraphrase on this passage. It will be worth while to have turned over the Latin MSS. of the Apocalypse in this place. Sometimes the fuller reading is the genuine one, but generally the shorter. I will say under what circumstances each holds good. The fuller reading is sometimes to be preferred. For I. in the case of words having a similar ending, or in the recurrence of words or syllables, the copyists have easily passed over the intermediate text, which is to be restored from the more ancient authorities. II. Conjunctions, which are less frequent in other languages than in Greek, are often omitted in the Versions, which it is useless to follow too closely in this particular. III. The Greeks frequently removed something from the public reading, to which many copies were accommodated: and in such cases the fuller reading ought to be retained, if supported by the other authorities of greatest antiquity, and especially the <span class="ital">Latin</span> Version. Examples are of constant occurrence. If we except these three causes, <span class="ital">brevity</span> is an all but invariable characteristic of a genuine reading. For since the Greek copies, and the translators and fathers who have followed them, are to be divided into two classes, namely, into those of Asia and of Africa, as I have copiously explained in my Apparatus, you will seldom find that manuscripts of both classes endeavoured to fill up short passages by certain explanations of their own, though you will find in some places that many of the one class, and in some that many of the other, have done so. Hence the fuller reading, which now is too scrupulously defended by many, is almost always a counterfeit; whereas the shorter reading is genuine. In such passages the witnesses, however few they are, provided that they have sufficient antiquity, ought to have weight: in which particular the <span class="ital">Latin</span> witnesses are again conspicuous, as we have remarked, a little while ago, at ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm" title="Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.">Revelation 1:11</a>. Where such crumbs are treated of, it is indeed better in such an abundance of bread to pass over something genuine, than eagerly to catch at anything heterogeneous and infected by human feeling. That is undoubtedly to be preferred in every place, which is required by reasons peculiar to the passage under consideration. <span class="ital">Here no critic can compel others to agree with him; but, on the other hand, others can have no control over him</span>. We return to the particle <span class="ital">quickly</span>. The Lord repeatedly announces His coming in the Apocalypse, and chiefly so from ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-5.htm" title="Remember therefore from where you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his place, except you repent.">Revelation 2:5</a> to ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a> : and that in such a manner, that He may make His coming gradually nearer. The particle <span class="ital">quickly</span> is used at last, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-11.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which you have, that no man take your crown.">Revelation 3:11</a>; and therefore in the passage now before us, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-16.htm" title="Repent; or else I will come to you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.">Revelation 2:16</a>, it has not yet a place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] The only good authority for <span class="ital">omitting</span> <span class="greekheb">ταχύ</span> is the “Italian,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the Ante-Hieronymic Version, supposed to be of African origin.
