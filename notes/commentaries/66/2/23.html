The so-called prophetess led the way in looseness of morals, under the pretence of some deeper knowledge. She had her associates and their disciples; the evil and the evil consequences would grow; the disciples outrun their teachers, and more than tribulation—death—is their penalty.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-29 Even when the Lord knows the works of his people to be wrought in love, faith, zeal, and patience; yet if his eyes, which are as a flame of fire, observe them committing or allowing what is evil, he will rebuke, correct, or punish them. Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will kill her children with death - A strong Hebraistic mode of expression, meaning that he would certainly destroy them. It has been made a question whether the word "children" here is to be taken literally or figuratively. The word itself would admit of either interpretation; and there is nothing in the connection by which its meaning here can be determined. If it is to be taken literally, it is in accordance with what is often threatened in the Scriptures, that children shall be visited with calamity for the sins of parents, and with what often occurs in fact, that they do thus suffer. For it is no uncommon thing that whole families are made desolate on account of the sin and folly of the parent. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>. If it is to be taken figuratively, then it refers to those who had imbibed her doctrines, and who, of course, would suffer in the punishment which would follow from the propagation of such doctrines. The reference in the word "death" here would seem to be to some heavy judgment, by plague, famine, or sword, by which they would be cut off.<p>And all the churches shall know, ... - That is, the design of this judgment will be so apparent that it will convince all that I know what is in the hearts of people, even the secret acts of wickedness that are concealed from human view.<p>I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts - This is clearly a claim to omniscience; and as it is the Lord Jesus who speaks in all these epistles, it is a full proof that he claims this for himself. There is nothing which more clearly pertains to God than the power of searching the heart, and nothing that is more constantly claimed by him as his special prerogative, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-21.htm">Psalm 44:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-12.htm">Jeremiah 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>. The word "reins" - &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;  nephrous - means, literally, "the kidney," and is commonly used in the plural to denote the kidneys, or the loins. In the Scriptures it is used to denote the inmost mind, the secrets of the soul; probably because the parts referred to by the word are as hidden as any other part of the frame, and would seem to be the repository of the more secret affections of the mind. It is not to be supposed that it is taught in the Scriptures that the reins are the real seat of any of the affections or passions; but there is no more impropriety in using the term in a popular signification than there is in using the word "heart," which all continue to use, to denote the seat of love.<p>And I will give unto every one of you according to your works - To every one of you; not only to those who have embraced these opinions, but to all the church.

And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.">Revelation 6:8</a>. If any particular form of death is meant, it may be pestilence (the inscriptions often mention fever), which represented to an Oriental mind the punishment of God on man’s unfaithfulness. The curious difference between the treatment of the <span class="greekheb">μοιχ</span>. and the <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span> is due to the fact that (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm" title="And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.">Daniel 6:24</a>), a parent’s sin was visited upon his family, both in Jewish and in contemporary pagan belief (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the Phrygian inscription, cited by Mayor on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">Jam 5:12</a>, <span class="greekheb">κατηράμενος ἤτω αὐτὸς καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ</span>). Yet even when both classes are allegorised into active coadjutors and deluded victims, the relative punishment looks unequal. John, unlike Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/13-17.htm" title="And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name....">Revelation 13:17-18</a>), holds that the victims of the false prophetess are willing and responsible for their position.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶσαι αἱ ἐκκλ</span>., the judgment was to be as notorious as evidently the scandal had been.
