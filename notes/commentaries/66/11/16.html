They were seated on <span class= "ital">thrones,</span> not “seats” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>), as in English version; the word used is the same which is translated “throne” when it refers to our Lord. It is the same word which is rendered “seat” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm" title="And the fifth angel poured out his vial on the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,">Revelation 16:10</a>) when it refers to Satan; but it is better rendered <span class= "ital">throne</span> throughout, for by this variation of translation, as “Archbishop Trench has pointed out, two great ideas which run through this book, and, indeed, we may say through the whole of the New Testament, are obliterated: the one, that the true servants of Christ are crowned with Him and share His sovereignty; the other, that the antagonism of the Prince of Darkness to the Prince of Light develops itself in the hellish parody of the heavenly kingdom” (Prof. Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">Revision of New Testament,</span> p. 41). It is specially desirable that this thought should be kept before us in this passage, which proclaims that the kingdom and throne and power of the wicked one have passed away, and the hour has come when the victorious saints may sit down with Christ in His throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:14-19 Before the sounding of the seventh and last trumpet, there is the usual demand of attention. The saints and angels in heaven know the right of our God and Saviour to rule over all the world. But the nations met God's wrath with their own anger. It was a time in which he was beginning to reward his people's faithful services, and sufferings; and their enemies fretted against God, and so increased their guilt, and hastened their destruction. By the opening the temple of God in heaven, may be meant, that there was a more free communication between heaven and earth; prayer and praises more freely and frequently going up, graces and blessings plentifully coming down. But it rather seems to refer to the church of God on earth. In the reign of antichrist, God's law was laid aside, and made void by traditions and decrees; the Scriptures were locked up from the people, but now they are brought to the view of all. This, like the ark, is a token of the presence of God returned to his people, and his favour toward them in Jesus Christ, as the Propitiation for their sins. The great blessing of the Reformation was attended with very awful providences; as by terrible things in righteousness God answered the prayers presented in his holy temple now opened.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the four and twenty elders which sat ... - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>.<p>Fell upon their faces, and worshipped God - Prostrated themselves before him - the usual form of profound adoration.

Similar ascriptions of praise on the part of the twenty-four elders. <span class="greekheb">ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτων</span>, like all angels.

They <span class="ital">give thanks</span>, not because they consider themselves partakers of the great power and government of God,[2979] which is as remote as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a>, but because (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΕἼΛΗΦΑς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>) the assumption of dominion on God’s part has brought to the oppressors of the Church, whose representatives the elders are, retributory vengeance, but to the servants of God the complete reward.[2980] The ascription of adoration, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΎΡΙΕ Ὁ ΘΕῸς Ὁ ΠΑΝΤΟΚΡΆΤΩΡ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, in which the guaranty for the glorious result of God’s ways was previously indicated,[2981] appears now when that glorious end is beheld as already attained to be actually realized.[2982] But from the former significant designation of God, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ὪΝ ΚΑῚ Ὁ ἮΝ ΚΑῚ Ὁ ἘΡΧΌΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>,[2983] this last point necessarily is omitted; for the ascription of praise, even though proleptical, applies even to that which has now come, and thus the fulfilment of his mystery has been attained.[2984] Luther improperly follows the bad revision of the text, in which the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ Ὁ ἘΡΧ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is interpolated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, said the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΕἼΛΗΦΑς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΔΎΝΑΜΊΝ ΣΟΥ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΜΕΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ἘΒΑΣΊΛΕΥΣΑς</span></span></span>. The assumption of great powrer[2985] is the means for entrance upon the kingdom;[2986] but as the exclamation <span class="greekheb">κύριε ὁ θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ</span> properly conditions the mode of representation in the <span class="greekheb">ἐβασίλευσας</span>, the <span class="greekheb">σου</span> with the <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δύναμ</span>. marks also the presupposition that it was only, apparently, that the unconditioned power which he has now seized was not possessed by the eternal Ruler of all, while he allowed the antichristian powers to be exercised against himself and his Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>. According to the fundamental thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm" title="But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given to the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.">Revelation 11:2</a>,[2987] although the expression comes from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-1.htm" title="The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.">Psalm 99:1</a>,[2988] there is a description of how the wrath of God has risen against the wrath of his enemies, to the destruction of the destroyers, in the final judgment which brings its reward to the servants of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The more minute description in the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ἜΘΝΗ ὨΡΓΊΣΘΗΣΑΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἼΛΗΦΑς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΔΎΝ</span>., <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm" title="Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and were, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned.">Revelation 11:17</a>,[2989] which occurs in the final judgment described here in all its parts, is subjoined by the simple <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ</span></span></span>. But the entire ascription of adoration proves itself to be so clearly a prolepsis of that which is not represented in details until in the visions following that extend up to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>, and comprise the actual end, that even the expressions mostly agree with those of the succeeding chapter. The explanation of the tenor of the subject is to be derived from what follows. How the enraged Gentiles, impelled by the anger of the devil,[2990] come forth against the Lord and his servants, is, of course, to be seen already from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-9.htm" title="And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.">Revelation 11:9</a> sqq.;[2991] but the complete representation of the Gentile antichrist is given first in what follows,[2992] and it properly pertains to this, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἨΛΘΕΝ Ἡ ὈΡΓΉ ΣΟΥ</span></span></span> is described as actually entering, first in chs. 16–18, and then <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:">Revelation 19:1</a> sqq., is celebrated as actually occurring, just as in this passage proleptically. The expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῪς ΔΙΑΦΘΕΊΡΟΝΤΑς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΓῆΝ</span></span></span> is to be understood first from the entire description of Babylon, the antichristian secular power.[2993] The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΙΡῸς ΤῶΝ ΝΕΚΡῶΝ ΚΡΙΘῆΝΑΙ</span></span></span>, which is celebrated in this passage proleptically as having already occurred (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἨΛΘΕΝ</span></span></span>), occurs actually not until in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a> sqq.; so also the time for giving the servants of God their reward occurs actually not until the Divine completion of the mystery of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῖς ΔΟΎΛΟΙς ΣΟΥ</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΜΕΓΆΛΟΙς</span></span></span>.
