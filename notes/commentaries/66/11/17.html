We can catch the echo of the Second Psalm throughout this chorus of grateful praise. The prayers of the groaning Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/18-7.htm" title="And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night to him, though he bear long with them?">Luke 18:7-8</a>) and the cries of travailing creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>) have been heard; though the heathen raged and the people imagined a vain thing, their counsel against the Lord and His anointed, His Christ (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,">Revelation 11:16</a>), came to nought; the joy of their triumph was short-lived; the kingdom of evil was but for a moment; the kings were assembled, they passed by, they saw, they were troubled, they hasted away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/48-4.htm" title="For, see, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.">Psalm 48:4-5</a>); never did the real sovereignty of the Lord cease (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>); but the nations would not believe in His rule; they were not wise; they turned from the kiss of reconciliation, which was life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/2-10.htm" title="Be wise now therefore, O you kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth.">Psalm 2:10-12</a>); then came His anger, and the season of judgment and the season of reward. The prophets, the saints, and those that fear God’s name, the small and the great— every class and rank of the true servants of the King are included here; none are forgotten; not a cup of cold water, given in His name, shall miss its reward; for not alone the pre-eminent in Christian power and in Christian holiness, but the weak, the struggling, the obscure, the small as well as the great, are remembered: “Unto the God of gods appeareth every one of them in Zion” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm" title="They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appears before God.">Psalm 84:7</a>; Prayer Book version). Nor is the gladness only for this blessing; there is a joy at the overthrow of those who destroy the earth. The reign of evil is the destruction of the earth. The judgments of God are in mercy to stay the spread of destructive powers and principles. The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel; the very judgments of God are merciful. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-2.htm" title="And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.">Revelation 8:2</a>.)<p>But where, we may be disposed to ask, is the “woe” in all this? We are led to expect that the seventh trumpet as a woe trumpet will bring in some period of pain and trouble, as the others have done; but all we hear is the chorus of glad voices uttering praise: we see no token of woe. The answer is that we must not overlook all that this song of rejoicing implies. The chorus we hear is the thanksgiving to God that the hour has come for the overthrow of the kingdom of evil, the manifestation of the sons of God, and the acknowledgment throughout the world of the sovereignty of the Lord and of His Christ. The overthrow of that evil kingdom, which is now to take place, brings with it woo to those who have supported it; for the time of the judgment of the dead, and of those whose lives have marred God’s world, has come. It is, then, woe on all those who have misused God’s gifts and those beautiful things which He gave us liberally to enjoy. It is a woe on those who have defiled those bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost, profaned the earth, which is God’s footstool, or darkened by their evil deeds the heaven, which is His throne. Those who thus defile (or, <span class= "ital">destroy:</span> the word is so in the margin, and is the same as that which follows) God’s temple anywhere, God will destroy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.">1Corinthians 3:17</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:14-19 Before the sounding of the seventh and last trumpet, there is the usual demand of attention. The saints and angels in heaven know the right of our God and Saviour to rule over all the world. But the nations met God's wrath with their own anger. It was a time in which he was beginning to reward his people's faithful services, and sufferings; and their enemies fretted against God, and so increased their guilt, and hastened their destruction. By the opening the temple of God in heaven, may be meant, that there was a more free communication between heaven and earth; prayer and praises more freely and frequently going up, graces and blessings plentifully coming down. But it rather seems to refer to the church of God on earth. In the reign of antichrist, God's law was laid aside, and made void by traditions and decrees; the Scriptures were locked up from the people, but now they are brought to the view of all. This, like the ark, is a token of the presence of God returned to his people, and his favour toward them in Jesus Christ, as the Propitiation for their sins. The great blessing of the Reformation was attended with very awful providences; as by terrible things in righteousness God answered the prayers presented in his holy temple now opened.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Saying, We give thee thanks - We, as the representatives of the church, and as identified in our feelings with it (see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>), acknowledge thy goodness in tires delivering the church from all its troubles, and having conducted it through the times of fiery persecution, thus establishing it upon the earth. The language here used is an expression of their deep interest in the church, and of the fact that they felt themselves identified with it. They, as representatives of the church, would of course rejoice in its prosperity and final triumph.<p>O Lord God Almighty - Referring to God all-powerful, because it was by his omnipotent arm alone that this great work had been I accomplished. Nothing else could have I defended the church in its many trials; nothing else could have established it upon the earth.<p>Which art, and wast, and art to come - The Eternal One, always the same. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>. The reference here is to the fact that God, who had thus established his church on the earth, is unchanging. In all the revolutions which occur on the earth, he always remains the same. What he was in past times he is now; what he is now he always will be. The particular idea suggested here seems to be, that he had now shown this by having caused his church to triumph; that is, he had shown that he was the same God who had early promised that it should ultimately triumph; he had carried forward his glorious purposes without modifying or abandoning them amidst all the changes that had occurred in the world; and he had thus given the assurance that he would now remain the same, and that all his purposes in regard to his church would be accomplished. The fact that God remains always unchangeably the same is the sole reason why his church is safe, or why any individual member of it is kept and saved. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>.<p>Because thou hast taken to thee thy great power - To wit, by setting up thy kingdom over all the earth. Before that it seemed as if he had relaxed that power, or had given the power to others. Satan had reigned on the earth. Disorder, anarchy, sin, rebellion, had prevailed. It seemed as if God had let the reins of government fall from his hand. Now he came forth as if to resume the dominion over the world, and to take the scepter into his own hand, and to exert his great power in keeping the nations in subjection. The setting up of his kingdom all over the world, and causing his laws everywhere to be obeyed, will be among the highest demonstrations of divine power. Nothing can accomplish this but the power of God; when that power is exerted nothing can prevent its accomplishment.<p>And hast reigned - Prof. Stuart, "and shown thyself as king" - that is, "hast become king, or acted as a king." The idea is, that he had now vindicated his regal power (Robinson, Lexicon) - that is, he had now set up his kingdom on the earth, and had truly begun to reign. One of the characteristics of the millennium - and indeed the main characteristic will be that God will be everywhere obeyed; for when that occurs all will be consummated that properly enters into the idea of the millennial kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. thanks&#8212;for the answer to our prayers (Re 6:10, 11) in destroying them which destroy the earth (Re 11:18), thereby preparing the way for setting up the kingdom of Thyself and Thy saints.<p>and art to come&#8212;omitted in A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Cyprian, and Andreas.

See App. Crit. Ed. ii. on this passage. Such varieties of reading are not to be decided in a cursory manner, on common grounds, but by careful investigation, according to the strong arguments which peculiarly and naturally belong to each passage. By which method we shall find, in the present instance, that this passage, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm" title="Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and were, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned.">Revelation 11:17</a>, is not so much to be compared with the three preceding, as with the one which follows, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5</a>. What is the aspect of the three preceding passages, we have before shown, on the passages themselves, and especially on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, said the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.">Revelation 1:8</a> : but now both these passages, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm" title="Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and were, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned.">Revelation 11:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5</a>, coincide with the trumpet of the seventh angel, and therefore with the consummation of the mystery of God, in which, that which had previously been foretold by the expression, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, now is exhibited in actual operation, and indeed is exhibited first in heaven, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm" title="Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and were, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned.">Revelation 11:17</a>, and then on earth, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5</a>. Interpreters on this passage have long ago seen this. Ansbert says, <span class="ital">They do not here subjoin, as they were accustomed</span>, and who art to come; <span class="ital">they speak of Him as already present</span>. Haymo, who usually treads in the footsteps of Ansbert: <span class="ital">It must be observed that he does not add, as before</span>, who art to come. <span class="ital">For they show Him already present in the judgment, by which all these things will be accomplished, and therefore they by no means speak of Him as (still) to come</span>. John Purvey, in his Comm. published with the preface of Luther, says; <span class="ital">He does not add the third clause, which he has usually added, namely</span>, and who is to come, <span class="ital">for this reason, because the prophet, with his intellectual vision, then saw God as it were already sitting in judgment</span>. Zeltner published a dissertation, A. 1712, which is inscribed, <span class="ital">Evangelium Tetragrammaton e Novo Testamento Exulans</span>. The subject, as it is comprised in the title, derives something from the truth. When the Son of God was engaged in the world, of the promises given in the Old Testament, and comprehended in the name of <span class="ital">Jehovah</span>, as many as were to be fulfilled at that time, were fulfilled: and then, that which had been future, was advancing to the present. But, however, in the prophecy of the New Testament, that is, in the Apocalypse, that phrase, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὤν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, by which the tetragrammaton, <span class="greekheb">יהוה</span>, is usually expressed, is, as it were, set forth afresh; and the future itself, as though reviving in the second coming of Christ, respecting which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm" title="For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.">Hebrews 10:37</a>, is placed before us, until at the entrance of the most important trumpet of the seventh angel, first the words, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, which, at the beginning, were alone contained in <span class="greekheb">אהיה</span>, and afterwards also the words <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ ἦν</span>, which was denoted by the termination of the noun <span class="greekheb">יהוה</span>, are most magnificently absorbed, and pass into the single expression, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὤν</span>. Hence it comes to pass, that even great things, from this very passage, are not said <span class="ital">to come</span>, as lately they were said <span class="ital">to come</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-14.htm" title="The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.">Revelation 11:14</a>, and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-12.htm" title="One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.">Revelation 9:12</a>, but <span class="ital">to have come</span>, shortly afterwards, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>, and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm" title="Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.">Revelation 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-15.htm" title="And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle, and reap: for the time is come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.">Revelation 14:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7</a>. Those persons do not sufficiently hold fast the normal force of Scripture, which ought to be retained even in addresses, who even still in prayers, and in hymns, from time to time, say, <span class="ital">Jehovah</span>, instead of <span class="ital">Lord</span>, or <span class="ital">Jah</span>. For under the trumpet of the seventh angel this <span class="ital">Tetragrammaton</span> ceases to be used, and the <span class="ital">Diagrammaton</span>, <span class="greekheb">יָהּ</span>, is the only expression which the saints utter, together with applause; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:">Revelation 19:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[121] Added by Rec.
