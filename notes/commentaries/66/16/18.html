The throne of the wild beast has been visited, the centre of his power smitten; now the metropolis of his empire is about to fall. <span class= "ital">And the great city </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Babylon, the symbol of the world-power’s capital) <span class= "ital">became into three parts.</span> It lost its power of cohesion. The three evil spirits endeavoured to unite all powers in one grand assault, but there is no natural cohesion among those whose only bond is hatred of good. The first convulsion shakes them to pieces, and the cities of the nations fall. Every subordinate power in which the earthly element was mingled (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/2-41.htm" title="And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, for as much as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.">Daniel 2:41-44</a>) is overthrown in the earthquake, even as every tree which the “Heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-13.htm" title="But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.">Matthew 15:13</a>); and great Babylon was remembered before God, &c. The features of the overthrow of Babylon are described more fully later on (Revelation 17, 18), where the various aspects of evil in the great metropolis of the world-power are dealt with (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/18-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.">Revelation 18:1-3</a>).

The church triumphant in heaven saw it and rejoiced; the church in conflict on earth saw it and became triumphant. God remembered the great and wicked city; though for some time he seemed to have forgotten her idolatry and cruelty. All that was most secure was carried away by the ruin. Men blasphemed: the greatest judgments that can befal men, will not bring to repentance without the grace of God. To be hardened against God, by his righteous judgments, is a certain token of sure and utter destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings - Accompanying the voice that was heard from the throne.

Mr. Daubuz applies the whole of this vial to the, Reformation, when such a revolution was made in a short time, as has not been known since the world was, or men became worshippers of the beast; at which time Christendom was divided into three parts, the eastern or Greek church, the western or Latin church, and the reformed churches. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{25}</span> And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <i>and</i> so great.</span><p>(25) Now is declared the execution (as is said) in Re 16:17 and the things that shall last come to pass in heaven and in earth before the overthrow of the beast of Babylon: both generally in Re 16:18 and particularly in the cursed city, and such as have any familiarity with it, in the last verses.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/revelation/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-18.htm" title="And there were voices, and thunders, and lightning; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were on the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.">Revelation 16:18</a>. The conventional stormtheophany brings on an exceptionally severe earthquake, which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>) shatters Jerusalem into three parts and entirely overthrows the pagan cities.

Probably <span class="ital">the great city</span> is Jerusalem (sc <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Andr., Bengel, Simcox, B. Weiss, J.

She is distinguished from the Gentile cities as Rome also is singled out from her allies and adherents. Being primarily guilty, Rome-Babylon is reserved for a special fate. The whole passage is enigmatic and obscure. Did the earthquake destroy the inhabitants of Jerusalem? and why? The allusion must be to some form of the tradition underlying <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein....">Revelation 11:1-13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe....">Revelation 14:18-20</a>, or to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/14-4.htm" title="And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in the middle thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south....">Zechariah 14:4-5</a>.
