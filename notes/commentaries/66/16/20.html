The church triumphant in heaven saw it and rejoiced; the church in conflict on earth saw it and became triumphant. God remembered the great and wicked city; though for some time he seemed to have forgotten her idolatry and cruelty. All that was most secure was carried away by the ruin. Men blasphemed: the greatest judgments that can befal men, will not bring to repentance without the grace of God. To be hardened against God, by his righteous judgments, is a certain token of sure and utter destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And every island fled away - Expressive of great and terrible judgments, as if the very earth were convulsed, and everything were moved out of its place.

Here, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm" title="And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.">Revelation 6:14</a>, the removal of hills tallies with the Iranian belief (shared by later Jewish Christian apocalyptic, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Böklen, 131 f.) that mountains as the work of Ahriman would disappear with him (<span class="ital">S. B. E.</span> ver. 129), leaving the earth in its ideal state of a smooth plane on which mankind could dwell in unity of speech and intercourse, free from barriers. The collocation of mountain and island (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm" title="And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.">Revelation 6:14</a>) is possibly a relic of the ancient point of view, for which (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, for dwellers in the West) these formed the apparent source of the sun’s rising, where his light first became visible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">every island</span> &c.] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm" title="And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.">Revelation 6:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">great hail</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-7.htm" title="The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast on the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.">Revelation 8:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm" title="And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightning, and voices, and thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail.">Revelation 11:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">about the weight of a talent</span>] While natural hailstones weighing the sixtieth part of one are noticed as extraordinary. Some notice, that the stones thrown by the engines at the siege of Jerusalem are said to have been of a talent weight: but it would be far-fetched to suppose these referred to. In this verse at least, the judgement described cannot be on Jerusalem—see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm" title="And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.">Revelation 11:13</a> fin.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</span> This continues the description of the earthquake in ver. 18, the parenthesis concerning Babylon occurring owing to the mention of the destruction of the city (cf. the account given under the sixth seal). Such convulsions of nature generally, in biblical descriptions, accompany the near approach of the last judgment. Some writers interpret the islands and mountains of kingdoms (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9, 10</a>). </body></html>
