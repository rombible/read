As it is poured out on the rivers and springs of waters, they become blood. It is not only the great sea which becomes blood, but all the merry streams and babbling brooks which carry their tribute of water seawards also turn corrupt. And this plague is acknowledged by heavenly voices as a just retribution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5-7</a>). The streams and rivers feed the sea; they are the powers and influences which go to the making up of the great popular sentiment; these are smitten by the same corruption. Men cannot worship worldliness or earthliness without degrading even those who contribute to their instruction, their recreations, and their joys, to the same level. When the public taste grows corrupt, the literature will, for example, become so in a more or less degree; the up-flowing tide will colour the down-coming stream. “The morality of a nation’s art,” writes a modern critic. “always rises to the level of morality in a nation’s manners. Morality takes care of itself, and always revenges any outrage which art may put upon its laws by either lowering the art that so offends, or extinguishing it” (Dallas, <span class= "ital">Gay Science, </span>Vol. II., 16). It is true in even a wider sense. The loftier powers of imagination, the range of poetical elevation, are cramped and killed in a base, world-worshipping age. The streams of life grow putrid, the fresh and bright gifts of God are polluted, when the ocean of public thought is unwholesome.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/16-4.htm" title="And the third angel poured out his vial on the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood....">Revelation 16:4-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers a fountains of waters, </span>&c. — Or those territories of the Papacy which were as necessary to it as rivers and fountains are to a country: the kind of plague under this vial being the same as that of the former. For, as the former destroyed the living creatures, <span class="ital">or living souls, </span>that were <span class="ital">in </span>or upon <span class="ital">the sea, </span>namely, the Spaniards, the great mariners of the world at that time, as to their maritime power, who after the year 1588 lost their former sovereignty of the seas, it being transferred to the English and Dutch; so this latter plague makes it difficult for the Popish party to subsist and maintain their ground, even in the inland countries, particularly in the several dominions of Germany and the neighbouring countries. For in the year 1617, Ferdinand being forced upon the Bohemians by the Emperor Matthias, and crowned king, the foundation of new quarrels was thus laid. For, a little while after, another most bloody religious war ensued, which shook all the empire, and excited the terror of all Europe. And, though the Protestants lost <span class="ital">Bohemia, </span>the <span class="ital">Palatinate </span>in part, and were driven out of Moravia, Austria, and Silesia, at this time, and were not only persecuted in many places, but were in danger of being extirpated and rooted out universally; yet the tide turned all on a sudden. For after the emperor had ruled Germany with a veteran army for a considerable time, Gustavus Adolphus entered it in the year 1630, and conquered everywhere. And though he was killed about two years afterward, yet his army continued to be victorious; until at length all things were settled at the peace of Munster, A.D. 1648; with which therefore the period of this vial, consisting of thirty- one years, must be supposed to end. Now, as this began with persecutions against, and cruelties upon the Protestants; so at length the angel of the waters is heard to give thanks to God for causing the enemies of his people at last to drink of their own blood. To which song of praise another angel says, <span class="ital">Amen: </span>all which seems to denote the joy of the Protestant states and churches on the success of the Swedish arms against the emperor.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-7 We are to pray that the will of God may be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Here is a succession of terrible judgments of Providence; and there seems to be an allusion to several of the plagues of Egypt. The sins were alike, and so were the punishments. The vials refer to the seven trumpets, which represented the rise of antichrist; and the fall of the enemies of the church shall bear some resemblance to their rise. All things throughout their earth, their air, their sea, their rivers, their cities, all are condemned to ruin, all accursed for the wickedness of that people. No wonder that angels, who witness or execute the Divine vengeance on the obstinate haters of God, of Christ, and of holiness, praise his justice and truth; and adore his awful judgments, when he brings upon cruel persecutors the tortures they made his saints and prophets suffer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters - This coincides also with the account of the sounding of the third trumpet <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10-11</a>; "And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters." As to the meaning of the phrase, "rivers and fountains of waters," see the notes on that passage. We found, it was supposed, in the application of that passage, that the invasion of the Roman empire by Attila, king of the Huns, was referred to, affecting mainly those parts of the empire where the rivers and streams had their origin. The analogy would lead us, in the fulfillment of the passage before us, to look for some similar desolations on those portions of Europe. See the notes at the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-7.htm">Revelation 16:7</a>.<p>And they became blood - This would properly mean that they became as blood; or became red with blood; and it would be fulfilled if bloody battles were fought near them, so that they seemed to run blood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

It seemeth a little hard to interpret a prophecy relating to the whole church, by what is done in so small a part of it. We know in what credit these emissaries are at this day, both in the empire, and in Spain, and in France, and Venice, from whence they sometime were expelled. We have, indeed, laws against them in England, but principally relating to those of them who, being native subjects of England, have apostatized. So as I had rather think this vial is not yet poured out, or that interpreters mistake the meaning of these <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">rivers and fountains, </span> than agree with them in that interpretation of this prophecy. I am much disposed to believe that we are not further than the pouring out of the second vial. God, indeed, hath made the Romish clergy contemptible enough, and hath vexed and enraged them sufficiently. He hath also made their scenical religion as contemptible to, and justly abhorred by, a great part of the Christian world; but how far he hath proceeded further to the ruin of antichrist, I do not understand. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the third angel poured his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters,.... Which also is not to be literally understood of a stagnation of them, before the burning of the world; nor of the destruction of Popish fleets and navies, such as the Spanish armada in 1588, and others since; but rather of Popish writings, of the most learned and subtle men among them, who like rivers and fountains, which supply and fill the sea, support and keep up the Romish jurisdiction and hierarchy; and of the confutation of them by Protestant writers; and of the utter destruction of their principal orders, and chief men among them, as cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, Jesuits, &amp;c. though it seems chiefly to design the places near to Rome, such as Italy and Savoy; for as the third trumpet affects the rivers and fountains, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10</a> and brings in the Huns into Italy, and issued in the destruction of the empire; so the third vial affects the same, and brings terrible wars, and great effusion of blood, where so much of the blood of the saints have been shed: hence it follows, and they became blood; these countries will be covered with blood, and a reformation will ensue upon it; the allusion is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</span><p>(5) The story of the third angel striking the rivers, in this verse, who proclaiming the justice of God, commends the same by a grave comparison of the sins of men, with the punishment of God: which is common to this place, and that which went before.

It is true, indeed, that, as to the form of the expression, it is not said that the streams became blood; the reading is not <span class="greekheb">ἐγένοντο</span>. But the analogy with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-11.htm" title="And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.">Revelation 8:11</a>[3682] suggests that the blood entered into the streams into which the vials were poured.[3683]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Since the streams are thus affected by the plague, the angel who presides over the waters is the first to recognize adoringly the righteousness of this Divine manifestation of wrath.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῪ ἈΓΓΈΛΟΥ ΤῶΝ ὙΔΆΤΩΝ</span></span></span>. Incorrectly, Grotius: “Because he emptied the vial into the waters.” A definite angel is meant, who is placed over the streams as a special sphere.[3684] There is an analogy not so much in what is presented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18</a>,—for what is said there of the angels of wind and fire[3685] is not meant in the same sense,—as rather in the idea of the four beings who appear in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a> sqq. as representatives of earthly creatures.[3686] Precisely similar[3687] is Daniel’s representation of angelic princes who belong to particular nations.[3688] Cf. also Schöttgen, <span class="ital">Hor. Hebr.</span>, on this passage; and Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">Entd. Judenth.</span>, ii. 377 sq., where a large number of rabbinical expressions concerning earth-, sea-, fire-, and other angels, and their special names, are collected. In <span class="ital">Bava Bathra</span>, p. 72, 2,[3689] the prince of the sea is called <span class="greekheb">רתב</span>, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm" title="He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.">Job 26:12</a>; in another book,[3690] he is called Michael, and seven less important angels stand beneath him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΣΙΟς</span></span></span>.

As the solemn formula <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ὪΝ ΚΑῚ Ὁ ἩΝ</span></span></span>[3691] does not allow an immediate combination with <span class="greekheb">ὅσιος</span>,[3692] and as before <span class="greekheb">ὅσιος</span>, neither <span class="greekheb">ὁ</span>, nor <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, nor <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ</span>, dare be read,[3693] and consequently the translation of Hengstenb.

An attempt has been made to evade the idea of the text that the words of praise proceed from the altar itself, by the interpolation of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΛΛΟΥ</span></span></span> (sc. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑΓΓΈΛΟΥ</span></span></span>), <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ</span></span></span> before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΥΣ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>,[3697] or by allegorizing,[3698] or by the supply of a personality.[3699] But De Wette correctly acknowledges[3700] the significant personification of the altar itself. This is in some measure prepared for already by <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-13.htm" title="And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,">Revelation 9:13</a>; but the idea embodied therein is to be recognized from <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm" title="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10</a> sqq., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-13.htm" title="And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,">Revelation 9:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18</a>.

The divisions adopted in the first four vials correspond to those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>, which designate the whole of God's created world, "heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The third angel<p>Omit angel.<p>They became (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>There is no necessity for rendering the singular verb in the plural.
