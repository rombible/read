We may recall the similar action of Moses before Pharaoh, when he took ashes of the furnace and sprinkled it towards heaven, but it descended towards earth, as a symbol of the plague about to fall upon the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/9-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.">Exodus 9:8-10</a>). The hot ashes are the tokens of the coming judgments. As in the parallel vision in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.">Ezekiel 10:2</a>), when the man clothed with linen is bidden to “go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill his hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the doomed city;” so here the ashes fall—the judgments are at hand<p><span class= "bld">And there were voices</span> <span class= "bld">. . </span>.—Or, <span class= "ital">And there took place thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</span> There is some variety among the MSS. in the order of the words here used. Some place “lightnings” before “voices.” These signs and sounds herald the approach of judgments. God has arisen in answer to the cry of His people. “The earth shook and trembled. There went up a smoke and a fire: coals were kindled at it. At the brightness that was before Him His thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire. The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave His voice, hailstones and coals of fire. Yea, He sent out His arrows, and scattered them: He shot out lightnings and discomfited them . . . He delivered me from my strong enemy” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/18-4.htm" title="The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.">Psalm 18:4-19</a>). It is a solemn thought that we may send up prayers, and the answer may come down a judgment; for often it is only through judgment that true loving-kindness can make her way.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The seventh seal is opened. There was profound silence in heaven for a space; all was quiet in the church, for whenever the church on earth cries through oppression, that cry reaches up to heaven; or it is a silence of expectation. Trumpets were given to the angels, who were to sound them. The Lord Jesus is the High Priest of the church, having a golden censer, and much incense, fulness of merit in his own glorious person. Would that men studied to know the fulness that is in Christ, and endeavoured to be acquainted with his excellency. Would that they were truly persuaded that Christ has such an office as that of Intercessor, which he now performs with deep sympathy. No prayers, thus recommended, was ever denied hearing and acceptance. These prayers, thus accepted in heaven, produced great changes upon earth. The Christian worship and religion, pure and heavenly in its origin and nature, when sent down to earth and conflicting with the passions and worldly projects of sinful men, produced remarkable tumults, here set forth in prophetical language, as our Lord himself declared, Lu 12:49.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the angel took the censer - <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>. This is a new symbol, designed to furnish a new representation of future events. By the former it had been shown that there would be much prayer offered; by this it is designed to show that, notwithstanding the prayer that would be offered, great and fearful calamities would come upon the earth. This is symbolized by casting the censer upon the earth, as if the prayers were not heard any longer, or as if prayer were now in vain.<p>And filled it with fire of the altar - An image similar to this occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, where the man clothed in linen is commanded to go between the wheels under the cherub, and fill his hands with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and to scatter them over the city as a symbol of its destruction. Here the coals are taken, evidently, from the altar of sacrifice. Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>. On these coals no incense was placed, but they were thrown at once to the earth. The new emblem, therefore, is the taking of coals, and scattering them abroad as a symbol of the destruction that was about to ensue.<p>And cast it into the earth - Margin, upon. The margin expresses undoubtedly the meaning. The symbol, therefore, properly denoted that fearful calamities were about to come upon the earth. Even the prayers of saints did not prevail to turn them away, and now the symbol of the scattered coals indicated that terrible judgments were about to come upon the world.<p>And there were voices - Sounds, noises. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>. The order is not the same here as there, but lightnings, thunderings, and voices are mentioned in both.<p>And an earthquake - <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>. This is a symbol of commotion. It is not necessary to look for a literal fulfillment of it, anymore than it is for literal "voices," "lightnings," or "thunderings." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. cast it into the earth&#8212;that is, unto the earth: the hot coals off the altar cast on the earth, symbolize God's fiery judgments about to descend on the Church's foes in answer to the saints' incense-perfumed prayers which have just ascended before God, and those of the martyrs.

In answer to the prayers and longings of the saints (Renan, 393), God at last visits the impenitent pagan world with a series of catastrophes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/8-8.htm" title="And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;...">Revelation 8:8-9</a>., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm" title="And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.">Revelation 9:4</a>), which herald the end and also give (though in vain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/9-20.htm" title="And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:...">Revelation 9:20-21</a>) an opportunity for repentance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne....">Revelation 8:3-5</a>. This episode (in dumb show) of angel and incense, though apparently isolated, is an overture for the series of judgments, of which the successive trumpet-blasts are precursors. The prayers of all the saints, which, like those of the martyrs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm" title="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10</a>, crave punishment upon God’s enemies throughout the earth, are supported and reinforced by the ministry of this angel, and answered at once by the succession of incidents beginning with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-5.htm" title="And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunder, and lightning, and an earthquake.">Revelation 8:5</a>. This object of Christian prayers, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the final crisis, when Christ returns to crush his enemies and inaugurate his reign, pervaded early Christianity as a whole. At special periods of intolerable persecution, it assumed under the stress of antagonism as here a more sensuous and plastic form than the ordinary consciousness of the church would have been usually disposed to cherish; yet the common prayer of the church in any case was for the speedy end of the world (<span class="greekheb">ἐλθέτω χάρις καὶ παρελθέτω ὁ κόσμος οὗτος</span> Did. x.). In Apoc. Mos. (tr. Conybeare, <span class="ital">Jewish Quart. Rev.</span>, 1895, 216–235) 33, when the angels intercede for Adam at his ascension to heaven, they take golden censers and offer incense; whereupon smoke overshadows the very firmament. The intercession of angels on behalf of the saints, a result of their function as guardians, goes back to post-exilic Judaism with its inarticulated conception of the angels as helpful to mankind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-1.htm" title="Call now, if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the saints will you turn?">Job 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm" title="If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:">Job 33:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?">Zechariah 1:12</a>); subsequently the idea developed into a belief that the prayers of the pious won special efficacy as they were presented to God by angels such as Gabriel, Raphael, Michael, or the seven archangels (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Tobit, <span class="ital">loc. cit.</span>; Slav. En. vii. 5; En. ix. 2–11, xv. 2, xl. 6, xlvii. 2, xcix. 3, 16, civ. 1). In Christianity this rôle was naturally absorbed by Christ, who alone ratified and inspired his people’s supplications. But the old belief evidently lingered in pious circles of Jewish Christianity (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Test. Leviticus 3, 5), side by side with a complete acceptance of Christ’s heavenly function. The latter did not immediately or universally wither up such survivals of the older faith; popular religion tended then as now to be wider at several points than its theoretical principles (as in Origen, <span class="ital">Cels.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-4.htm" title="And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.">Revelation 8:4</a>; and Tertull. <span class="ital">de Orat.</span> xii.). Plato, in <span class="ital">Sympos.</span> 202 E., makes the <span class="greekheb">δαίμονες</span> present men’s prayers and offerings to the gods, and mediate the latter’s commands and recompence to men (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Philo, <span class="ital">de Somniis</span>, i. 22, and on i. 1). See further <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9</a>, for a similar state of matters in primitive Christianity with regard to the corresponding function of Jewish angels as intermediaries of revelation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">and cast it</span>] Probably cast the censer full of burning coals, but possibly only “scattered the fire,” as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-37.htm" title="Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.">Numbers 16:37</a>. The meaning must be, to represent the same instrument as obtaining God’s mercy on His people, and executing His vengeance on His enemies: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.

We have similar signs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm" title="And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightning, and voices, and thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail.">Revelation 11:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-18.htm" title="And there were voices, and thunders, and lightning; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were on the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.">Revelation 16:18</a>, when the series of the seven trumpets and the seven vials respectively are ended: hence perhaps it is here rather than earlier that we are to look for the conclusion of the visions of the seven seals.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth;</span> <span class="accented">taketh the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth</span> (Revised Version). The angel now returns to the altar of burnt offering, whence he takes fire, which he casts upon the earth.
