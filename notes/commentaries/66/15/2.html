Such is the appearance of this glass-like sea now that the angels of the plagues are going forth.<p>But the seer saw more than this fire-flushed sea. He saw also those that are victorious over the wild beast. These he describes (such is the literal translation) as <span class= "ital">those who conquer out of the wild beast, </span>&c.; they come off conquerors out of the struggle, and they escape from the temptation to worship his image and wear the badge of his service: they “escape victorious from” his image and from his mark.

The life which has been a discord to the world rises into true music before God; those who will make their life a melody must take it first as a conflict. The harps they hold are called harps of God, not merely because they are dedicated to Him. but because they are truly God’s. All the most glorious and noble things in nature were named God’s: the lofty trees were “trees of God “; the high-piled mountains were “mountains of God “; so also the harps which strike forth the richest music are “harps of God.” Nor is this a mere phrase to be considered as equivalent to very great or very glorious; great and glorious the trees, hills, and harps are, but only a prosaic or a profane mind can be satisfied with such a naked equivalent. The godly saw the hand of God in these things; and St. John knows that the noblest melody in the ears of God is the noble life of faith, suffering, and love. The power of such a life is in God, not in itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm" title="I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.">John 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), and the music of such a life is music which God makes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7-10</a>), drawing the sweetest tones from the strings which are smitten with pain and sorrow; and as its life’s music is God-taught, so does its song of triumph sound from a harp not its own, but God’s. If our power to sing in trial here a song worthy of God is only found in God, so will the songs of heaven be sweet only in Him, for those who dwell there shall be all taught of Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/revelation/15.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Revelation<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE SONG OF MOSES AND THE LAMB</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God....">Revelation 15:2-3</a>The form of this vision is moulded partly by the circumstances of the Seer, and partly by reminiscences of Old Testament history. As to the former, it can scarcely be an accident that the Book of the Revelation abounds with allusions to the sea. We are never far from the music of its waves, which broke around the rocky Patmos where it was written. And the ‘sea of glass mingled with fire’ is but a photograph of what John must have seen on many a still morning, when the sunrise came blushing over the calm surface; or on many an evening when the wind dropped at sundown, and the sunset glow dyed the watery plain with a fading splendor. - Nor is the allusion to Old Testament history less obvious. We cannot but recognize the reproduction, with modifications, of that scene when Moses and his ransomed people looked upon the ocean beneath which their oppressors lay, and lifted up their glad thanksgivings. So here, by anticipation, in the solemn pause before the judgment goes forth, there are represented the spirits that have been made wise by conquest, as gathered on the bank of that steadfast ocean, lifting up as of old a hymn of triumphant thankfulness over destructive judgments, and blending the song of Moses and of the Lamb, in testimony of the unity of spirit which runs through all the manifestations of God’s character from the beginning to the end. Ever His judgments are right; ever the purpose of His most terrible things is that men may know Him, and may love Him; and ever they who see deepest into the mysteries, and understand most truly the realities of the universe will have praise springing to their lips for all that God hath done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Notice the Triumphant Choir. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘I saw them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image, and over the number of his name.’ Now I am not going to plunge into Apocalyptic discussions. It is no part of my business now either to ask or answer the question as to whether this Beast of the Revelation is a person or a tendency. I do not care, for my present purpose, whether, supposing it to be a person, an embodiment of certain tendencies, it is a person in the past or in the future; whether it was a veiled designation of the Emperor Nero, or whether it is a prophecy of some yet unborn human embodiment of transcendent wickedness. The question that I would ask is rather this, - Whoever the beast is, what makes him a beast? And if we will think about that, we may get some good out of it. What is the bestial element in him, whoever he be? And the answer is not far to find - Godless selfishness, that is ‘the mark of the beast.’ Wherever a human nature is self-centered, God-forgetting, and, therefore, God opposing {for whoever forgets God defies Him}, that nature has gone down below humanit3% and has touched the lower level of the brutes. Men are so made as that they must either rise to the level of God or certainly go down to that of the animal. And wherever you see men living by their own fancies, for their own pleasure, in forgetfulness and neglect of the sweet and mystic bonds that should knit them to God, there you see the image of the beast and the number of his name.’ <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But besides that godless selfishness, we may point to simple animalism as literally the mark of the beast. He who lives not by conscience and by faith, but by fleshly inclination and sense, lowers himself to the level of the instinctive brute-life, and beneath it, because he refuses to obey faculties which they do not possess, and what is nature in them is degradation in us. Look at the unblushing sensuality which marks many ‘respectable people’ nowadays. Look at the foul fleshliness of much of popular art and poetry. Look at the way in which pure animal passion, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye, and the love of good things to eat, and plenty to drink, is swaying and destroying men and women by the thousand among us. Look at the temptations that lie along every street in our great cities, for every young man, after dusk. Look at the thin veneer of culture over the ugliest lust. Scratch the gentleman, and you find the satyr. Is it much of an exaggeration, in view of the facts of English life to-day, to say that all the world wonders after and worships this beast? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Further, notice that to escape from the power of the beast it is needful to fight one’s way out. The language of my text is remarkably significant. This Apocalyptic writer does not mind about grammar or smoothness so long as he can express his ideas; and he uses a form of speech here that makes the hair of grammatical purists stand on end, because it vigorously expresses his thought. He calls these triumphant choristers ‘conquerors out of the beast,’ which implies that victory over him is an escape from a dominion in which the conquerors, before their victory, were held. They have fought their way, as it were, out of the land of bondage, and, like revolted slaves, have won their liberty, and marched forth triumphant. The allusion to Israel’s exodus is probable. ‘Egypt was glad when they departed.’ So the bondsmen of this new Pharaoh recover freedom by conflict, and the fruit of their victory is entire escape from the tyrant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That victory is possible. The Apocalypse shows us that there are two opposing Powers - this said ‘beast’ on the one side, and ‘the Lamb’ on the other. In the Seer’s vision these two divide the world between them. That is to say, Jesus Christ has conquered the bestial tendencies of our nature, the selfish godlessness which is apt to cast its spells and weave its chains over us all. The Warrior-Lamb, singular and incongruous as the combination sounds, is the Victor. He conquers because He is the Lamb of sacrifice; He conquers because He is the Lamb of innocence; He conquers because He is the Lamb of meekness, the gentle and, therefore, the all-victorious. By Christ we conquer. Through faith, which lays hold on His power and victory, we too may conquer. ‘This is the victory which overcometh the world, even our faith.’ <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Young men and women, may I make my appeal specially to you? Do not let yourselves be led away captives, like cattle to the shambles, by the fascinations and seductions of this poor, fleeting present. Keep your heel on the neck of the animal that is within you; take care of that selfish godlessness into which we all are tempted to fall. Listen to the trumpet-call that ought to stir your hearts, and summons you to freedom and to victory through the blood of the Lamb. And by humbly clasping Him as your Sacrifice, your Leader, and your Power, enroll yourselves amongst those who, in His own good time, shall come victorious out from the beast and from his image. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Still further, notice the position of this victorious chorus. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and they stand on the sea of glass.’ Of course the propriety of the image, as well as the force of the original language, suggests at once that by ‘on the sea of glass’ here, we must understand, on the firm bank by its side. As Moses and the ransomed hosts stood on the shore of the Red Sea, so these conquerors are represented as standing on the safe beach, and looking out upon this sea of glass mingled with fire, which, calm, crystal, clear, stable, and yet shot through and through with the red lines of retributive judgment, sleeps above the buried oppressors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe that besides its picturesque appropriateness and its historical allusion, this sea of glass has a distinct symbolical meaning. "We find it appearing also in the great vision in the fourth chapter, where the Seer beholds the normal and ideal order of the universe, which is - the central throne, the ‘Lamb that was slain’ in the interspace between the Throne and the creatures as mediator; and round about, the four living beings, who represent the fullness of creation, and the four and-twenty elders, who represent the Church in the Old and the New Covenants as one whole. Then follows, ‘before the Throne was a sea of glass,’ which cannot be any part of the material creation, and seems to have but one explanation, and that is that it means the aggregate of the Divine dealings. ‘Thy judgments are a mighty deep.’ Oh! the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God; how unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out.’ Such a signification fits precisely our present passage, for the sea here represents that beneath which the tyrant lies buried for evermore. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That great ocean of the judgment of God is crystalline-clear though deep. Does it seem so to us? Ah I we stand before the mystery of God’s dealings, often bewildered, and not seldom reluctant to submit. The perplexity arising from their obscurity is often almost torture, and sometimes leads men into Atheism, or something like it. And yet here is the assurance that that sea is crystal clear, and that if we cannot look to its lowest depths, that is not because there is any mud or foulness there, but partly because the light from above fails before it reaches the abysses, and partly because our eyes are uneducated to search its depths. In itself it is transparent, and it rises and falls without mire or dirt,’ like the blue Mediterranean on the marble cliffs of the Italian coast. If it is clear as far as the eye can see, let us trust that beyond the reach of the eye the clearness is the same. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And it is a crystal ocean as being calm. They who stand there have gotten the victory and bear the image of the Master. By reason of their conquest and by reason of their sympathy with Him they see that what to us, tossing upon its surface, appears such a troubled and tempestuous ocean, as calm and still. As from some height, looked down upon, the ocean seems a watery plain, and all the agitation of the billows has subsided into a gentle ripple on the surface, so to them looking down upon the sea that brought them thither, it is quiet - and their vision, not ours, is the true one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is a ‘sea of glass mingled with fire.’ Divine acts of retribution as it were flash through it, if I may so say, like those streaks of red that are seen in Venice glass, or like some ocean smitten upon the one side of every wave by a fiery sunlight, while the other side of each is dark. So through that great depth of God’s dealings there flashes the fire of retribution. They who have conquered the animal, the godless self, see into the meaning and the mercifulness of God’s dealings with the world; and we here, in the measure in which we have become victors over the rude animalism and the more subtle selfishness that tend to rule us all, and in the measure in which we bear the image of Jesus Christ, and therefore have come into sympathy with Him, may come to discern with some clearer understanding, and to trust with more unfaltering faith, the righteousness and the mercy of all that God shall do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, notice the occasion of the song, and the song itself. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘They sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb.’ The Song of Moses was a song of triumph over destructive judgment; the Song of the Lamb, says the text, is set on the same key. The one broad, general lesson to be drawn from this, is one on which I have no time to touch, viz., the essential unity, in spite of all superficial diversities, of the revelation of God in the Old Covenant by law and miracle and retributive acts, and the revelation of God in the New Covenant by the Cross and Passion of Jesus Christ. Men pit the Old Testament against the New; the God of the Old Testament against the God of the New. They sometimes tell us that there is antagonism. Modern teachers are wanting us to deny that the Old is the foreshadowing of the New, and the New the fulfilment of the Old. My text asserts, in opposition to all such errors, the fruitful principle of the fundamental unity of the two; and bids us find in the one the blossom and in the other the fruit, and declares that the God who brought the waters of the ocean over the oppressors is the God that has mercy upon all, in Jesus Christ, His dying Son. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And there is another principle here, upon which I need not do more than touch, for I have already anticipated much that might have been said about it, and that is the perfect harmony of the retributive acts of God’s destructive dealings in this world, and the highest conception of His love and mercy which the gospel brings us. ‘When the wicked perish,’ says one of the old proverbs, ‘there is shouting.’ And so there ought to be. When some hoary oppression that has been deceiving mankind for centuries, with its instruments and accomplices, is swept off the face of the earth, the more men have entered into the meaning of Jesus Christ’s mission and work, and the more they feel the pitying indignation which they ought to feel at seeing men led away by evil, and made miserable by oppression, the more they will rejoice. God’s dealings are meant to manifest His character and that in order that all men may know and love Him. We may, therefore, be sure, and keep firm hold of the confidence, that whatever He doeth, however the methods may seem to vary, comes from one unalterable and fixed motive, and leads to one unalterable and certain end. The motive is His own love; the end the glory of His Name, in the love and knowledge of men whose life and blessedness depend on their knowing and loving Him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, dear friends, do not let us be too swift in saying that this, that, and the other thing are inconsistent with the highest conceptions of the Divine character. I believe, as heartily as any man can believe, that God has put His witness in our consciences and minds, and that all His dealings will comply with any test that man’s reason and man’s conscience and man’s heart can subject them to. Only we have not got all the materials; we look at half -finished work; our eyes are not quite so educated as that we can pronounce infallibly, on seeing a small segment of a circle, what are its diameter and its sweep. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I am always suspicious of that rough-and-ready way of settling questions about God’s revelation, when a man says: I cannot accept this or that because it contradicts my conception of the Divine nature.’ Unless you are quite sure that your conceptions are infallibly accurate, unless you deny the possibility of their being educated, you must admit that agreement with them is but a leaden rule. And it seems to me a good deal wiser, and more accordant with the modesty which becomes us, to be cautious in pronouncing what does or does not befit God to do, and, until we reach that loftier point of vision, where being higher up we can see deeper down, to say ‘the Judge of all the earth must do right. If He does this, then it is right.’ At any rate let us lay hold of the plain truth: ‘O Lord! Thou preservest man and beast,’ and then we may venture to say, ‘Thy judgments are a mighty deep,’ and beneath that deepest depth, as the roots of the hills beneath the ocean, is God’s righteousness, which is like the great mountains. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last thought that I would suggest is that, according to the teaching of my text, we may take that old, old story of the ransomed slaves and the baffled oppressor and the Divine intervention and the overwhelming ocean, as prophecy full of radiant hope for the world. That is how it is used here. Pharaoh is the beast, the Red Sea is this ‘sea of glass mingled with fire,’ the ransomed Israelites are those who have conquered their way out of the dominion of the beast, and the song of Moses and of the Lamb is a song parallel to the cadences of the ancient triumphant chorus, and celebrating the annihilation of that power which drew the world away from God. So we may believe that as Israel stood on the sands, and saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore, humanity will one day, delivered from all its bestiality and its selfishness, lift up a song of thanksgiving to the conquering King who has drowned its enemies in the depths of His own righteous judgments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And as for the world, so for individuals. If you take the Beast for your Pharaoh and your task-master, you will ‘sink’ with him ‘like lead in the mighty waters.’ If you take the Lamb for your sacrifice and your King, He will break the bonds from off your arms, and lift the yoke from your neck, and lead you all your lives long; and you will stand at last, when the eternal morning breaks, and see its dawn touch with golden light the calm ocean, beneath which your oppressors lie buried for ever, and will lift up glad thanksgivings to Him who has washed you from your sins in His own blood, and made you victors over ‘the beast, and his image, and the number of his name.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God....">Revelation 15:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire </span>— It was before <span class="ital">clear as crystal, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>,) but is now <span class="ital">mingled with fire</span> — Emblematical of the judgments whereby God’s enemies were about to be devoured; <span class="ital">and them that had </span>gained — Or <span class="ital">were gaining, </span>as <span class="greekheb">τους νικωντας </span>rather means; <span class="ital">the victory over the beast and his image </span>— And not submitted to his tyranny or religion, having steadfastly refused, though at the expense of their property, liberty, and lives, amidst so many who were devoted to him, to receive <span class="ital">his mark, and the number of his name </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Expressions which seem to mean nearly the same thing; standing <span class="ital">on the sea of glass </span>— Which was before the throne; <span class="ital">having the harps of God —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Given by him, and appropriated to his praise. <span class="ital">And they sing, </span>&c. — Like unto the people of Israel after their deliverance and escape out of Egypt, when, having passed through the Red sea, they stood on the shore; and, seeing their enemies overwhelmed with the waters, sung the triumphant song of Moses. So these, having passed through the fiery trials of this world, stand on a sea of glass, and, seeing the vials ready to be poured out upon their enemies, sing a song of triumph for the manifestation of the divine judgments, which is called the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb, because the words are, in a great measure, taken from the song of Moses and other parts of the Old Testament, and applied in a Christian sense; but chiefly because Moses was the minister and representative of the Jewish Church, as Christ is of the church universal: therefore it is also termed, <span class="ital">the song of the Lamb. Saying, Great and marvellous are thy works</span> — We acknowledge and know that all thy works, in and toward all the creatures, are great and wonderful; <span class="ital">just and true are thy ways </span>— With all the children of men, good and evil. <span class="ital">Who shall not fear thee, O Lord </span>— Stand in awe of thee, revere thy justice and thy power, and fear to offend thee; <span class="ital">and glorify thy name </span>— Honour and praise, love and serve thee; <span class="ital">for thou only art holy </span>— And in thy presence the holiness of all other beings disappears, as utterly unworthy to be mentioned.

Accordingly, in the 137th Psalm, that clause, <span class="ital">for his mercy endureth for ever, </span>is subjoined to the thanksgiving for his works of vengeance, as well as for his delivering the righteous. <span class="ital">For all nations shall come and worship before thee </span>— Shall serve thee as their king, and confide in thee as their Saviour with reverential joy: a glorious testimony this to the future conversion of all the heathen. The Christians are now a little flock; and they who do not worship God, an immense multitude.

As the measure of Babylon's sins was filled up, it finds the full measure of Divine wrath. While believers stand in this world, in times of trouble, as upon a sea of glass mingled with fire, they may look forward to their final deliverance, while new mercies call forth new hymns of praise. The more we know of God's wonderful works, the more we shall praise his greatness as the Lord God Almighty, the Creator and Ruler of all worlds; but his title of Emmanuel, the King of saints, will make him dear to us.

See the notes on that passage. The sea of glass here means a sea clear, pellucid, like glass: an expanse that seemed to be made of glass. There it was entirely clear; here it is mingled with fire.<p>Mingled with fire - That is, a portion of the sea was red like fire. It was not all clear and pellucid, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, but it was as it were a tesselated expanse, composed in part of what seemed to be glass, and in part of a material of a red or fiery color. In the former case <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, the emblem was designed to represent the pure worship of heaven without reference to any other symbolic design, and hence, the sea is wholly clear and pellucid; here, in connection with the purpose of furnishing an appropriate symbol of the divine majesty, there is united the idea of punishment on the foes of God, represented by the fiery or red color. If it is proper, from conjecture, to suggest the meaning of this as an emblem, it would be that the foundation - the main element - of all the divine dealings is justice or holiness - represented by the portion of the sea that seemed to be glass; and that there was, in this case, intermingled with that, the image of wrath or anger - represented by the portion that was fiery or red. The very sight of the pavement, therefore, on which they stood when worshipping God, would keep before their minds impressive views of his character and dealings.<p>And them that had gotten the victory over the beast - <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11</a>. That is, they who had gained a victory in times of persecution and temptation; or they whom the "beast" had not been able, by arts or arms, to subdue. The persons referred to here, I suppose, are those who in the long dominion of the papal power, and amidst all its arts and corruptions - its threats and persecutions - had remained steadfast in the truth, and who might thus be said to have gained a victory - for such victories of piety, virtue, and truth, amidst the corrupting influences of sin and error, and the intimidations of power, are the most important that are gained in this world.<p>And over his image - See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14-15</a>. The meaning is, that they had not been led to apostatize by the dread of the power represented here by the "image of the beast." In all the attempts of that power to subdue them - to intimidate them - to induce them to give up their attachment to the truth as it is in Jesus - they had remained steadfast in the faith, and had triumphed.<p>And over his mark - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>. Over all the attempts of the beast to fix his mark upon them, or to designate them as his own.<p>And over the number of his name - See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-17.htm">Revelation 13:17-18</a>. Over all the attempts to fix upon them that mysterious number which expressed his name. The general sense is, that in times of general error and corruption; when the true friends of Christ were exposed to persecution; when every effort was made to induce them to become the followers of the "beast," and to yield to the corrupt system represented by the "beast," they remained unmoved, and adhered firmly to the truth. The number of such in the aggregate was not small; and with great beauty and propriory they are here represented as rejoicing and giving thanks to God on the overthrow of that corrupt and formidable power.<p>Stand on the sea of glass - That is, before God. They are now seen in heaven, redeemed and triumphant.<p>Having the harps of God - Harps that pertained to the worship of God; harps to be employed in his praise.

So the preposition, Greek, "epi," with the accusative case, is used for at, Re 3:20. It has a pregnant sense: "standing" implies rest, Greek "epi" with the accusative case implies motion "towards." Thus the meaning is, Having come TO the sea, and now standing AT it. In Mt 14:26, where Christ walks on the sea, the Greek oldest manuscripts have the genitive, not the accusative as here. Allusion is made to the Israelites standing on the shore at the Red Sea, after having passed victoriously through it, and after the Lord had destroyed the Egyptian foe (type of Antichrist) in it. Moses and the Israelites' song of triumph (Ex 15:1) has its antitype in the saints' "song of Moses and the Lamb" (Re 15:3). Still English Version is consistent with good Greek, and the sense will then be: As the sea typifies the troubled state out of which the beast arose, and which is to be no more in the blessed world to come (Re 21:1), so the victorious saints stand on it, having it under their feet (as the woman had the moon, see on [2726]Re 12:1); but it is now no longer treacherous wherein the feet sink, but solid like glass, as it was under the feet of Christ, whose triumph and power the saints now share. Firmness of footing amidst apparent instability is thus represented. They can stand, not merely as victorious Israel at the Red Sea, and as John upon the sand of the shore, but upon the sea itself, now firm, and reflecting their glory as glass, their past conflict shedding the brighter luster on their present triumph. Their happiness is heightened by the retrospect of the dangers through which they have passed. Thus this corresponds to Re 7:14, 15.<p>harps of God&#8212;in the hands of these heavenly virgins, infinitely surpassing the timbrels of Miriam and the Israelitesses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This <span class="bld">sea of glass</span> (as our learned More thinks) hath either an allusion to the <span class="ital">sea of glass like unto crystal, </span> reflected upon by the <span class="ital">lamps of fire burning before the throne, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-5.htm" title="And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunder and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.">Revelation 4:5</a>,6</span>, or to the waters of the Red Sea congealed (while the Israelites passed over) reflected upon by the pillar of fire.

Not baptism, but rather the blood of Christ, which may be compared to a sea, for its abundant virtue and efficacy in cleansing from all sin; and to a sea "of glass", since in it are clearly seen free justification, full pardon, peace and reconciliation; and may be said to be "mingled with fire", being attended in the application of it with the Spirit of God, whose gifts and graces are sometimes signified by fire: and so, according to others, this sea may represent the pure church of God, as washed in the blood of the Lamb; compared to a sea for the multitude of which it consists, and to a sea of glass, because of the transparency and clearness of its principles and practices, and may be said to be mingled with the fire of love and zeal: most interpreters understand it of the world, which is like a sea for the multitude of its inhabitants; and sometimes to a troubled one, because of the restlessness and disquietude of the wicked in it; but here it is like a sea of glass, for the quiet, and peace, and rest it shall be in at this time; though it is commonly said to be like such a sea, partly because all things are manifest, and open to an omniscient God; and partly because of its outward splendour, and the brittleness, frailty, and transitoriness of it; and to be mixed with fire, either because of the light of the Gospel, and the operation of the Spirit in the hearts of some that are in it, or because of the afflictions and persecutions the saints in it; though it seems best of all to understand it of the Gospel, as in See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; and which may be said to be mingled with fire, either because of the powerful and clear demonstration of the Spirit that attends it to the minds of many, or that heat of persecution which is raised by it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-49.htm">Luke 12:49</a> or rather it denotes the purity of the Gospel in those times, its general spread, and the great zeal and fervour of the professors of it, since persecution will now be at an end. <p>And them that had gotten the victory over the beast; over antichrist, signified the beast, that rose up out of the sea, and out of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a> and which are the same, and were but one, though in different forms, as from hence appears: the beast first overcame the saints, by slaying of them; and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony, by preaching and professing the Gospel, by their close and constant adherence to it, and by dying for it: <p>and over his image; caused by him to be made to the first beast; and is no other than the Popish religion, which bears a resemblance to Paganism; and which the saints may be said to get the victory over, by standing out against it, opposing and refuting it, not giving into it, but bearing their testimony against it: <p>and over his mark; refusing to receive it either in their forehead, or in their right hand; that is, either to swear allegiance to him, or profess his religion. This clause is wanting in the Alexandrian copy, Vulgate Latin, Syriac. Arabic, and Ethiopic versions: <p>and over the number his name; that is, they would not own his supremacy and authority, nor embrace his doctrines, nor obey his orders, nor be reckoned his followers in any form or shape; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-15.htm">Revelation 13:15</a>. These conquerors John saw <p>stand on the sea of glass; which, if applied to the blood of Christ, shows that these confessors were purified by it, and were more than conquerors through it; that they were come out of great tribulation, and had washed their garments, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; and were just come up from the washing, and stood upon, or rather by, or "near the sea", as the Arabic version renders it, in allusion to the priests at the molten sea, in the temple: but if the world is meant by the sea, their standing upon it designs their victory and triumph over it by faith, their having it under their feet, and their contempt of it; but rather, since the Gospel is intended, it may denote their solid standing upon the doctrines of it, the foundation of the apostles and prophets, and their steadfast continuance in them, and faithful abiding by them, whereby they got the victory over antichrist: <p>having the harps of God: their hearts in an excellent frame, tuned and disposed by God, to sing his praise, and set forth his glory; having them filled with spiritual joy and gladness, and with great thankfulness, on account of their victory, the happy state of Christ's church, and the destruction of its enemies: the allusion is to the people of Israel, Moses and the men, and Miriam and the women with timbrels and dances standing on the sea shore, when the Egyptians were destroyed, singing the praises of God; as is still more manifest from the following verse. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> And I saw <span class="cverse3">{4}</span> as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and <span class="cverse3">{5}</span> them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, <i>and</i> over the number of his name, <span class="cverse3">{6}</span> stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</span><p>(3) There are two parts of the narration: one, the confession of the saints glorifying God, when they saw that preparation of the judgments of God, to Re 15:3,4, another the vocation, instruction, and confirmation of those instruments which God has ordained for the execution of his judgments, in Re 15:5-8.<p>(4) This part of the vision alludes to the sea or large vessel or brass, in which the priests washed themselves in the entrance of the temple: for in the entrance of the heavenly temple (as it is called) in Re 15:5, is said to have been a sea of glass, most luminous and clear to the commodity of choice mixed with fire, that is, as containing the treasury of the judgments of God, which he brings forth and dispenses according to his own pleasure: for out of the former, the priests were cleansed of old: and out of this the ungodly are destroyed now in Re 4:6.<p>(5) That is, the godly martyrs of Christ, who shall remain faithful even in miracles to that beast; see Re 13:17, 14:9,10<p>(6) Glorifying God, from the particular observation of the weapons and instruments of God's wrath, floating in the sea of glass.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God....">Revelation 15:2-4</a>.

It is not until at the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>, that, since by the first accurate expression recalling <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς θάλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑαλ</span>., an end is placed to all misunderstanding, it is expressly said, with a certain want of precision, <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τἡν θάλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ὑαλ</span>. That the addition <span class="greekheb">μεμιγμένην πυρί</span> cannot be referred here to any thing else than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>, follows likewise from the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>, which shows that the essential designation of what is meant lies in the words <span class="greekheb">θαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑαλιν</span>., while the <span class="greekheb">μεμιγμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πυρί</span> expresses a more special, although in this place a significant, side-reference. Because of the addition <span class="greekheb">μεμιγμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πυρί</span>, the false interpretations of <span class="greekheb">ὡς θάλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑαλίν</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>, appear here in new applications. Grot. understands here “the mass of Gentile Christians inflamed with love to God;” Coccejus, “the peace of the world, and the operation of the Holy Spirit in the world;” Calov., who refers the <span class="greekheb">θάλ</span>. to baptism, and the <span class="greekheb">πὺρ</span> to God’s wrath, interprets: “That grace will not be denied to penitents in the midst of the flames of Divine wrath;” Vitr. explains that the victors stand upon the firm ground of the truth illumined by the fire of Divine righteousness; the allusion to the lightning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-5.htm" title="And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunder and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.">Revelation 4:5</a>, Eichh. and De Wette interpret as meaning the atmosphere; Züll. and Ewald, the floor of heaven; while De Wette, Hengstenb., Ebrard, Stern,[3612] maintain a reference to the Red Sea, at which the children of Israel sang their song of praise. But it is just this passage[3613] which, because of its other contents, is adapted for furnishing the correct interpretation also for <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>. That which is like “a sea of glass,” by which[3614] the victors stand, designates, like the river of life,[3615] the eternal fulness of joy in God’s presence, with which the victors will be rewarded. But if, in this passage; the sea appears also as “<span class="ital">mingled with fire</span>,” thereby the unity of God’s saving grace and judging righteousness is designated in like manner; as already in the fundamental description of the glory of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm" title="And he that sat was to look on like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like to an emerald.">Revelation 4:3</a> sqq.,[3616] both points are harmoniously[3617] presented, and, as in general in prophecy concerning the end, both parts of the subject belong together.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοὺς νικῶντας</span>.

On the subject, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-7.htm" title="And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.">Revelation 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-15.htm" title="And he had power to give life to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.">Revelation 13:15</a> sqq, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΙΘΆΡΑς ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>.

It is not two songs that are designated;[3621] also no allusion whatever is made to the connection between prophecy and the gospel;[3622] altogether false is every explanation that does not acknowledge that the song immediately following, introduced by the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΈΓΟΝΤΕς</span></span></span>, is at the same time both the song of Moses[3623] and the song of the Lamb. But this does not mean the song wherein these former idol-worshippers declare their conversion to Moses and Jesus, or rather to “the God of these,”[3624] nor the song of Moses[3625] applied to Christ and the things of Christ;[3626] but the song which is composed alike by Moses and the Lamb, and is taught to the victors.[3627] By this the same view is significantly expressed, which appears in another way also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a> sqq., in combination with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a> sqq. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a>; viz.,[3628] that the essential unity of the O. and the N.

T. psalm tone, as what is in clear accord with the O.

But perhaps no more is meant than when we speak of a town lying “<span class="ital">on</span> the sea:” this is supported by the fact that Israel sung the song of Moses on the <span class="ital">shore</span>, after their passage. And the Greek preposition used, though naturally translated “on,” is the same as in the phrase “stand <span class="ital">at</span> the door” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">harps</span>] As <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:">Revelation 14:2</a> : though the harpers here are not the same as in the first place nor (probably) as in the second.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/revelation/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>. [172] <span class="greekheb">Νικῶντας ἐκ</span>) A phrase of rare occurrence; but that of Lycurgus, contra Leocr., is similar, <span class="greekheb">τί ποιῶν ἂν νίκην λάβοι παρὰ τῶν πολεμίων</span>.

See App. on this passage. In fact there are not three things spoken of: but <span class="ital">the name</span> of the beast, OR <span class="ital">the number</span> of his <span class="ital">name</span> (disjunctively), is the mark itself. <span class="ital">The mark</span> (“character”) is the genus: there are two species, <span class="ital">the name</span> of the beast, and <span class="ital">the number</span> of his <span class="ital">name</span>. Hence it is that <span class="ital">the mark</span> (“character,” <span class="ital">characterism</span>) of the beast is spoken of for the most part indefinitely: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-9.htm" title="And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,">Revelation 14:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-2.htm" title="And the first went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image.">Revelation 16:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm" title="And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.">Revelation 19:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm" title="And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark on their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.">Revelation 20:4</a>; but when used definitely, it is either <span class="ital">the mark</span> (“charagma,” <span class="ital">characteristic</span>) <span class="ital">of</span> his <span class="ital">name</span> separately, as ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-11.htm" title="And the smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.">Revelation 14:11</a>, or <span class="ital">the number of</span> his <span class="ital">name</span> separately, as here. For the one of these is included in the notion of the other: or at one time it is <span class="ital">the name of the beast</span>, at another, <span class="ital">the number of his name</span>, that more prevails. The preposition, <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>, is here used several times, as ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm" title="Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.">Revelation 18:20</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἑστῶτας ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν ὑαλίνην</span>, <span class="ital">standing at the sea of glass</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span> with an accusative, and with this very verb <span class="ital">of standing</span>, denotes either <span class="ital">above, on</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-11.htm" title="And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell on them which saw them.">Revelation 11:11</a>, Rev. 12:18 [Engl.
