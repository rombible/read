Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fifth, sardonyx - This word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The "name" is derived from "Sardis," a city in Asia Minor (notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>), and &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be;  onux, a nail - so named, according to Pliny, from the resemblance of its color to the flesh and the nail. It is a silicious stone or gem, nearly allied to the onyx. The color is a reddish yellow, nearly orange (Webster, Dictionary).<p>The sixth, sardius - This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It is also derived from "Sardis," and the name was probably given to the gem because it was found there. It is a stone of a blood-red or flesh color, and is commonly known as a "carnelian." It is the same as the sardine stone mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>. See the notes on that place.<p>The seventh, chrysolite - This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It is derived from &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  chrusos, "gold," and &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  lithos, "stone," and means "golden stone," and was applied by the ancients to all gems of a golden or yellow color, probably designating particularly the topaz of the moderns (Robinson, Lexicon). But in Webster's Dictionary it is said that its prevalent color is green. It is sometimes transparent. This is the "modern" chrysolite. The ancients undoubtedly understood by the name a "yellow" gem.<p>The eighth, beryl - This word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The beryl is a mineral of great hardness, and is of a green or bluish-green color. It is identical with the emerald, except in the color, the emerald having a purer and richer green color, proceeding from a trace of oxide of chrome. Prisms of beryl are sometimes found nearly two feet in diameter in the state of New Hampshire (Webster).<p>The ninth, a topaz - This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The topaz is a well-known mineral, said to be so called from "Topazos," a small island in the Arabian Gulf. It is generally of a yellowish color, and pellucid, but it is also found of greenish, bluish, or brownish shades.<p>The tenth, a chrysoprasus - This word &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  chrusoprasos does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It is derived from &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  chrusos, "gold," and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  prason, "a leek," and denotes a precious stone of greenish golden color, like a leek; that is, "apple-green passing into a grass-green" (Robinson, Lexicon). "It is a variety of quartz. It is commonly apple-green, and often extremely beautiful. It is translucent, or sometimes semi-transparent; its hardness little inferior to flint" (Webster, Dictionary).<p>The eleventh, a jacinth - The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It is the same word as "hyacinth" - &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  huakinthos - and denotes properly the well-known flower of that name, usually of a deep purple or reddish blue. Here it denotes a gem of this color. It is a red variety of "zircon." See Webster's Dictionary under the word "hyacinth."<p>The twelfth, an amethyst - This word, also, is found only in this place in the New Testament. It denotes a gem of a deep purple or violet color. The word is derived from &#x3b1;  a, the alpha privative ("not"), and &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;  methuo&#772;, to be intoxicated, because this gem was supposed to be an antidote against drunkenness. It is a species of quartz, and is used in jewelry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. sardonyx&#8212;a gem having the redness of the cornelian, and the whiteness of the onyx.<p>sardius&#8212;(See on [2744]Re 4:3).<p>chrysolite&#8212;described by Pliny as transparent and of a golden brightness, like our topaz: different from our pale green crystallized chrysolite.<p>beryl&#8212;of a sea-green color.<p>topaz&#8212;Pliny [37.32], makes it green and transparent, like our chrysolite.<p>chrysoprasus&#8212;somewhat pale, and having the purple color of the amethyst [Pliny, 37, 20, 21].<p>jacinth&#8212;The flashing violet brightness in the amethyst is diluted in the jacinth [Pliny, 37.41].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I cannot tell what to make of these <span class="ital">precious stones, </span> with which they are said to be <span class="ital">garnished, </span> unless it be their spiritual gifts and habits of grace; the various manifestations of the Holy Spirit given to the apostles to profit the church withal, with which they adorned the doctrine of the gospel, and won upon the pagan world, making themselves admirable in the eyes of men and women. Nor were it hard to descant upon these several sorts of stones, and to show of what graces they may be types: the <span class="ital">jasper, </span> of steadiness and constancy; the <span class="ital">sapphire, </span> of heavenly mindedness (it being a stone of the colour of the heavens); the <span class="ital">chalcedony, </span> of zeal; the <span class="ital">emerald</span> of vigour and liveliness; the <span class="ital">sardonyx, </span> (a stone of various colours), of various gifts and graces; the <span class="ital">sardius, </span> of courage and fortitude, and a readiness to shed their blood for Christ; the <span class="ital">chrysolyte, </span> of love, or wisdom, and knowledge; the <span class="ital">beryl, </span> of a quickness of sight and understanding; the <span class="ital">topaz, </span> of searching out Divine mysteries; the <span class="ital">chrysoprasus, </span> of gravity and severity; the <span class="ital">jacinth, </span> of spiritual joy, calmness, and serenity of mind; the <span class="ital">amethyst, </span> of sobriety and temperence. But it seems to me too great curiosity to philosophize so far upon the nature of these stones; take them together, they probably signify all the gifts and graces of the blessed apostles, by which the religion of the gospel was first commended, and made to appear lovely to the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The fifth, sardonyx,.... Which is partly of the sardian, and partly of the onyx stone, which resembles a man's nail, from whence it has its name; it is reddish, bordering on white; it may be thought to answer to the onyx in the breastplate, on which was written the name of Joseph. <p>The sixth, sardius; the same with the sardine stone, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a> of a blood colour, and what is commonly called a cornelian: it is found in Sardinia, from whence it has its name, and in Bohemia and Silesia, though those of Babylon are the best. This was Reuben's stone. <p>The seventh, chrysolite; a stone of a dusky green colour, with a cast of yellow; by its name it should have the colour of gold. Schroder says it is found in Bohemia, and that it is the same the moderns call the topaz. Some think it answers to "tarshish" in the breastplate, rendered "beryl", on which was the name of Asher. <p>The eighth, beryl; a stone of a pale green colour, thought to be the diamond of the ancients: it may answer to the "ligure" in the breastplate, which the Targum on Sol 5:14 calls "birla", and had the name of Dan on it. <p>The ninth, a topaz; a stone very hard and transparent, of a beautiful yellow, or gold colour: the topaz of Ethiopia was counted the best,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a>. Some say it is so called from the island "Topazus"; on this stone Simeon's name was engraven. <p>The tenth, a chrysoprasus; a stone of a green colour, inclining to that of gold, from whence it has its name; for this is the agate in the breastplate, which was Napthali's stone. <p>The eleventh, a jacinth; or "hyacinth": a stone of a purple, or violet colour, from whence it has its name; though what the moderns so call is of a deep reddish yellow, pretty near a flame colour. Zabulon's stone was the diamond. <p>The twelfth, an amethyst; a stone of a violet colour, bordering on purple: it has been thought a preservative from drunkenness, from whence it seems to have its name. On this stone was written the name of Gad. Agreeably to this account of John's, the Jews speak (n) of the tabernacle above being built on twelve precious stones; and sometimes they say (o), that the holy blessed God will found Jerusalem with ten kind of precious stones, and which they mention, and several of which are the same with these. <p>(n) Zohar in Gen. fol. 17. 2. &amp; in Exod. fol. 65. 4.

Pliny defines it as originally signifying a white mark in a sard, like the human nail (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be;) placed upon flesh, and both of them transparent. Onyx is called from the resemblance of its white and yellow veins to the shades in the human finger-nail.

The name was derived from an island in the Red Sea where the gem was first discovered. The stone is our peridot.
