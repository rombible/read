All nations and peoples flock within the walls: it is the echo of the ancient prophecies. “All kings shall fall down before Him: all nations shall serve Him.” The Church and kingdom of Christ increase without end; and all will cast their glory at His feet, and call Him blessed in whom all have been blessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-11.htm" title="Yes, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.">Psalm 72:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm" title="His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.">Psalm 72:17</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:22-27 Perfect and direct communion with God, will more than supply the place of gospel institutions. And what words can more full express the union and co-equality of the Son with the Father, in the Godhead? What a dismal world would this be, if it were not for the light of the sun! What is there in heaven that supplies its place? The glory of God lightens that city, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. God in Christ will be an everlasting Fountain of knowledge and joy to the saints in heaven. There is no night, therefore no need of shutting the gates; all is at peace and secure. The whole shows us that we should be more and more led to think of heaven as filled with the glory of God, and enlightened by the presence of the Lord Jesus. Nothing sinful or unclean, idolatrous, or false and deceitful, can enter. All the inhabitants are made perfect in holiness. Now the saints feel a sad mixture of corruption, which hinders them in the service of God, and interrupts their communion with him; but, at their entrance into the holy of holies, they are washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and presented to the Father without spot. None are admitted into heaven who work abominations. It is free from hypocrites, such as make lies. As nothing unclean can enter heaven, let us be stirred up by these glimpses of heavenly things, to use all diligence, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the nations of them which are saved - All the nations that are saved; or all the saved considered as nations.

In distinction from them that will be deceived by Satan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>. These are not all the nations of the world, which will be gathered before Christ, the Judge, for all will not be saved, there is a world that will be condemned; nor the Gentiles only, which shall come into the church state of the Jews when called, for that state is not here designed; and besides, all Israel shall be saved then; nor the living saints at Christ's coming, who shall have escaped, and are saved from the general conflagration; for these, with the raised ones, will be caught up together to Christ, and descend and dwell together on earth, and make one church state; but all the elect of God, both Jews and Gentiles, whom God has chosen, Christ has redeemed, and the Spirit has called out of all the nations of the earth: these are only saved ones; such are already saved, not only are determined to be saved, and for whom salvation is wrought out by Christ, and to whom it is applied at conversion, and who are representatively set down in heavenly places in Christ, and are already saved by hope and faith, and with respect to the certainty of salvation; all which may be said of saints in the present state; but these will be such, who will be actually and personally saved, will be in the full possession of salvation, enjoying all the blessings of it: they will be partakers of the first resurrection, and the glories of it: the tabernacle of God will be with them, they will be free from all sorrows and death, and will inherit all things: the Syriac version reads, "the nations that are saved"; who are redeemed and saved by Christ: this may teach us how to understand those phrases, which seem to favour general redemption, as all men, the world, the whole world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>. These words, "of them which are saved", are left out in the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, but are in all the copies. These nations are the inhabitants of this city, and they <p>shall walk in the light of it, which is Christ; they shall enjoy it; they shall have the light of life, and be partakers of the inheritance with the saints in light, and that continually: they shall not only come to it, but continue in it, and walk at it, and by the light of it: the walk of these will be different from the walk of saints now, who walk by faith, and not by sight; but these shall walk by sight, enjoying the beatific vision of God, and the Lamb. The Jews say (b), that Jerusalem, in time to come, will be made a lamp to the nations of the world,  , "and they shall walk in its light", or by the light of it, which is the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a> "the Gentiles shall come to thy light"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a><p>and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it; by whom may be meant either mystically all the saints, who will be kings as well as priests unto God, and will reign as such with Christ in this state, will cast their crowns at his feet, and give him all the honour and glory; or literally, the kings of the earth, who shall have relinquished antichrist, hated the whore, and burnt her with fire, and who will have been nursing fathers in the spiritual reign; or rather all good kings that ever have been in the earth: not that they will be kings of the earth at this time, for now all rule, authority, and power, will be put down; nor will any worldly riches, honour, and glory, be brought by them into this state, nor will they be needed in it; but it is to be understood of who have been kings on earth, though not of their having brought earthly riches and grandeur into the interest and churches of Christ; as David gave much towards the building of the temple, which was begun and finished by King Solomon his son, and as Constantine greatly enriched and aggrandized the church when he became emperor; but the sense seems to be this, that such who have been Christian kings on earth will prefer the happiness of this state to all their riches and greatness here; and that could all the glory of the kings of the earth be put together, it would not equal, but be greatly inferior to the glory of the new Jerusalem; Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of the inhabitants of this place; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a> besides, these shall do all homage, and submit to Christ the King of kings in the midst of the church, which may be meant by "glory" and "honour". <p>(b) Yalkut Simeoni, par. 2. fol. 56. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/revelation/21.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-24.htm" title="And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it....">Revelation 21:24-27</a>. The men who enter into the city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The description is based throughout upon O. T. prophecies,[4359] so that it definitely marks how the mystery of God, which He had long since promised through the prophets, finds then its fulfilment.[4360] Hereby the <span class="ital">future</span> expression, now employed by John, is explained, while the aor., written besides in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm" title="And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.">Revelation 21:23</a><span class="ital"> b</span>, reports what has been beheld.[4361] In the tone and language of the ancient prophets, John describes the people who are to find entrance into the future city. In general, as has been said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm" title="And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.">Revelation 21:27</a>, in a decisive way, they are only such as are written in the book of life;[4362] but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-24.htm" title="And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it....">Revelation 21:24-26</a>, the Gentiles are expressly designated as those who, according to the ancient prophecies, are to find admission into the city. Thus by this statement, derived from the ancient prophetical declarations, the ideas of those expositors are not justified who conceive of the “heathen” and “kings,” as dwelling outside of the city,[4363] or who even attempt to determine what had been the moral condition, during their earthly life, of the heathen admitted now into the new Jerusalem.[4364] The essentially parallel description, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a> sqq., leads to the fact that believers from the heathen are to be regarded as entitled to an abode in the new Jerusalem; but the peculiar character of the description is conditioned by the O. T. prototypes, upon which John depends, although in its perspective, that which occurs in the earthly period of the Messianic time—as the conversion of the heathen, which is represented by the heathen coming to the earthly Jerusalem, and bringing presents—does not appear definitely separated from that which, to N. T. prophecy, having the first appearance of the Lord back of it, lies only on the other side of the second coming of the Lord. Altogether inapplicable is the remark made in critical interests,[4365] that the writer of the Apocalypse announces his anti-Pauline-Judaizing view, by making the distinction between heathen and Jews continue, even at the completion of the kingdom of God, in opposition to <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>. It is, indeed, directly stated how the natural distinction is <span class="ital">no longer</span> applicable, since the heathen, just as the Jews, receive full citizenship in the new Jerusalem, and, in like manner, participate in the blessed glory of the holy city. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm" title="In the middle of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.">Revelation 22:2</a>. Emphasis on works also in the Apoc.[4366] is not intensified to a bold opposition to Paul.[4367] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a> sqq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2 Corinthians 5:10</a><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ φωτὸς αὐτῆς</span>.

The constant standing-open of the gates is admissible, for the reason that there is no night, and therefore the bringing-in of glorious gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-26.htm" title="And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.">Revelation 21:26</a>) need not be interrupted.[4371] To <span class="greekheb">οἴσουσι</span>,[4372] an impersonal subject is to be supplied,[4373] and not <span class="greekheb">οί βασιλεῖς</span>.[4374]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πᾶν κοινὸν</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-14.htm" title="But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.">Acts 10:14</a><span class="greekheb">ποιοῦν βδέλυγμα καὶ ψεῦδος</span>. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm" title="And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:">Revelation 17:4</a> sq., <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>. The more definitely the sins of the heathen are mentioned as the reason for their exclusion from the holy city, the more significant it is to reckon the heathen nations and kings of the earth designated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm" title="And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it.">Revelation 21:24</a> sqq., among those who are written in the book of life. For they also enter into the city, bringing gifts, and that, too, as citizens who are to remain therein. Thus the innate universalism of the genuine ancient-prophetic Apocalyptics which lies at the foundation also of passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a>, is expressed the more pregnantly, because the heathen, received into the new Jerusalem, are designated in the same words (<span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔθνη</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς</span>) as were employed by ch. 13 in the expression standing for the heathen world worshipping the beast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4359] <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm" title="Therefore your gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.">Isaiah 60:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm" title="The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.">Psalm 72:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4360] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4361] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3</a> sqq. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a> sq.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-9.htm" title="And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall mourn her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,">Revelation 18:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-15.htm" title="The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,">Revelation 18:15</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-17.htm" title="For in one hour so great riches is come to nothing.

He also and others, who first revised the New Testament in Greek, if they should compare the copious materials collected in these two centuries, with that scantiness with which they themselves formerly had to contend, would willingly yield to the truth, and would exhort the most eager defenders of the reading established by them, in some instances with such difficulty, either to follow or lead them to better things.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ</span></span></span>) answers to the prefix <span class="greekheb">ל</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a>.

The description, following that of Isaiah, makes use of earthly symbolism; but it is not, therefore, to be supposed (as Afford) that there will be hereafter a real earth with inhabitants. "The nations" are the redeemed, described in this way on account of their selection from every "kindred, and nation, and tribe, and tongue" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>): not the wicked nations of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>. Though the Authorized Version is probably incorrect in inserting "of them which are saved," yet these words appear to give the correct sense of the passage. The description is evidently still founded on the prophetical writings, "And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</span> Omit "and honour," according to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, P, and others. Not that there are literal kings and earth. The language is intended to convey an idea of God's supreme glory and unquestioned authority. There are now no kings to dispute his sway. Instead, all join in promoting his glory. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of them which are saved<p>Omit.<p>In the light (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>Read &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; "amidst the light" or "by the light."<p>Do bring (&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>The present tense, denoting habit.<p>Glory and honor<p>Omit and honor.
