Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having the glory of God - A glory or splendor such as became the dwelling place of God. The nature of that splendor is described in the following verses.<p>And her light - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a> it is said that "the glory of God did lighten it." That is, it was made light by the visible symbol of the Deity - the "Shekinah." See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3</a> note. The word here rendered "light" - &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1;  pho&#772;ste&#772;r - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>. It means, properly, a light, a lightgiver, and, in profane writers, means commonly a "window." It is used here to denote the brightness or shining of the divine glory, as supplying the place of the sun, or of a window.<p>Like unto a stone most precious - A stone of the richest or most costly nature.<p>Even like a jasper stone - On the jasper, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>. It is used there for the same purpose as here, to illustrate the majesty and glory of God.<p>Clear as crystal - Pellucid or resplendent like crystal. There are various kinds of jasper - as red, yellow, and brown, brownish yellow, etc. The stone is essentially a quartz, and the word "crystal" here is used to show that the form of it referred to by John was clear and bright. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Not only upon their souls, which will lie in the glorious robe of Christ's righteousness, the bride's wedding garment being on them, in the perfect holiness which will be in them, and in that complete knowledge of all spiritual and heavenly things they will be possessed of, they will have a glory revealed in them; but upon their bodies also, for this city, the church, the bride of Christ, will consist only of risen and changed saints, whose bodies will be freed from all dishonour; deformity, diseases, and imperfections, and will be made like unto Christ's glorious body, and will shine like the sun in the kingdom of God. Moreover, the presence of God may be intended by his glory, as the Shechinah, or the divine majesty of God in the tabernacle and temple was called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a> for the glorious presence of God will now be in this church state, which will cast a lustre on all that are in it; for if the face of Moses, and of Stephen, shone so bright and glorious, through the presence of God with them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a> how much more gloriously will the saints shine in this state, when they shall enjoy the presence of God in a far more illustrious manner? to which may be added, that Jesus Christ, who is the brightness of his Father's glory, will now appear in that, and in his own, and in the glory of his angels; and all the saints will appear with him in glory; and to see them in all this glory is a glorious sight indeed! <p>And her light was like unto a stone most precious; by her "light" is not meant the light she will have in her, though that will be exceeding great, but the fountain of it from whence it comes; that which holds it forth to her, and supplies her with it: the word signifies an illuminator, and is used of the ministers of the Gospel, that hold forth the word of life and light to others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a> but here it intends Christ, who is the sun of righteousness, the church's light or enlightener, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a> not with the light of nature, as he enlightens every man, nor with the light of grace, with which the saints are enlightened by him in the present state of things, by his Spirit, through the word and ordinances, but with the light of glory: and he is comparable to the most precious stone; he is more precious than rubies; he is so now to them that believe, in his person, offices, grace, and righteousness, and will be more so in his light and glory in the new Jerusalem state: <p>even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal: God the Father, who sits on the throne, is said to be to look upon like a "jasper";  See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>; and here Christ, the illuminator of his church, is said to be like one, because of the exceeding brightness of this stone, and the durableness of it, expressive of the perpetuity of Christ, as the light of his church and people; he is the everlasting light of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a> and he is compared to the crystallising "jasper". There is one sort which is called "Aerizusa", like to air (c), and another "Crystallizusa" (d), clear as crystal. So Pliny speaks (e) of a white "jasper" called "Astrios", and which, he says, is crystallo propinquans, "near to crystal", found in India, and on the shores of Pallene. To this Christ is like, because he is light itself, and in him is no darkness at all, and will cause an everlasting day; and such a clear and bright state of things, as that there will be no night, nor any more darkness, nothing but everlasting joy, peace, prosperity, and happiness; there seems to be some reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>. <p>(c) Ruaeus de Gemmis, l. 2. c. 1.((d) Dioscorides, l. 5. c. 160.
