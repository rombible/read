The recurrence of the number hundred and forty-four recalls us to the figurative character of the description. (Comp.

Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he measured the wall thereof - In respect to its "height." Of course, its length corresponded with the extent of the city.<p>An hundred and forty and four cubits - This would be, reckoning the cubit at eighteen inches, two hundred and sixteen feet. This is less than the height of the walls of Babylon, which Herodotus says were three hundred and fifty feet high. See the introduction to chapter 13 of Isaiah. As the walls of a city are designed to protect it from external foes, the height mentioned here gives all proper ideas of security; and we are to conceive of the city itself as towering immensely above the walls. Its glory, therefore, would not be obscured by the wall that was thrown around it for defense.<p>According to the measure of a man - The measure usually employed by men. This seems to be added in order to prevent any mistake as to the size of the city. It is an "angel" who makes the measurement, and without this explanation it might perhaps be supposed that he used some measure not in common use among people, so that, after all, it would be impossible to form any definite idea of the size of the city.<p>That is, of the angel - That is, "which is the measure employed by the angel."

The walls of the historical Babylon are differently stated as having been 200, 300, or nearly 340 feet high. But we are told that they were about 80 feet in breadth (Hdt. I. 178:5: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-58.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labor in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.">Jeremiah 51:58</a>): so if we do admit that the City here is conceived as 340 miles high, there is a sort of proportion in making its walls not less than 73 yards thick.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to … the angel</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">of an angel</span>. Angels use, he means, a cubit of the same length as men—viz. the average length of the forearm, from the elbow to the finger-tip. It is perhaps implied, that angels are not of superhuman stature.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/revelation/21.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-17.htm" title="And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.">Revelation 21:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ ἐμέτρησε τὸ τεῖχος αὐτῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἑκατὸν τεσσαράκοντα τεσσάρων μέτρον ἀνθρώπου ὅ ἐστιν ἀγγέλου</span>) After <span class="greekheb">ἑκατὸν τεσσαράκοντα τεσσάρων</span> many have added <span class="greekheb">πηχῶν</span>:[233] but we have shown in the Apparatus, see Ed. ii. on this passage, that more than one ancient witness is without this word. It is certain that they are not <span class="ital">walls</span>, but the measures of one <span class="ital">wall</span>, which are noticed: and even <span class="ital">reeds</span> might be understood. The 12,000 stadia show the height also of the city; the 144 either reeds or cubits give the height of the wall, which is not much less than the height of the city, or rather equal to it. For height is especially regarded in walls, as the epithets even of the Greek and Latin poets prove. The 12,000 stadia, since they are mentioned absolutely, were those in use among men: the 144 either cubits or reeds were not those of men, but angelico-human, much greater than those of men. Whether there were 144 reeds or cubits, the comparison of the 12,000 stadia exhibits the same height of wall. But yet there is a strong argument which advises us rather to take them as reeds. For it is not shown how many cubits a reed contains: and it might contain four cubits, because four cubits <span class="ital">measure</span> the stature of a man; or six cubits, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm" title="And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.">Ezekiel 40:5</a>. Therefore, if the wall was of 144 cubits, it would not be known of how many reeds also it was: and therefore <span class="ital">the golden reed</span>, which is called <span class="ital">the measure</span>, would be an unknown, that is, no measure in reality. The height of the wall was ascertained, the angel applying his reed 144 times. <span class="ital">The measure of the reed</span> is frequently noticed in Ezekiel in a similar argument, and by ellipsis; and in one instance, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-17.htm" title="He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.">Ezekiel 42:17</a>, just as here in the Apocalypse. The Greeks have inserted <span class="greekheb">πήχεις</span>. See Meyer de Ultimis Ezech. p. 26, etc. The Hebrews often construe the numeral adjective and the substantive in the plural and singular number; for instance, <span class="greekheb">וארבעת אלפים מדה</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-30.htm" title="And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.">Ezekiel 48:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-33.htm" title="And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.">Ezekiel 48:33</a>.

John <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΘΡΩΠΟΕΙΔῶς ἘΘΕΏΡΗΣΕ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">saw in human appearance</span>, as Andreas of Cæsarea says, the angel measurer: therefore “that measuring pole,” says Grotius, “was of the same size as the stature of the human form, in which the angel appeared, and therefore the cubits also were according to that measure.” Grotius might have spared the clause respecting <span class="ital">the cubits</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[233] So AB Vulg.

The parallel between the shape of the city as just related and the holy of holies (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) almost seems to have insensibly suggested the transition from <span class="accented">stadia</span> to <span class="accented">cubits.</span> The discrepancy between the height of the city, which is twelve thousand furlongs (ver. 16), and the height of the <span class="accented">wall</span>, which is a hundred and forty-four cubits, has led to the suggestion that in the height of the city is included the hill on which it stands (Alford). Others understand that the wall is purposely described as of small height, because the writer wishes to indicate that "the most inconsiderable wall is sufficient to exclude all that is impure" (Dusterdieck). <span class="cmt_word">According to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel;</span> <span class="accented">of an angel.</span> That is, the measure here used by the angel is that used by men (cf.

Hence a cubit or ell, a measure of the distance from the joint of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, i.e., about a foot and a half. The precise length, however, is disputed. Cubit is from the Latin cubitus the elbow, on which one reclines (cubat). Some take the one hundred and forty-four cubits as representing the height of the wall; others the thickness. If the height, then they must be interpreted as equal to the twelve thousand furlongs, since the length and the breadth and the height of the city are equal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>). It is to be noted, however, that there is a distinction between the measure of the city and the measure of the wall. "The most inconsiderable wall" remarks Dsterdieck, "is sufficient to exclude all that is impure."<p>The measure of a man, that is, of the angel<p>"It is to be the dwelling-place of men; and even, therefore, when an angel measures it, he measures it according to the measure of a man" (Milligan). </body></html>
