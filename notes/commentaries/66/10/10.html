Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.">Ezekiel 3:3</a>). So the Psalmist could rejoice in God’s words and God’s law as sweet, sweeter than honey and the honeycomb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-103.htm" title="How sweet are your words to my taste! yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!">Psalm 119:103</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm" title="More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.">Psalm 19:10</a>). He who is ready to endure bitterness in his fidelity to God must not only be interpenetrated by divine teaching; he must have also realised its sweetness, or else, however pleasant his words may sound, they will lack the sweetness which is as needful to the words of the teacher as to the songs of the poet. But the after effect of the sweet-tasting roll is bitterness. Ezekiel makes no mention of this bitterness; yet we know how much his fidelity to the words he loved so well must have cost him when he was bidden to arm himself with a flinty determination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/3-9.htm" title="As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 3:9-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6-7</a>), and the patient courage of one whose lot was among thorns and briars and scorpions. It must always be so. The love of Christ may constrain men, but the very ardour of their affections must bring them through tribulation, and may make them as outcasts, defamed, persecuted, slain. The flaming zeal to emancipate mankind from thraldoms, follies, and ruinous sins may stir the soul with a holy joy; but there come moments when men are almost tempted to turn back, and to think that they have undertaken a hopeless task, when they find how slow is their progress, and what new and unexpected difficulties arise. Such was the bitterness which Moses felt: “Why is it that Thou hast sent me? For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast Thou delivered thy people at all.” The most enthusiastic souls who love their fellow-men, and who feel how sweet and high is their calling, perhaps feel most of this bitterness. Their very love makes all failure very bitter to bear; yet is it through this martyrdom of failure that the noblest victories are won.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:8-11 Most men feel pleasure in looking into future events, and all good men like to receive a word from God. But when this book of prophecy was thoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents would be bitter; there were things so awful and terrible, such grievous persecutions of the people of God, such desolations in the earth, that the foresight and foreknowledge of them would be painful to his mind. Let us seek to be taught by Christ, and to obey his orders; daily meditating on his word, that it may nourish our souls; and then declaring it according to our several stations. The sweetness of such contemplations will often be mingled with bitterness, while we compare the Scriptures with the state of the world and the church, or even with that of our own hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter - The effect immediately followed: that is, as soon as he was made acquainted with the contents of the book, either, as above explained, requiring him to deliver some message of woe and wrath which it would be painful to deliver, or that the consequence of receiving it was to bring on bitter persecutions and trials. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. the little book&#8212;So A and C, but B, Aleph, and Vulgate, "the book."<p>was bitter&#8212;Greek, "was embittered."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And I took the little book, and ate it up; </span> according to the command, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-9.htm" title="And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little book.
