And I went away to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take and eat it up; and it shall make bitter thy belly, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey</span>. The image of eating the roll is derived from the Old Testament. We meet with it in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16</a>). The passage in Ezekiel is probably the basis of the present passage, and the chapter in which it occurs gives us the meaning of the symbol: the eating of the roll, or the words of the roll, is the complete mastering of the contents of the book—the digesting, as we say, its meaning, till the principles and truths are thoroughly familiar and loved. “All my words” (so runs the explanatory verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-10.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.">Ezekiel 3:10</a>) “that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears.” It is similar to the Psalmist’s practice: “Thy words have I hid within my heart;” he made himself so familiar with them that they were no longer a code of laws, but a constant instinct, a second nature to him. Thus preeminently should he be familiar with his Master’s words and heart, saturated with his Master’s principles, who is to be a witness and a prophet for his Lord. “He who would carry God’s words to another must first be impressed and penetrated with them himself. He must not only hear, read, mark, and learn, but also (according to the Scriptural figure) inwardly digest them.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/10-8.htm" title="And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands on the sea and on the earth....">Revelation 10:8-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the voice said, Go </span>up to the angel standing upon the sea and the earth, <span class="ital">and take the little book which is open </span>— To signify that its contents were not to be kept secret like those of the seven thunders, but revealed for the instruction, direction, encouragement, or warning of mankind, as well as those of the larger book; for it was a kind of second prophecy added to the former, and as it concerned <span class="ital">kings </span>and <span class="ital">nations, </span>so it was to be made public for their use and information. <span class="ital">And I went unto the angel </span>— As I was directed; <span class="ital">and said </span>— With boldness, in consequence of the divine command; <span class="ital">Give me the little book.

As this prophecy was to reveal the providences of God during the period of the seventh trumpet, in which, as there was a revelation of great opposition to true religion, and persecution of the faithful professors of it, so was there also a revelation of divine protection during the time of trial, and of a sure accomplishment of the promises concerning the glorious and happy state of the church in the end. The consideration of such a dispensation of Providence might well occasion a mixture of joy and grief in the apostle’s mind, as it must do in the minds of all who understand and reflect upon it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:8-11 Most men feel pleasure in looking into future events, and all good men like to receive a word from God. But when this book of prophecy was thoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents would be bitter; there were things so awful and terrible, such grievous persecutions of the people of God, such desolations in the earth, that the foresight and foreknowledge of them would be painful to his mind. Let us seek to be taught by Christ, and to obey his orders; daily meditating on his word, that it may nourish our souls; and then declaring it according to our several stations. The sweetness of such contemplations will often be mingled with bitterness, while we compare the Scriptures with the state of the world and the church, or even with that of our own hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the voice which I heard from heaven - <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4</a>. This is not the voice of the angel, but a direct divine command,<p>Said, Go and take the little book which is open, ... - That is, take it out of his hand, and do with it as you shall be commanded. There is a very strong resemblance between this passage and the account contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>. Ezekiel was directed to go to the house of Israel and deliver a divine message, whether they would hear or forbear; and in order that he might understand what message to deliver, there was shown to him a roll of a book, written within and without. That roll he was commanded to eat, and he found it to be "in his mouth as honey for sweetness." John has added to this the circumstance that, though "sweet in the mouth," it made "the belly bitter." The additional command <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/10-11.htm">Revelation 10:11</a>, that he must yet "prophecy before many people," leads us to suppose that he had the narrative in Ezekiel in his eye; for, as the result of his eating the roll, he was commanded to go and prophesy to the people of Israel. The passage here <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-8.htm">Revelation 10:8</a> introduces a new symbol, that of "eating the book," and evidently refers to something that was to occur before the "mystery should be finished"; that is, before the seventh trumpet should sound.<p>"Which is open in the hand ..."

How John, who continues to have his standpoint in heaven (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm" title="And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:">Revelation 10:1</a>), could go to the angel who stands on the earth and sea, is not made perceptible to sober view, because in the vision the question is only concerning the act of going. But even if one, like De Wette, consider that John, even prior to ch. 10, “had occupied the standpoint of Zechariah, Ezekiel, and Daniel,” the difficulty of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠῆΛΘΑ</span></span></span> remains essentially the same; hence De Wette has properly reached <span class="ital">no</span> conclusion from this expression concerning the standpoint of John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δοῦναι</span>. Concerning this inf.,[2754] dependent on the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΈΓΩΝ</span></span></span>, cf. Winer, p. 296.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΆΦΑΓΕ ΑὐΤΌ</span></span></span>. The eating of the book[2755] is within the entire visionary scene not to be regarded an expression intended allegorically, but as a real act of John; just as Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-9.htm" title="I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.">Revelation 2:9</a> sqq.) by eating a book receives the contents of its prophetic discourses. The meaning of the visionary fact is correctly given already by Beda: “Take into your inward parts, and contain within the space of thy heart.” What <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16</a> in figurative language calls an eating of the words of divine revelation, which must be converted by the prophet into marrow and blood,[2756] we find here, as in Ezekiel, represented in an actual visionary transaction.[2757]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ πικρανεῖ</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μέλι</span>. From the fact that the angel speaks first of the bitter effect and then of the sweet taste of the little book, but John himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-10.htm" title="And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.">Revelation 10:10</a>) the reverse, it does not follow that “both vigorously struggled for priority.”[2758] According to the context, the “priority” belongs—not only as to order, but also as to minor dignity—to the sweetness, because the book comes first into the mouth and last into the belly. According to this most simple order, John himself reports, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-10.htm" title="And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.">Revelation 10:10</a>. The angel looks at it differently, since he speaks,—as the combination of the two expressions into one antithesis shows,—not according to the mere consequences, but with respect to the inner nature and effect. The angel intends first to prepare John for the bitter effect, but then he also says that the book will be in his mouth sweet as honey. This is also against Beng., who, by a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/10-9.htm" title="And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make your belly bitter, but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey....">Revelation 10:9-10</a>, immediately infers two kinds of sweetness, one before and one after the bitterness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The relation of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΙΚΡΑΝΕῖ ΣΟΥ ΤῊΝ ΚΟΙΛΊΑΝ</span></span></span> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΚΡΆΝΘΗ Ἡ ΚΟΙΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Μ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-10.htm" title="And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.">Revelation 10:10</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-11.htm" title="And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.">Revelation 8:11</a>) and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΛΥΚῪ Ὡς ΜΈΛΙ</span></span></span> is, in accordance with the context, to be determined according to both norms: that one and the same book is sweet and bitter according as it enters the mouth or the belly; then, that the distinction between the mouth and the belly is understood only with reference to the eating. Incorrect, therefore, are both the explanation which refers the sweetness and bitterness to the difference between the joyful and the sad contents of the book,[2759]—in connection with which a further error is readily intruded, that, with a result contrary to the context, speaks of “bitter-sweet” contents, indicating that only after a sad visitation could glorious joy enter;[2760] and also that which—in connection with a false interpretation of the little book itself, of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ ΠΡΟΦΗΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.">Revelation 10:11</a>, yea even of the angel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm" title="And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:">Revelation 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-8.htm" title="And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands on the sea and on the earth.">Revelation 10:8</a>—regards the mouth of John not as the organ of eating (receiving), but of speaking, and then refers the bitterness to the persecutions and all the hinderances with which the evangelical preaching of John or the entire Church met.[2761] With correctness, Vitr., C. a Lap., De Wette, Stern, Hengstenb., etc., have interpreted, that, as the mouth refers to the receiving of the revelation given in the little book, so the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΙΛΊΑ</span></span></span>—not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΡΔΊΑ</span></span></span>, as Cod. A reads, and Andr. explains, disturbing the clearness of the idea of the text by mingling therewith a rash interpretation—is directed to the comprehension, i.e., the further scrutiny[2762] and perception, of the revelation received. [See Note LXVI., p. 309.] How little the sweetness of the reception, as such, was hindered by the bitterness of the contents of revelation, is shown by the symbol of Ezekiel, in whose mouth the book written with mourning and woe is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ΜΈΛΙ ΓΛΥΚΆΖΟΝ</span></span></span>.[2763] But he also went <span class="ital">bitterly</span>, after he had filled his belly therewith,[2764] in the heat of his spirit.[2765]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By eating the book, John is made able to proclaim its contents. Therefore <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.">Revelation 10:11</a> follows: <span class="greekheb">καὶ λἐγουσῖν μοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The plur.[2766] makes the speaking subject entirely indefinite; the modified var. points to the angel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δεῖ σε πάλιν προφ</span>. The <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> designates not the inner, subjective necessity, that John now cannot help prophesying, because by eating the book he has been capacitated for prophesying,[2767] but the objective necessity depending upon the will of God, who accordingly gives his revelation.[2768] The <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> does not contrast John’s prophecy with that of the ancient prophets,[2769] but designates a second <span class="greekheb">προφητεῦσαι</span> of John himself, yet not a preaching after a return from exile,[2770] but the new prophecy for which the eaten book has fitted him in its relation to the prophesying practised upon the ground of previous visions. This <span class="greekheb">πάλιν προφητεῦσαι</span> occurs therefore in the succeeding part of the Apoc.[2771]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ λαοῖς</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πολλοῖς</span>. Incorrectly, Beng: “To nations—beyond,” in the sense that there are still many nations, etc., which are, meantime, to come before that is fulfilled which is here described prior to the transition to the second woe. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπί</span> has this meaning neither in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-17.htm" title="For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives.">Hebrews 9:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>, nor elsewhere. Likewise incorrectly, Ebrard: “Before nations,” i.e., so that “the nations have it declared to them.” The <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span> with the dat. designates, precisely as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-16.htm" title="These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.">John 12:16</a>, the object which the prophecy grasps, i.e., concerning which the prophecy is made. The grammatical relation is precisely the same as in the construction of <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> with the dative accompanying verbs designating joy, astonishment, etc., <span class="ital">concerning</span> any thing.[2772] The occasion for the false construction of the <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span> lies, in Ebrard, in the view of the contents of the book, and the range of the prophecy conditioned thereby. If the <span class="greekheb">πάλιν προφητεῦσαι</span> is completed with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm" title="And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.">Revelation 11:13</a>, and is intended for the Church, it cannot be said here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.">Revelation 10:11</a>, that John is to prophesy <span class="ital">concerning</span> nations and kings; and if Hengstenb., who likewise[2773] finds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein....">Revelation 11:1-13</a> the prophecy announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.">Revelation 10:11</a>, and refers it to the degenerate churches, yet explains correctly the <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ λαοῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and compares therewith what is said of kings, chs. 16, 17, 19, this is inconsistent with his view of the little book and the <span class="greekheb">πάλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προφ</span>., just to the extent that it is correct according to the context. Ewald—who agrees formally with Hengstenb. and Ebrard, since he also finds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein....">Revelation 11:1-13</a> the contents of the eaten book, but interprets this new prophecy as referring to the destruction of Jerusalem—refers the <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ λαοῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm" title="But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given to the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.">Revelation 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-9.htm" title="And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.">Revelation 11:9</a>; but since the prophecy <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein....">Revelation 11:1-13</a> is actually one concerning Jerusalem, it cannot well be called at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.">Revelation 10:11</a> a prophecy concerning peoples, nations, languages, and many kings.[2774] Besides, Ew. has understood the significant position of the angel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-2.htm" title="And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth,">Revelation 10:2</a>, with relation to Rome as capital of the world. The result, therefore, is not that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠῚ</span></span></span> is explained ungrammatically, but that we must seek the correct reference of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ ΠΡΟΦΗΤΕῦΣΑΙ</span></span></span>, which must concur with the correct view of the contents of the little book eaten. Upon this depends the ultimate determination of the view of the entire transaction in ch. 10.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2752] See Critical Notes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2753] Cf. the <span class="greekheb">ἦλθε</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-7.htm" title="And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.">Revelation 5:7</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/revelation/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-8.htm" title="And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands on the sea and on the earth.">Revelation 10:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ φωνὴ</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-4.htm" title="And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.">Revelation 10:4</a>) left ungrammatically without a predicate, the two participles being irregularly attracted into the case of <span class="greekheb">ἥν</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">spake unto me again</span>] The true reading is scarcely grammatical, but must mean “[I heard] again speaking unto me.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said</span>; and <span class="accented">the voice which I heard out of heaven</span>, [I heard] <span class="accented">again talking with me and saying.</span> The construction is irregular."
