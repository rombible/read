And it is much illustrated by the view presented to Ezekiel, <span class="ital">when he sat in his house among the elders of the people, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>,) who probably saw nothing but the prophet himself, as one who was in a trance or ecstasy, or whose thoughts were so attentively fixed as to be insensible of what passed around him. We are not therefore to imagine that the person <span class="ital">sitting on the throne, </span>or the <span class="ital">four animals, </span>or <span class="ital">the four and twenty elders, </span>were real beings existing in nature, though they represented, in a figurative manner, things that did really exist. And, though it is possible that aerial scenes might, by divine or angelic power, have been formed, I think it much more probable that all that passed was purely in the imagination of St. John. This will keep us, in our interpretation, clear of a thousand difficulties, not to say absurdities, which would follow from a contrary supposition, namely, that there is in heaven an animal in the form of a lamb, to represent Christ, and that there are such living creatures as here described; and that God himself appears in a human form,” &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Behold, a throne was set in heaven </span>— Representing that of the blessed God; <span class="ital">and one sat on the throne — </span>Of a majestic form and appearance, and arrayed in robes of glory as a king, governor, and judge.

The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And immediately I was in the Spirit - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>. He does not affirm that he was caught up into heaven, nor does he say what impression was on his own mind, if any, as to the place where he was; but he was at once absorbed in the contemplation of the visions before him. He was doubtless still in Patmos, and these things were made to pass before his mind as a reality; that is, they appeared as real to him as if he saw them, and they were in fact a real symbolical representation of things occurring in heaven.<p>And, behold, a throne was set in heaven - That is, a throne was placed there. The first thing that arrested his attention was a throne. Tiffs was "in heaven" - an expression which proves that the scene of the vision was not the temple in Jerusalem, as some have supposed. There is no allusion to the temple, and no imagery drawn from the temple. Isaiah had his vision <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a> in the holy of holies of the temple; Ezekiel E<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>, by the river Chebar; but John looked directly into heaven, and saw the throne of God, and the encircling worshippers there.<p>And one sat on the throne - It is remarkable that John gives no description of him who sat on the throne, nor does he indicate who he was by name. Neither do Isaiah or Ezekiel attempt to describe the appearance of the Deity, nor are there any intimations of that appearance given from which a picture or an image could be formed. So much do their representations accord with what is demanded by correct taste; and so sedulously have they guarded against any encouragement of idolatry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

So also in Re 5:7, as in Da 7:13, the Son of man brought before the Ancient of days is distinguished from Him. The Father in essence is invisible, but in Scripture at times is represented as assuming a visible form.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the Spirit; </span> in an ecstasy, as Paul, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a></span>, and Peter, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10</a></span>, and Ezekiel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-12.htm" title="Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.">Ezekiel 3:12</a></span>, and himself was both before and after this, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a> 17:3 21:10</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne:</span> God is constantly described, in the prophetical visions, as sitting upon a throne, to denote his power and dominion, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords.

As he had been before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>; it seems he had been some little time out of his ecstasy, how long cannot be said, and now, upon this new scene of things, returned to it; upon the opening of the door in heaven, and hearing the former voice, and the things it said, the Spirit of God at once possessed and filled him, in an extraordinary manner; and his soul or spirit was immediately taken from the consideration of all sensible objects, and was fixed and intent upon the things presented to it in the vision, so that it was as if it was out of the body. The Arabic version reads, "then therefore I went in the Spirit"; in obedience to the voice that called him up, in which he was assisted by the Spirit of God, who lifted him up as he did Ezekiel, when he saw what follows: <p>and behold, a throne was set in heaven; not for the final judgment, on which the son of man will sit, when he comes to judge the quick and dead, for he is not the person that fills this but this is a symbol of the power, authority, and dominion now exercised by God, not over the world in general, who has prepared his throne in the heavens, and governs among the nations, according to his sovereign will and pleasure, but which he exercises in his church, signified by "heaven". The allusion is to the temple, and the throne of God in it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>. The temple was an emblem of the Gospel church, Jerusalem, or the Gospel church state, and was to be called the throne of the Lord, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>, and now his throne is set there. Here he exercises a jurisdiction and government; he is King and lawgiver in it; he has enacted laws, and he writes them on the hearts of his people, and puts his Spirit within them, and makes them both able and willing to obey them. <p>And one sat on the throne; not the trinity of persons in the Godhead, which some think are signified by the three precious stones in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>, the jasper, sardine, and emerald; for, as distinct from him that sat upon the throne, the Lamb is said to be in the midst of it, and the seven spirits of God are said to be before it: nor is Jesus Christ intended, and his two natures; his divine nature by the jasper, and his human nature by the red and blood coloured sardine; since he, the Lamb, is represented as in the midst of the throne, and is often distinguished from him that sat upon it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>; but God the Father is designed, who sits on the throne, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, yet in distinction from them.

Hence De Wette and Ebrard properly compare with this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-5.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak; Thus said the LORD; Thus have you said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.">Ezekiel 11:5</a>.

To this entire description, there is a parallel in the <span class="ital">Pirke</span>, R. Elieser,[1670] which is very instructive, because it shows how differently, with many similar features, the O. T. types[1671] appear in a N. T. prophet, and the rabbins:[1672] “Four bands of ministering angels praise God. The first is of Michael, on the right; the second, of Gabriel, on the left; the third, of Uriel, before him; the fourth, of Raphael, behind him. But the shekinah of God is in the centre, and he himself is seated on a lofty, elevated throne; and his seat is high, suspended in the air. The splendor of his magnificence is like Chasmal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>). Upon his head is placed a crown, and upon his brow a diadem with Schemhamphorasch. His eyes go through the whole earth; a part of them is fire, but a part hail. On his right is life; on his left, death; and a fiery sceptre is in his hand. Before him is stretched out a veil (<span class="greekheb">פרכת</span>), and seven angels who were created from the beginning minister before him within the veil. But that which is called <span class="greekheb">פרגוד</span>, and the footstool of his feet, are like fire and lightning, and shine beneath the throne of his glory like sapphire and fire. About his throne are righteousness and judgment. The place of his throne is that of the seven clouds surrounding him with glory; and the wheel of his chariot, and the cherub, and the living ones give to him glory. His throne is like sapphire, and at his feet are four living ones, each of whom has four faces, and as many wings. When God speaks from the east, this is done between the two cherubim with the face of a man; when from the south, then between the two cherubim with the face of a lion; when from the west, then between the two cherubim with the face of an ox; when from the north, then between the two cherubim with the face of an eagle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The living ones also stand beside the throne of glory, yet they know not the place of his glory. The living ones stand also in fear and trembling, in horror and agitation, and from this agitation of their faces, a river of fire flows forth before them. Of the two seraphim, one stands at God’s right hand, another at his left. Each has six wings; with two they cover their face, lest they may see the face of the shekinah; with two they cover their feet, lest the feet may see the shekinah, and immediately be able to find his footstep; but with two they fly, dread and sanctify his great name. One cries out, and another replies, saying, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the living ones stand beside his glory, yet they know not the place of his glory, but in every place where his glory is, they cry and say, Blessed be the glory of God in its place.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">θρόνος-g0- ἔκειτο-g0-</span>. The expression <span class="greekheb">κεῖσθαι</span> indicates neither an especial <span class="ital">breadth</span> of the throne,[1673] nor that it rests upon the cherubim,[1674] because the word here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm" title="The LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 24:1</a>, LXX.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-6.htm" title="And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.">John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm" title="Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.">John 19:29</a>, and in the classics,[1675] expresses the simple idea of “being placed.”[1676]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΠῚ ΤῸΝ ΘΡΌΝΟΝ ΚΑΘΉΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>.

And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 1:12</a> sqq., also, he has not expressly mentioned the manifestation of Christ. Utterly preposterous is the declaration of Heinr.: “The name seems to have been omitted only by carelessness in writing, which is especially conspicuous in this entire chapter.” Just as impertinent is the allusion to the Jewish dread of uttering the name of God.[1679] Suitable in itself to John would be the explanation of Herder: “To name him, the soul has no image, language no word;”[1680] but even this is not here applicable, as John in general, even where he definitely mentions the vision here described, expressly calls God the enthroned one.[1681] These passages show at the same time that the enthroned one is regarded[1682] not as the Triune God,[1683] but as God the Father, in distinction from the Son,[1684] and the Spirit.[1685] So Alcas., Stern, Grot., Wetst., Vitr., Beng., Hengstenb., etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1668] C. a Lap., Beng., etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1669] Cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.">Revelation 4:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1670] 100:4 in Schöttgen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1671] Isaiah 6; Ezekiel 1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a> sqq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-29.htm" title="So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.">1 Kings 22:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1672] Cf. also R.

The royal presence is depicted in this theophany by means of similes and metaphors (partly rabbinic) which originally were suggested in part by the marvellous atmospheric colouring of an Eastern sky during storm or sunset; several had been for long traditional and fanciful modes of expressing the divine transcendence (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, En. xiv. 18 f. the divine glory like crystal, etc.) which dominates the Apocalypse. God is a silent, enthroned (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a> etc.), eternal Figure, hidden by the very excess of light, keeping ward and watch over his people, but never directly interfering in their affairs till the judgment, when mankind appears before his throne for doom and recompense. This reluctance to name or describe God, so characteristic of the later Judaism, was allied to the feeling which mediated his action upon the world through angels or through his Christ (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-8.htm" title="And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.">Revelation 15:8</a>). For the tendency to describe God and heaven in priestly terms, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Gfrörer, i. 276 f. The whole of the present passage is illustrated by <span class="ital">Pirke Elieser</span>, iv.: “majestas sancti benedicti est in medio quattuor classium angelicarum.

Apparently God revealed Himself by such symbols to men whom He had educated to such a point that they should not imagine them to be <span class="ital">more</span> than symbols. Therefore perhaps to attempt to include representations of the Father in the range of Christian art is rather of dangerous boldness than <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> illegitimate: see on this question Ruskin’s <span class="ital">Modern Painters</span>, Part III.

Those things which the Apocalypse everywhere touches upon of heavenly subjects, viz. the temple, the throne, the assembly, the altar, the ark of the covenant, may not inappropriately be illustrated from the writings of the ancient Hebrews.

Omit "and" (see above), so that the passage may be rendered, <span class="accented">After these things, immediately, I was in the Spirit</span>; a new scene was opened out, as before (in ver. 1). St. John was already <span class="accented">in the Spirit</span>; but now receives a fresh outpouring of grace, enabling him to see yet more deeply into the mysteries of the kingdom of God. And, behold, a throne was set in heaven; or, <span class="accented">a throne was situated</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). There is no action of placing or setting up. Compare the vision of Ezekiel, "In the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>), where the throne appears above the cherubim, in the position of the cloud of glory (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1, 2</a>, where the seraphim are above). <span class="cmt_word">And one sat on the throne.</span> Probably the Triune God, to whom the Trisagien in ver. 8 is addressed. Some have thought that the Father is indicated, in contradistinction to the other Persons of the Holy Trinity, and that it is from him that the Son takes the book in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>. But as Cornelius a Lapide remarks, "The Son as Man may well be said, especially in a sublime vision like this, to come to God." The Person is not named, because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Name of God is incommunicable; it is the "new Name" (see on Revelation 3:12); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because the seer describes only what is seen; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it is suppressed from a sense of reverence. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I was in the Spirit (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Strictly, I:became: I found myself in.
