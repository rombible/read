The woman apparelled in purple splendour sits upon many waters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>).

The waters represent the unguided, unreasoning, and unprincipled thoughts of men. By analogy, the calm glass-like sea, which is never in storm, but only interfused with flame (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>), represents the counsels of God, those purposes of righteousness and love, often fathomless, but never obscure; always the same, though sometimes glowing with holy anger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a>).

The word <span class="ital">beasts </span>not only degrades the signification, but the animals here mentioned have parts and appearances which beasts have not, and are represented in the highest sense rational.” It has been observed on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>, that the four and twenty elders may represent the Jewish Church. If so, these living creatures may represent the Christian Church. Their number, also, is symbolical of universality, and agrees with the dispensation of the gospel, which extends to all nations under heaven. And the <span class="ital">new song, </span>which they all sing, saying, <span class="ital">Thou hast redeemed us out of every kindred: and tongue, and people, and nation, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>,) could not possibly suit the Jewish without the Christian Church; nor is it, in any respect, applicable to angels. <span class="ital">The first living creature was like a lion </span>— To signify undaunted courage; <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="ital">second like a calf </span>— Or <span class="ital">ox, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a>,) to signify unwearied patience: <span class="ital">the third </span>with <span class="ital">the face of a man </span>— To signify prudence and compassion; <span class="ital">the fourth like a flying eagle </span>— To signify activity and vigour; <span class="ital">full of eyes </span>— To betoken wisdom and knowledge; <span class="ital">before </span>— To see the face of him that sitteth on the throne; <span class="ital">and behind </span>— To see what is done among the creatures. Two things may be observed here; 1st, That the four qualities, thus emblematically set forth in these four living creatures, namely, undaunted courage, unwearied patience under sufferings, prudence, and compassion, and vigorous activity, are found, more or less, in the true members of Christ’s church in every age and nation. 2d, That it may possibly be here intimated, that these qualities would especially prevail in succeeding ages of the church, in the order in which they are here placed; that is, that in the first age, true Christians would be eminent for the courage, fortitude, and success wherewith they should spread the gospel; that in the next age they would manifest remarkable patience in bearing persecution, when they should be <span class="ital">killed all the day, </span>like calves or sheep appointed for the slaughter: that in the subsequent age or ages, when the storms of persecution were blown over, and Christianity generally spread through the whole Roman empire, knowledge and wisdom, piety and virtue should increase, the church should wear the <span class="ital">face of a man; </span>and excel in prudence, humanity, love, and good works: and that in ages still later, being reformed from various corruptions in doctrine and practice, and full of vigour and activity, it should carry the gospel as upon the wings of <span class="ital">a flying eagle, </span>to the remotest nations under heaven; to every kindred, and tongue, and people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And before the throne there was a sea of glass - An expanse spread out like a sea composed of glass: that is, that was pellucid and transparent like glass. It is not uncommon to compare the sea with glass. See numerous examples in Wetstein, in loco. The point of the comparison here seems to be its transparent appearance. It was perfectly clear - apparently stretching out in a wide expanse, as if it were a sea.<p>Like unto crystal - The word "crystal" means properly anything congealed and pellucid, as ice; then anything resembling that, particularly a certain species of stone distinguished for its clearness - as the transparent crystals of quartz; limpid and colorless quartz; rock or mountain quartz. The word "crystal" now, in mineralogy, means an inorganic body which, by the operation of affinity, has assumed the form of a regular solid, by a certain number of plane and smooth faces. It is used here manifestly in its popular sense to denote anything that is perfectly clear like ice. The comparison, in the representation of the expanse spread around the throne, turns on these points:<p>(1) It appeared like a sea - stretching afar.<p>(2) it resembled, in its general appearance, glass; and this idea is strengthened by the addition of another image of the same character - that it was like an expanse of crystal, perfectly clear and pellucid. This would seem to be designed to represent the floor or pavement on which the throne stood. If this is intended to be emblematical, it may denote:<p>(a) that the empire of God is vast - as if it were spread out like the sea; or.<p>(b) it may be emblematic of the calmness, the placidity of the divine administration - like an undisturbed and unruffled ocean of glass. Perhaps, however, we should not press such circumstances too far to find a symbolical meaning.<p>And in the midst of the throne - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  en meso&#772; tou thronou. Not occupying the throne, but so as to appear to be intermingled with the throne, or "in the midst" of it, in the sense that it was beneath the center of it. The meaning would seem to be, that the four living creatures referred to occupied such a position collectively that they at the same time appeared to be under the throne, so that it rested on them, and around it, so that they could be seen from any quarter. This would occur if their bodies were under the throne, and if they stood so that they faced outward. To one approaching the throne they would seem to be around it, though their bodies were under, or "in the midst" of it as a support. The form of their bodies is not specified, but it is not improbable that though their heads were different, their bodies, that were under the throne, and that sustained it, were of the same form.<p>And round about the throne - In the sense above explained - that, as they stood, they would be seen on every side of the throne.<p>Were four beasts - This is a very unhappy translation, as the word "beasts" by no means conveys a correct idea of the original word. The Greek word - &#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  zoo&#772;n - means properly "a living thing"; and it is thus indeed applied to animals, or to the living creation, but the notion of their being living things, or living creatures, should be retained in the translation. Prof. Stuart renders it, "living creatures." Isaiah Isa 6:1-13, in his vision of Yahweh, saw two seraphim; Ezekiel, whom John more nearly resembles in his description, saw four "living creatures" - &#1495;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;  chayowt <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5</a> - that is, living, animated, moving beings. The words "living beings" would better convey the idea than any other which could be employed. They are evidently, like those which Ezekiel saw, symbolical beings; but the nature and purpose of the symbol is not perfectly apparent. The "four and twenty elders" are evidently human beings, and are representatives, as above explained, of the church.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>, angels are themselves introduced as taking an important part in the worship of heaven: and these living beings, therefore, cannot be designed to represent either angels or human beings. In Ezekiel they are either designed as poetic representations of the majesty of God, or of his providential government, showing what sustains his throne; symbols denoting intelligence, vigilance, the rapidity and directness with which the divine commands are executed, and the energy and firmness with which the government of God is administered. The nature of the case, and the similarity to the representation in Ezekiel, would lead us to suppose that the same idea is to be found substantially in John; and there would be no difficulty in such an interpretation were it not that these "living creatures" are apparently represented in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8-9</a>, as uniting with the redeemed from the earth in such a manner as to imply that they were themselves redeemed.<p>But perhaps the language in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, "And they sung a new song," etc., though apparently connected with the "four beasts" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>, is not designed to be so connected. John may intend there merely to advert to the fact that a new song was sung, without meaning to say that the "four living beings" united in that song. For, if he designed merely to say that the "four living beings" and the "four and twenty elders" fell down to worship, and then that a song was heard, though in fact sung only by the four and twenty eiders, he might have employed the language which he actually has done. If this interpretation be admitted, then the most natural explanation to be given of the "four living beings" is to suppose that they are symbolical beings designed to furnish some representation of the government of God - to illustrate, as it were, that on which the divine government rests, or which constitutes its support - to wit, power, intelligence, vigilance, energy. This is apparent:<p>(a) because it was not unusual for the thrones of monarchs to be supported by carved animals of various forms, which were designed undoubtedly to be somehow emblematic of government - either of its stability, vigilance, boldness, or firmness. Thus, Solomon had twelve lions carved on each side of his throne - no improper emblems of government - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-20.htm">1 Kings 10:20</a>.<p>(b) These living beings are described as the supports of the throne of God, or as that on which it rests, and would be, therefore, no improper symbols of the great principles or truths which give support or stability to the divine administration.<p>(c) They are, in themselves, well adapted to be representatives of the great principles of the divine government, or of the divine providential dealings, as we shall see in the more particular explanation of the symbol.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Two oldest manuscripts, A, B, Vulgate, Coptic, and Syriac read, "As it were a sea of glass."<p>like &#8230; crystal&#8212;not imperfectly transparent as the ancient common glass, but like rock crystal. Contrast the turbid "many waters" on which the harlot "sitteth" (Re 17:1, 15). Compare Job 37:18, "the sky &#8230; as a molten looking-glass." Thus, primarily, the pure ether which separates God's throne from John, and from all things before it, may be meant, symbolizing the "purity, calmness, and majesty of God's rule" [Alford]. But see the analogue in the temple, the molten sea before the sanctuary (see on [2688]Re 4:4, above). There is in this sea depth and transparency, but not the fluidity and instability of the natural sea (compare Re 21:1). It stands solid, calm, and clear, God's judgments are called "a great deep" (Ps 36:6). In Re 15:2 it is a "sea of glass mingled with fire." Thus there is symbolized here the purificatory baptism of water and the Spirit of all who are made "kings and priests unto God." In Re 15:2 the baptism with the fire of trial is meant. Through both all the king-priests have to pass in coming to God: His judgments, which overwhelm the ungodly, they stand firmly upon, as on a solid sea of glass; able like Christ to walk on the sea, as though it were solid.<p>round about the throne&#8212;one in the midst of each side of the throne.<p>four beasts&#8212;The Greek for "beasts," Re 13:1, 11, is different, therion, the symbol for the carnal man by opposition to God losing his true glory, as lord, under Him, of the lower creatures, and degraded to the level of the beast. Here it is zoon, "living creatures"; not beast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And before the throne; </span> the throne mentioned before, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-2.htm" title="And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.">Revelation 4:2</a>,3</span>, upon which <span class="ital">one sat, </span>& c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A sea of glass like unto crystal; </span> another allusion to the tabernacle or temple, in which was a sea, that is, a large vessel full of water; it was for Aaron and his sons to wash their hands, and feet, and sacrifices in, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-19.htm" title="For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:">Exodus 30:19</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm" title="And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.">1 Kings 7:23</a></span>; it was ten cubits broad, five cubits high, and thirty cubits about.

Other guesses there are many at the significancy of this <span class="ital">sea of glass, </span> but this seems to me most probable, because the use of the sea in the temple is made good in Christ.

Some judge them the four evangelists; but John himself was one of these, and yet alive. Some will have them four apostles that were mostly at Jerusalem; but I see no ground for that. Some will have them angels; others, glorified saints; but we shall afterwards find them distinguished from both these. Others will have them the whole church. But the most probable sense is, that they represented the ministers of the church, who are living creatures, whose place is between God and his church, as those beasts are placed between the throne and the elders; and who are but four to the twenty-four elders, being but few in comparison with the multitude of believers; and yet have eyes on all sides, being enough to see to the affairs of the whole church of Christ on the earth. In this sense I rest; only here remains a question, how these are said to be <span class="ital">in the midst of the throne, </span> and yet <span class="ital">round about the throne?</span> To which various answers are given; that which pleaseth me best is, en mesw, in the middle, is not to be strained to signify a place at equal distance from two extremes, but more largely and proverbially for near the throne, or near him who sat upon the throne. See the several notions about this phrase in Mr. Pool’s Latin Synopsis. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal,.... By which is meant, not heaven, nor the souls of the blessed there, nor the multitude of the holy angels, nor the first converts to Christianity at Jerusalem; for those that got the victory over the beast are said to stand upon this sea, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>, which these senses, especially the three last, will by no means admit of. Some by it understand the world, which may be compared to a "sea", for the multitude of people in it, as many waters in this book signify people and nations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>; and to a sea of glass, which is brittle, for the frailty and transitoriness of the world, of the fashion of it, and of men and things in it; and to the clear "crystal", because all things in it are open and manifest to the omniscient eye of God; but the world, and men of it, used not to be compared to a still and quiet sea, as this is, but to one disturbed and troubled by winds and tempests, whose waters cast up mire and dirt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>. Others think the ordinance of baptism is designed, of which the Red sea, through which the Israelites passed under the cloud, was an emblem; and which may be compared to a "sea of glass", for its transparency, it clearly expressing the sufferings, burial, and resurrection of Christ; and to crystal, for its purity; and to all this for its cleansing nature, as it leads unto the blood of Christ; and its being before the throne may denote its being the way of entrance into the Gospel church. Others think the blood of Christ is meant, in allusion to the brazen sea in the tabernacle, which was made of the looking glasses the women brought, and for the priests to wash in, before they entered on business, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>, and to the molten sea in the temple, which was for the same purpose, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>. Christ's blood is the fountain opened to wash in for sin, and may be compared to a sea for its abundant efficacy in cleansing from all sin; and it is this which makes way to the throne, and to him that sits on it; and is a special privilege enjoyed by those who come to Mount Zion, or into a Gospel church state; there is always this laver to wash their garments in, and make them white: though this sea, being of glass, seems not so much designed to wash in; and therefore rather I think by it is meant the Gospel, compared to a "sea" for the deep things of God and mysteries of grace which are in it; to a sea of "glass", because in it is beheld, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, of his person, office, and righteousness, as well as many other wondrous things; and to one like "crystal", for the clearness, perspicuity, and evidence of the truths contained in it; and to a, fixed, still; and quiet sea, because it is the Gospel of peace, love, grace, and mercy, and brings peace, joy, and tranquillity to troubled minds, when the law works wrath: but here are no tossing, foaming, raging waves of wrath, and fury, but all smooth, stable, solid, tranquil, and quiet. And this is said to be before the throne, where the rainbow of the covenant is, of which the Gospel is a transcript; and where the four and twenty elders, or members of churches be, for their delight and comfort; and where the seven spirits of God are, to furnish men with gifts to preach it; and where the four living creatures, or ministers of the word, have their place, who officiate in it. Agreeably to this figurative way of speaking, the Jews call (p) the law, , "the sea of the law", and the "sea of wisdom"; and frequently give the characters of such and such a doctor, as being very expert and conversant , "in the sea of the Talmud", or "doctrine" (q). The Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions, read, "there was as a sea of glass", somewhat that looked like one. The word "glass" is left out in the Ethiopic version, but very aptly is it so described, the colour of the sea being sometimes green like that of glass. <p>And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts; or "living creatures", as the word may be better rendered, agreeably to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5</a>, to which reference is here had; and by whom are meant not the angels, though there are many things which agree with them; they are said to be the "four spirits" of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>. They may be rightly called living creatures, since they live a most happy life in heaven; their situation is before the throne, and in the presence of God; and their being so sedulous, diligent, and watchful in doing the will of God, may be signified by their being "full of eyes behind, and before, and within"; their strength may be fitly expressed by "the lion"; their indefatigableness in the service of God, by "the ox": their wisdom, prudence, and knowledge, by "the face of a man"; and their swiftness in obeying the divine commands by "the flying eagle"; their number of wings agrees with that of the seraphim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>; to which the allusion seems to be; and their work, in continually ascribing glory to God, suits with them: to which may be added, that the Jews often speak of four angels, , "round about his throne", that is, the throne of God; whose names are Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael; the three first they place in this manner, Michael at his right hand, Uriel at his left, and Gabriel before him (r). Sometimes thus, Michael on his right hand, Gabriel on his left, Uriel before him, and Raphael behind him, and the holy blessed God in the middle; and they are expressly called (s) by them the four living creatures, meaning in Ezekiel's vision; and they make mention of the intellectual living creatures which are , "round about the throne" (t). Notwithstanding all this, the angels cannot be intended, because these four living creatures are said to be redeemed by the blood of Christ, and are distinguished from angels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>; nor are the four Gospels, with the four evangelists, here meant; for whatever agreement may be fancied there is between these, and the likeness of the living creatures; as that Matthew may be signified by the creature that has the face of a man, because he begins his Gospel with the genealogy of Christ, as man; and Mark by the lion, because he begins his Gospel with the voice of one crying in the wilderness; and Luke by the ox, because he begins his Gospel with an account of Zacharias the priest, offering in the temple; and John by the eagle, because he begins his Gospel, the first face or leaf of it, in a very high style, and with the divinity of Christ: and with what truth soever it may be said of these that they are full of divine light and knowledge, and swiftly spread it in the world, and are continually giving glory to God; yet it cannot be said of them, with any propriety, as is said of these four living creatures, that they fall down before God, and worship him, and are redeemed by the blood of the Lamb: besides, these four are represented as calling to John at the opening of the first four seals, to come and see what was to be seen; and one of them is said to give to the seven angels the vials of wrath to pour out, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>, to which may be added, that this sense is attended with this inconvenience, that it makes John to be one of the four creatures which he saw: nor are four particular apostles, as Peter and John, Paul and Barnabas, pointed at, as others think; nor the pure apostolical church, for the church is represented by the four and twenty elders, and these four living creatures are distinguished from the hundred and forty four thousand on Mount Zion, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>. Dr. Goodwin has a very ingenious thought upon these words, could it be supported; he thinks that these four living creatures design the four officers in the Christian church, the ruling elder, the pastor, the deacon, and the teacher; the ruling elder by the "lion", who needs courage to deal with men in case of sins; the pastor by the "ox", for his laboriousness in treading out the corn; the deacon by that which has the "face of a man", it being necessary that he should be merciful and pitiful to the poor, as is the heart of a man; and the teacher by the "flying eagle", who is quick to espy errors, and soars aloft into high mysteries: but then it should be observed, that there is no such officer ass ruling elder in the church, distinct from the pastor; and that the pastor and teacher are one; so that there are but two sorts of officers in the church, pastor, and deacon; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; to which may be added, that the four living creatures are all in the same situation, and are alike full of eyes, and have the same number of wings, and are employed in the same work; all which cannot be said equally of church officers. By these four living creatures, I apprehend, we are to understand the ministers of the Gospel in general, in the successive ages of the church, to whom all the characters do well agree. And though they may not be all found in everyone, at least not in all alike, yet thou are in one or another of them, and in them as together considered. They are said to be "four", being fewer in number than the members of the church, which are signified by the twenty four elders, and yet a sufficient number; and in allusion to the four standards of the camp of Israel in the wilderness, to which there seems to be some reference in the whole of this account; as the tabernacle there was placed in the midst, so the throne of God here; as the priests and Levites were round about that, so the four and twenty elders here; as there were seven lamps, over against the candlestick in the tabernacle, continually burning, so there are seven spirits here before the throne; and as there were four princes, who were standard bearers, placed at the four corners of the camp, so here four living creatures, or ministers of the word, who are standard bearers: the standard of Judah, with Issachar and Zabulon under him, was at the east of the tabernacle; and Ephraim, with Manasseh and Benjamin, at the west; Reuben, with Simeon and Gad, at the south; and Dan, with Asher and Naphtali, at the north; and the Jewish writers say (u), that on Judah's standard was the figure of a lion, on Ephraim's the figure of an ox, on Reuben's the figure of a man, and on Dan's the figure of an eagle; and to which the four living creatures are likened here. And this number "four" may be the rather mentioned, with respect to the four parts of the world, and corners of the earth, whither the ministers of the Gospel are sent to preach, and whither their commission reaches; there being of the elect of God in all parts to be gathered in by their ministry: and very properly may they be called "living creatures", because they are alive in themselves, being quickened by the Spirit of God; or otherwise they would not be fit for their work; and because their work requires liveliness in the exercise of grace, and fervency in the performance of duty: and because they are a means in the hand of God of quickening dead sinners, and of reviving drooping saints by the word of life, which they hold forth: the situation of these four living creatures agrees with them, who are said to be both in the midst of, and round about the throne, and so were nearer to it than the four and twenty elders, and were between that and them; as the ministers of the Gospel are set in the first place in the church; have nearness to God, and much of his presence, which is particularly promised them; and stand between God and the people, and receive from the one, and communicate to the other, and lead on the worship of God, as these four do; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9</a>. And these are said to be <p>full of eyes; of spiritual light, and evangelical knowledge; and they have need of all the eyes they have to look into the Scriptures of truth, to search and pry into them, and find out the sense and meaning of them; to overlook the flock committed to them, they have taken the oversight of; to look to themselves, their doctrine, and their conversation; to espy enemies and dangers, and give notice of them to the churches; to look to God upon the throne, and to the Lamb in the midst of it, for fresh supplies of gifts and grace; and to see to it, that all their ministrations tend to the glory of God, the honour of a Redeemer, and the good of souls. And they had eyes <p>before and behind; "before" them, to look to the word of God, and the deep things in it, which continually lies before them, and to the things that are yet to come relating to the kingdom and church of Christ; and "behind" them, to observe how all sacrifices and types, predictions and promises, have had their accomplishment in Christ; they have eyes before them to watch over the church they are in the midst of, and which is the flock that is before them; and eyes behind, to guard against Satan and his emissaries, false teachers, who sometimes slyly and secretly come upon the back of them; they have eyes before them, to look to him that sits upon the throne, on whom their dependence, and from whom their expectations are; and they have eyes behind them, to look on the four and twenty elders, the members of the churches, to whom they minister. <p>(p) Zohar in Numb. fol. 90. 3. &amp; 92. 1. &amp; in Lev. fol. 24. 3. &amp; in Deut. fol. 118. 4.

What John further beheld before the throne of God appeared as a sea of glass like crystal. This is regarded as signifying baptism,[1761] the Holy Scriptures,[1762] repentance,[1763] the present transitory world,[1764] etc.,—all purely arbitrary. Without ground, further, is the allusion to the “brazen sea” in the temple,[1765] or to the bright inlaid floor, having, therefore, the appearance of a sea.[1766] It is in general a conception not justified by the text, to regard the “sea of glass “the basis of the throne, as C. a Lap., Vitr., Eichh., Heinr., Herder, De Wette, etc., presuppose, who from this same idea reach interpretations that are very different. With an appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm" title="And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.">Ezekiel 1:26</a>, De Wette[1767] regards “the sea of glass” in our passage, as well as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>, as a designation of “the atmosphere,” an explanation to which, in its pure naturalness, Exodus and Ezekiel do not apply,—where, however, in reality the pure ether is the natural substratum for the idea of the standing or enthronement of God in heavenly glory,—while in this passage the sea of glass is not <span class="ital">beneath</span>, but <span class="ital">before</span>, the throne of God, and the entire presentation is altogether foreign to “the atmosphere.” On the other hand, Vitr., Herder, etc., with a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-15.htm" title="Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of your countenance.">Psalm 89:15</a>, and similar passages, interpret the sea of glass as the basis of righteousness and grace, whereon the throne of God is founded.[1768] Following Beng., Hengstenb. has understood the sea of glass, since it appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a> mingled with fire, as the “<span class="ital">product</span> of the seven lamps of fire,” since and because of the expression “sea” referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-7.htm" title="How excellent is your loving kindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of your wings.">Psalm 36:7</a>, as a designation of “the great and wonderful works of God, of his just and holy ways, of his acts of righteousness that have become manifest.” But already the parallelism of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>, where these seven lamps appear as seven eyes, in itself renders this artificial interpretation impossible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Aret., Grot., and Ebrard proceed upon the fact that the sea, viz., as stormy and irregularly heaving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>), represents the mass of the nations in their ungodly state; and then, that the sea of glass, clear as crystal, and therefore firm as well as pure, designates “the creature in its pure relation to the Creator.”[1769] But this interpretation is wrecked on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.">Revelation 15:2</a>. According to that passage,[1770] the sea, whose complete, heavenly purity is marked by the double designation, <span class="greekheb">ὑαλ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ὁμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κρυστ</span>.,[1771] is to be regarded identical with the stream of the water of life, which[1772] proceeds from the throne of God.[1773] The point thus designated belongs in fact essentially to the perfection of the view of the enthroned God; and according to the living relation in which the vision, ch. 4 [and 5], stands to all that follows, it is to be expected, that, as the succeeding judgments appear as the work of the holy and just omnipotence of the heavenly King here described, so also a definite point of the present fundamental description corresponds to the final glorious and blessed completion of the kingdom of God. Since in the presence of God there is fulness of joy,[1774] since God is the Blessed One,[1775] since before him and from him issues the river of eternal life, he himself, and communion with him, is the blessed goal for the development of his kingdom, and he himself is the leader thereto. [See Note XLIII., p. 203.] <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ θρόνου καὶ κύκλῳ τοῦ θρόνου τέσσαρα ζῶα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

In either case, the notion is repeated by parallelism in the next clause, "like unto crystal." But the glassy sea may mean "a glass laver," and bear no reference to what is usually called a sea. The brazen laver is described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>) as a "molten sea." St. John may therefore mean that before the throne of God was a laver of the purest material, just as the brazen laver was before the temple. One difficulty here presents itself, viz. that there would be no use for a laver in heaven, where all is pure, and the figure therefore appears a little incongruous. But as it stood <span class="accented">before</span> the throne, where all who came would have to pass by, it may fitly typify the waters of Baptism, passed by all Christians; and the figure would be aptly suggested to St. John by the furniture of the temple to which he has such constant allusions. <span class="cmt_word">And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne</span>. This may mean either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, the throne being rectangular, the four living beings were in the middle of each side of the parallelogram; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> while one was in front of the throne, the other three formed a semicircle round it, one being directly behind, and two towards the ends. <span class="cmt_word">Were four beasts;</span> <span class="accented">or, four living creatures</span> (Revised Version); or, better still, <span class="accented">four living beings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>). The "beast" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-7.htm">Revelation 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, etc., must not be confounded with the "living ones" of this passage. The one quality connoted by the term here used is the possession of life. The question of the precise meaning and interpretation of the vision of "the living beings" is a difficult one, and much has been written concerning it. The vision is evidently connected with the appearances described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and 10, and which are called in Isaiah "seraphim," in Ezekiel "cherubim." We are led, therefore, to inquire what mental ideas were pictured to the Jews under the symbolical forms of cherubim and seraphim. Cheyne shows ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 2. p. 272) that the name <span class="accented">cherub</span> is probably connected with <span class="accented">kirubu</span>, the winged ox god of the Assyrians, and with <span class="accented">kurubu</span>, the vulture or eagle (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the guardians of the treasures of the gods); and he infers that among heathen nations the mythic cherubim denote the cloud-masses which appear to guard the portals of the sky, and on which the sun-god issues at break of day. With regard to the seraphim, he compares the name of the fiery serpents(<span class="accented">s'rafim</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, and concludes that the term was symbolical of the lightning, the weapon of the gods. Now, in Old Testament passages the cherubim and seraphim are always pictured as the attendants of God, and the workers of his purposes and judgments - an idea which may readily have been assimilated by the Jews from the conceptions of their heathen neighbours. Thus cherubim with the flaming sword are placed at the entrance of the garden of Eden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); Jehovah rode upon a cherub, and did fly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>); he communes with his people from between the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>); he is the Shepherd of Israel, who dwells between the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>); the temple in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> is adorned with cherubim, as being the dwelling-place of God; they are the attendants of the glory of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22-28</a>; and the seraphim fill an analogous position (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). We may therefore infer that the appearance of the "living beings" implied the presence of some order of beings in attendance upon God, the workers of his will, and the manifestation of his glory. Again, the term used (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>) and the characteristics of the appearance naturally and almost irresistibly lead us to interpret the form as one symbolical of <span class="accented">life.</span> The human face, the ox as the representative of domestic, and the lion of wild animals, and the eagle among birds, appear to be typical of the four most conspicuous orders of animal life. The ceaseless movements described in ver. 8 portray the same idea. The four living beings draw attention to the woes heaped upon created life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). The <span class="accented">eyes</span> denote never-resting activity. We may therefore believe that the living beings are symbolical of all creation fulfilling its proper office - waiting upon God, fulfilling his will, and setting forth his glory. It is noteworthy that the human face, as distinct from the Church, which is represented by the four and twenty elders, appears to indicate the power of God to use, for his purposes and his glory, that part of mankind which has not been received into the Church - the part which constitutes the "other sheep, not of this fold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>). These representatives of created life worship God, and give (ver. 11), as a reason for ascribing glory and honour to him, the circumstance that "thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created." The following are other interpretations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The living beings represent the four Gospels. This view is held by many ancient writers, though there are many variations in assigning to each Gospel its own representative. Victorinus considers the <span class="accented">man</span> to be a type of St. Matthew, who sets forth prominently the human nature of our Lord; the kingly <span class="accented">lion</span> is referred to St. Mark; the sacrificial ox to St. Luke; the aspiring <span class="accented">eagle</span> to St. John. Amongst the supporters of this interpretation (though varying in the precise applicability) are St. Augustine, St. Jerome, St. Athanasius, St. Irenaeus, St. Gregory, St. Ambrose, Andreas, Primasius, Bede, I. Williams, Wordsworth (for a lull exposition of this view, see <span class="accented">Wordsworth, in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The four great apostles: St. Peter, the lion; James the brother of the Lord, the ox; St. Matthew, the man; St. Paul, the eagle (Grotius). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Church of the New Testament; as the Church of the Old Testament was represented by the standards or four tribes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.), on which these devices were emblazoned according to tradition (Mede). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The four patriarchal Churches: the <span class="accented">man</span>, Alexandria, famed for learning; <span class="accented">the lion</span>, Jerusalem, <span class="accented">"propter</span> constantiam" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>); the <span class="accented">ox</span>, Antioch, as "parata obedire mandatis apostolorum;" the <span class="accented">eagle</span>, Constantinople, remarkable for men "per contemplationem elevati, ut Grog.

The adjective, and the kindred noun &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; glass occur only in Revelation. The etymology is uncertain; some maintaining an Egyptian origin, and others referring it to the Greek &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9; to rain, with the original signification of rain-drop. Originally, some kind of clear, transparent stone. Herodotus says that the Ethiopians place their dead bodies "in a crystal pillar which has been hollowed out to receive them, crystal being dug up in great abundance in their country, and of a kind very easy to work. You may see the corpse through the pillar within which it lies; and it neither gives out any unpleasant odor, nor is it in any respect unseemly: yet there is no part that is not as plainly visible as if the body were bare" (iii., 24). Glass is known to have been made in Egypt at least 3,800 years ago. The monuments show that the same glass bottles were used then as in later times; and glass blowing is represented in the paintings in the tombs. The Egyptians possessed the art of coloring it, and of introducing gold between two layers of glass. The ruins of glass-furnaces are still to be seen at the Natron Lakes. The glass of Egypt was long famous. It was much used at Rome for ornamental purposes, and a glass window has been discovered at Pompeii: Pliny speaks of glass being malleable.<p>Crystal<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-18.htm">Job 37:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>. The word is used in classical Greek for ice. Thucydides, describing the attempt of the Plataeans to break out from their city when besieged by the Peloponnesians and Boeotians, relates their climbing over the wall and crossing the ditch, but only after a hard struggle; "for the ice (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) in it was not frozen hard enough to bear" (iii., 23). Crystal, regarded as a mineral, was originally held to be only pure water congealed, by great length of time, into ice harder than common. Hence it was believed that it could be produced only in regions of perpetual ice.<p>In the midst of - round about<p>Commonly explained as one in the midst of each of the four sides of the throne.
