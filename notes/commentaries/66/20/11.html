It is a white throne, in token of the purity of the judgment which follows. He who sits upon it is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. It is asked, Who is He that is seated here? Throughout the book God is called “Him that sitteth upon the throne” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm" title="And he that sat was to look on like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like to an emerald.">Revelation 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm" title="And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.">Revelation 5:1</a>); but we must not understand this as excluding the Son of God, who sits with His Father on His throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>), and who, as Son of Man, declared that He would sit upon the throne of His glory and divide “all the nations” as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31-32</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15-18</a>). At the face of Him who sits upon the throne the heaven and earth flee. Hengstenberg interprets this of the putting out of the way “all of the irrational creation which had been pressed into the service of sin.” Gebhardt interprets it of “the <span class= "ital">destruction</span> of the whole <span class= "ital">present</span> visible <span class= "ital">world.”</span> A comparison, however, of the imagery employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/6-12.htm" title="And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, see, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;">Revelation 6:12-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19-20</a>, should make us cautious of asserting that any great physical catastrophe is described here.

Some physical revolutions do in all probability await our earth, but the eye of the prophet looks more to the moral and spiritual regeneration of the world—more to the spiritual well-being of mankind, than to any physical changes which may synchronise with the culmination of the world’s moral history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a></span>. The course of these prophecies, after many important visions describing the state of the church and world in this present life, brings us at last to the great and final judgment, when the whole scene and mystery of Providence shall be finished. Then the great doctrine which runs through the whole of these prophecies will be fully verified, namely, that truth and righteousness shall surely prevail in the end, against error and all iniquity; eternal happiness shall be the reward of the faithful, and everlasting destruction the punishment of the wicked. This is represented as a sixth period of Providence, after which there will be in the seventh period an everlasting sabbath; a state of eternal rest and happiness for all the righteous, and of the most perfect worship of God, in the praises and devotions of the heavenly church. — Lowman. <span class="ital">And I saw — </span>A representation of the great day of the Lord; <span class="ital">a great white throne </span>— How great who can say? <span class="ital">White </span>— With the glory of God, and to show the holiness, justice, and equity of him that sits on it, the Lord Jesus.

This will be the great day: the Judge, the Lord Jesus Christ, will then put on majesty and terror. The persons to be judged are the dead, small and great; young and old, low and high, poor and rich. None are so mean, but they have some talents to account for; and none so great, as to avoid having to account for them. Not only those alive at the coming of Christ, but all the dead. There is a book of remembrance both for good and bad: and the book of the sinner's conscience, though formerly secret, will then be opened. Every man will recollect all his past actions, though he had long forgotten many of them. Another book shall be opened, the book of the Scriptures, the rule of life; it represents the Lord's knowledge of his people, and his declaring their repentance, faith, and good works; showing the blessings of the new covenant. By their works men shall be justified or condemned; he will try their principles by their practices. Those justified and acquitted by the gospel, shall be justified and acquitted by the Judge, and shall enter into eternal life, having nothing more to fear from death, or hell, or wicked men; for these are all destroyed together. This is the second death; it is the final separation of sinners from God. Let it be our great concern to see whether our Bibles justify or condemn us now; for Christ will judge the secrets of all men according to the gospel.

The first thing seen in the vision is the burning throne of the Judge. The things that are specified in regard to it are, that it was "great," and that it was "white." The former expression means that it was high or elevated. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>. The latter expression - white - means that it was "splendid or shining." Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>. The throne here is the same which is referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, and called there "the throne of his glory."<p>And him that sat on it - The reference here undoubtedly is to the Lord Jesus Christ, the final Judge of mankind (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>), and the scene described is what will occur at his second advent.<p>From whose face - Or, from whose presence; though the word may be used here to denote more strictly his face - as illuminated, and shining like the sun. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, "And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength."<p>The earth and the heaven fled away - That is, as the stars, at the rising of the sun, seem to flee to more remote regions, and vanish from human view, so when the Son of God shall descend in his glory to judge the world, the earth and all other worlds shall seem to vanish. Every one must admire the sublimity of this image; no one can contemplate it without being awed by the majesty and glory of the final Judge of mankind. Similar expressions, where the natural creation shrinks back with awe at the presence of God, frequently occur in the Bible. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7-15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3-5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10-11</a>.<p>And there was found no place for them - They seemed to flee "entirely away," as if there was "no" place where they could find a safe retreat, or which would receive and shelter them in their flight. The image expresses, in the most emphatic manner, the idea that they entirely disappeared, and no language could more sublimely represent the majesty of the Judge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. great&#8212;in contrast to the "thrones," Re 20:4.<p>white&#8212;the emblem of purity and justice.<p>him that sat on it&#8212;the Father [Alford]. Rather, the Son, to whom "the Father hath committed all judgment." God in Christ, that is, the Father represented by the Son, is He before whose judgment-seat we must all stand. The Son's mediatorial reign is with a view to prepare the kingdom for the Father's acceptance. When He has done that, He shall give it up to the Father, "that God may be all in all," coming into direct communion with His creatures, without intervention of a Mediator, for the first time since the fall. Heretofore Christ's Prophetical mediation had been prominent in His earthly ministry, His Priestly mediation is prominent now in heaven between His first and second advents, and His Kingly shall be so during the millennium and at the general judgment.<p>earth and heaven fled away&#8212;The final conflagration, therefore, precedes the general judgment.

This vision refers not to the Gospel dispensation, from the exaltation of Christ to his second coming; when he sat down on his throne at the right hand of God, and was declared Lord and Christ; when there was a shaking of the heavens and the earth, a removing of the Mosaic economy, and the ordinances of the ceremonial law in Judea, and of Paganism in the Gentile world; when the Gospel was preached to all nations, and the dead in sins were quickened, and arose and stood before the throne of grace; when the books of the Scriptures were opened and explained, and the book of life was also opened; and by the conversion of some, and not others, it was known who were written in it and who were not, and men were judged to be alive or dead in a spiritual sense, according to the influence the opening of these books had upon them; and the powers of the world, comparable to a sea, and of death and hell, were not able to hold in the dead in sin, when they were called to life, with respect to whom death and hell were destroyed; nor was the Gospel the savour of death to any but to such who were not written in the book of life. This, in other words, is the sum of Cocceius's sense of this vision; but this affair will be over, and all God's elect gathered in by the preaching of the Gospel, before this vision takes place: nor does it respect the restoration of the Jews, who now are as dead, like Ezekiel's dry bones, but will at this time be quickened, and stand upon their feet an exceeding great army, and will be gathered from the several parts where they are as dead; and when it will be known by their conduct and behaviour who are God's elect among them, and who are not; which is Brightman's interpretation of the vision: but this, as we have seen, will come to pass according to the vision in the preceding chapter, before the thousand years begin; whereas this vision will not begin to be accomplished until they are ended: it is best therefore to understand it of the general judgment at the last day, which is the common sense of ancient and modern interpreters; though it seems only to regard the judgment of the wicked, for no other are made mention of in it: the "throne" here seen is a throne of judgment; it is called a "great" one, because a great Person sat upon it, the Word of God, the King of kings and Lord of lords, even he who is the great God, and Judge of the whole earth; and because of the great work that will be transacted upon it, the judgment of all the wicked; this will be the greatest assize that ever was held; it is called the judgment of the great day, and the great and dreadful day of the Lord, Jde 1:6, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a> this throne is also said to be a "white" one; just as the same Person is said to sit upon a white cloud, and ride upon a white horse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a> it may be in allusion either to a white and serene cloud, or to a throne of ivory, such an one as Solomon made, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-17.htm">2 Chronicles 9:17</a> and this is either expressive of the majesty and splendour of it, it being a throne of glory, or a glorious throne, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> or else it may denote the purity and justice of him that sits on it, according to which he will proceed in judgment, and finish it; his character is the righteous judge, and the judgment he will execute will be righteous judgment: <p>and him that sat on it; the throne was not empty, one sat upon it, who is no other than the Son of God; to whom all judgment is committed, and who is ordained to be Judge of quick and dead; and is every way fit for it, being of great knowledge, wisdom, and sagacity, and of great integrity and faithfulness, as man and Mediator, and being, as God, both omniscient and omnipotent, and so capable both of passing a right sentence, and of executing it; to which may be added, his great majesty and glory, necessary to strike an awe, and command an attention to him: <p>from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away, and there was found no place for them; which is to be understood not figuratively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a> where in the one place is described the destruction of Paganism, and in the other the destruction of the Papacy, and all antichristian powers; but literally, and not of the present earth and heaven, as they now are, for these will be burnt up with fire at the beginning of the thousand years, but of the new heaven and new earth, at the end of them; and the phrases of fleeing away, and place being found no more for them, show the entire annihilation and utter abolition of them; after this there will be no place in being but the heaven of angels and saints, and the lake of fire, in which are the devils and damned spirits: but though this is mentioned here, it will not be till after the judgment is over; for how otherwise will the dead have a place to stand in before the throne, or hell, that is the grave, and also the sea, give up their dead, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a> but it is observed here, though afterwards done, to set off the majesty of the Judge upon the throne, at whose sight, and by whose power, this will be effected. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{19}</span> And I saw a great <span class="cverse3">{20}</span> white throne, and him that sat on it, <span class="cverse3">{21}</span> from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away;

The more manifest this is as an exhaustive designation of <span class="ital">all</span> places of concealment of the dead, the more perverted appears the assertion of Hengstenberg and Ebrard,[4238] that the <span class="greekheb">θάλασσα</span> means not the actual sea, but only “the sea of nations;”[4239] but from the text (<span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ θάν</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἅδης</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm" title="And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.">Revelation 20:14</a>), it does not, therefore, follow that John seriously advocated the view according to which those contained in the sea had not reached Hades.[4240] John does not indeed refer to a wandering of souls in a watery grave, but simply represents those lying dead in the sea as coming forth from the same. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-13.htm" title="And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.">Revelation 20:13</a>, that is described which, according to the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.">Revelation 20:5</a>, may be termed the second resurrection. Since <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.

But from this it does not follow that <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>, in its clearly designated entirety of <span class="ital">all</span> the (risen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.

Moreover, the description of the Great Assize here is substantially the same as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire....">Daniel 7:9-10</a> : and there the Ancient of Days, Who sits on the throne, is plainly distinguished from the Son of Man. Therefore we are no doubt to understand the presence of the Father here, in spite of St <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm" title="For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:">John 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm" title="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a>. There is no contradiction, if we take a duly high view of the relation between the Father and the Son. St Paul’s doctrine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a> (allowing that <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm" title="Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;">Titus 2:13</a> is ambiguous), shews the accurate relation between the two sides of the truth: and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>, compared with our Lord’s own words in St <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a> and parallels, shews the propriety of this image.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from whose face</span> &c.] The passing away of earth and heaven is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-6.htm" title="Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.">Isaiah 51:6</a>, St <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.">Matthew 24:35</a> and parallels; but the strong expression of their fleeing before God’s presence is peculiar to this place: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm" title="He looks on the earth, and it trembles: he touches the hills, and they smoke.">Psalm 104:32</a>, however, is something of a precedent. That the destruction will be by fire is not stated here, or anywhere but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2 Peter 3:12</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,...">2 Thessalonians 1:7-8</a>. In St Peter l.c. we have this destruction of the world by fire compared with the destruction by the Flood, and this parallel seems to have been recognised in popular Jewish belief. Popular Christian belief continued the series, by interpolating between the two a purely mythical “flood of wind;” an idea also found, curiously enough, in the Mexican mythology, which completed the elemental series with a destruction by earthquakes. The lesson of all this seems to be, that the Deluge is a matter of universal tradition, and that the destructibility of the world is recognised by a universal instinct: but that the <span class="ital">manner</span> of its destruction is not so revealed, that it can safely be conceived by us in picturesque detail. The destruction of our globe, perhaps of the whole solar system, by fire is quite within the bounds of possibility, even according to the known laws of nature; but those laws more naturally suggest the world literally “waxing old like a garment, and them that dwell therein dying like a moth,” and the elements rather congealing with cold than “melting with fervent heat.” On the other hand, passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm" title="And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm" title="I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;">2 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-5.htm" title="Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.">1 Peter 4:5</a> seem plainly to prove that the human race will not be extinct when that Day comes, but that there will be “the quick” as well as “the dead” ready to undergo the Judgement. But the judgement of the dead only is described here. St John had learnt, as St Paul had not, that the dead would be the larger class of the two: whether he learnt it from his own longer life, or from the length of time implied in this vision.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and there was found no place for them</span>] The phrase is a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-35.htm" title="Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.">Daniel 2:35</a>; we had a similar one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-8.htm" title="And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.">Revelation 12:8</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/revelation/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>) Up to this time there has been a description of the events which are to be accomplished between the day of John’s vision and the last day.

In the meantime, according to the guidance of the Apocalypse, you may not inappropriately distinguish the centuries from the time of John in Patmos to our own age by the following characteristics:The birth of Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cent. 2. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Destruction of Judaism, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Inroad of the Barbarians, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Revelation 8. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">Arian</span> age: the Arian bitterness, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Revelation 10. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Overthrow of the Empire of Rome, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Revelation 12. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Jewish Synagogue tormented, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Saracen cavalry, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Revelation 13. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>8. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">Iconoclastic</span> age: many Kings, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.">Revelation 10:11</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>9. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The age of <span class="ital">Photius:</span> the Ruler of the nations also born, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-5.htm" title="And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.">Revelation 12:5</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>10. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">Disastrous</span> age: the third woe, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Revelation 12. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>11. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The age of <span class="ital">Hildebrand:</span> the rising of the beast out of the sea, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>12. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">Waldensian</span> age: Power given to the beast, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Revelation 5. <a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw a great white throne.</span> <span class="accented">And I saw</span>; introducing a new phase of the vision (el. ver. 1, etc.).

Perhaps from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a> we must infer that God the Son is meant. The destruction of the world is complete - "no place is found for them;" they are annihilated. Such an event is nearly always portrayed in the description of the last judgment in the Apocalypse and in the New Testament generally (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-20.htm">Revelation 16:20</a>). </body></html>
