It is the figure of the true spiritual Zion and Jerusalem which has been faithful to her king. The beloved city has its camp; it is ready for war. It has waged its spiritual warfare against all forms of evil, Its citizens, like the returned exiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/4-17.htm" title="They which built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.">Nehemiah 4:17-18</a>), could never lay down the sword (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-14.htm" title="And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:">John 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-4.htm" title="For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.">John 5:4</a>); but the hostile demonstration is arrested by divine intervention. <span class= "ital">There came down fire out of the heaven</span> (the words “from God” are of doubtful authority) <span class= "ital">and devoured them.</span> The Shechinah light tabernacled over the holy city. Its light was also a flame ready to break forth upon the wicked.

And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill.

It must be remembered that, in the passage before us, the prophet is using the incidents and actions of the past as imagery, and that the present vision is figurative, though of course not mere empty figure: for Christ will thoroughly purge His floor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:7-10 While this world lasts, Satan's power in it will not be wholly destroyed, though it may be limited and lessened. No sooner is Satan let loose, than he again begins deceiving the nations, and stirring them up to make war with the saints and servants of God. It would be well if the servants and ministers of Christ were as active and persevering in doing good, as his enemies in doing mischief. God will fight this last and decisive battle for his people, that the victory may be complete, and the glory be to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they went up on the breadth of the earth - They spread over the earth in extended columns. The image is that of an invading army that seems, in its march, to spread all over a land. The reference here is to the hosts assembled from the regions of Gog and Magog; that is, to the formidable enemies of the gospel that would be roused up at the close of the period properly called the "millennial" period - the period of the thousand years. It is not necessary to suppose that there would be "literally" armies of enemies of God summoned from lands that would be called lands of "Gog and Magog"; but all that is necessarily implied is, that there will be a state of hostility to the church of Christ which would be well illustrated by such a comparison with an invading host of barbarians. The expression "the breadth of the land" occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>, in a description. of the invasion of the Chaldeans, and means there "the whole extent of it"; that is, they would spread over the whole country.<p>And compassed the camp of the saints about - Besieged the camp of the saints considered as engaged in war, or as attacked by an enemy. The "camp of the saints" here seems to be supposed to be without the walls of the city; that is, the army was drawn out for defense. The fact that the foes were able to "compass this camp about," and to encircle the city at the same time, shows the greatness of the numbers of the invaders.<p>And the beloved city - Jerusalem - a city represented as beloved by God and by his people. The whole imagery here is derived from a supposed invasion of the land of Palestine - imagery than which nothing could be more natural to John in describing the hostility that would be aroused against the church in the latter day. But no just principle of interpretation requires us to understand this "literally." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>. Indeed, it would be absolutely "impossible" to give this chapter throughout a "literal" interpretation. What would be the "literal" interpretation of the very first verses? "I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the "key" of the bottomless pit, and "a great chain" in his hand; and he laid hold on the "dragon and bound" him." Can anyone believe that there is to be a literal "key," and a "chain," and an act of seizing a "serpent," and "binding" him? As little is it demanded that the passage before us should be taken "literally"; for if it is maintained that this should be, we may insist that the same principle of interpretation should be applied to every part of the chapter, and every part of the book.<p>And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them - Consumed them - fire being represented as devouring or eating. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a>. The meaning is, that they would be destroyed as if fire should come down from heaven, as on Sodom and Gomorrah. But it is not necessary to understand this literally, anymore than it is the portions of the chapter just referred to. What is obviously meant is, that their destruction would be sudden, certain, and entire, and that thus the last enemy of God and the church would be swept away. Nothing can be determined from this about the "means" by which this destruction will be effected; and that must be left for time to disclose. It is sufficient to know that the destruction of these last foes of God and the church will be certain and entire. This "language," as denoting the final destruction of the enemies of God, is often employed in the Scriptures. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. on the breadth of the earth&#8212;so as completely to overspread it. Perhaps we ought to translate, "&#8230; of the [holy] land."<p>the camp of the saints and the beloved city&#8212;the camp of the saints encircling the beloved city, Jerusalem (Ecclesiasticus 24:11). Contrast "hateful" in Babylon (Re 18:2; De 32:15, Septuagint). Ezekiel's prophecy of Gog and Magog (Eze 38:1-39:29) refers to the attack made by Antichrist on Israel before the millennium: but this attack is made after the millennium, so that "Gog and Magog" are mystical names representing the final adversaries led by Satan in person. Ezekiel's Gog and Magog come from the north, but those here come "from the four corners of the earth." Gog is by some connected with a Hebrew root, "covered."<p>from God&#8212;so B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and Andreas. But A omits the words. Even during the millennium there is a separation between heaven and earth, transfigured humanity and humanity in the flesh. Hence it is possible that an apostasy should take place at its close. In the judgment on this apostasy the world of nature is destroyed and renewed, as the world of history was before the millennial kingdom; it is only then that the new heaven and new earth are realized in final perfection. The millennial new heaven and earth are but a foretaste of this everlasting state when the upper and lower congregations shall be no longer separate, though connected as in the millennium, and when new Jerusalem shall descend from God out of heaven. The inherited sinfulness of our nature shall be the only influence during the millennium to prevent the power of the transfigured Church saving all souls. When this time of grace shall end, no other shall succeed. For what can move him in whom the visible glory of the Church, while the influence of evil is restrained, evokes no longing for communion with the Church's King? As the history of the world of nations ended with the manifestation of the Church in visible glory, so that of mankind in general shall end with the great separation of the just from the wicked (Re 20:12) [Auberlen].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And they went up on the breadth of the earth; </span> that is, in all parts of it where the church of Christ was. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city; </span> the church of God (typified by old Jerusalem, which was God’s beloved city) they encompassed in a military order and manner, designing to destroy it, or make it subject to their lusts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them:</span> thus Ezekiel prophesied of the issue of the <span class="ital">Gog and Magog</span> by him mentioned, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/38-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, said the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face....">Ezekiel 38:18-22</a></span>: <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm" title="And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain on him, and on his bands, and on the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.">Ezekiel 38:22</a></span>, <span class="ital">And I will plead against him with</span> <span class="ital">pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, </span> <span class="ital">and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and</span> <span class="ital">great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.</span> The meaning is, that God would destroy them with a quick and terrible destruction, such as is that destruction of persons and places which is by fire. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they went up on the breadth of the earth,....

In the Hebrew Elias apocalypse of the 3rd century (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Buttenwieser, <span class="ital">E.

Yet only a new and heavenly Jerusalem is finally adequate (21. f.); it descends after the last punishment and judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a> f. = <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm" title="And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.">Revelation 20:10</a> f.). Wetstein cites from the Targ. Jonath. a passage which has suggested elements in this and in the preceding (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/11-17.htm" title="Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and were, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned....">Revelation 11:17-19</a>) vision: a king rises in the last days from the land of Magog, et omnes populi obedient illi; after their rout by fire their corpses lie a prey to wild beasts and birds. Then “all the dead of Israel shall live … and receive the reward of their works”. In the highest spirit of the O.T., however, John rejects the horrible companion thought (En. lxxxix. 58, xciv. 10, xcvii. 2) that God gloats over the doom of the damned. An onset of foreign nations upon Jerusalem naturally formed a stereotyped feature in all Jewish expectations of latter-day horrors; here, however, as the city is <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> tenanted by holy citizens, the siege is ineffective (contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.">Revelation 11:1</a> f.).

The human tools of the latter die, but they are raised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a> f.) for judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-15.htm" title="And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.">Revelation 20:15</a>), though the result of their trial is a foregone conclusion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/14-9.htm" title="And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,...">Revelation 14:9-10</a>). In En. vi., from which this passage borrows, Gog and Magog are represented by the Medes and the Parthians from whom (between 100 and 46 B.C.) a hostile league against Palestine might have been expected by contemporaries. But the destruction of the troops is there caused by civil dissensions. In our Apocalypse the means of destruction is supernatural fire, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a> Esd. 12:33, 13:38–39, Ap. Bar. xxvii. 10, Asc. Isa. iv. 18 (where fire issues from the Beloved to consume all the godless); the Parthians also appear some time before the end, in the penultimate stage when the Roman empire and its Nero-antichrist make their last attack. But the prophet is still left with the orthodox eschatological tradition of Gog and Magog, an episode (consecrated by the Ezekiel-prophecy and later belief) which he feels obliged to work in somehow. Hence his arrangement of Satan’s final recrudescence in juxtaposition with the Gog and Magog outburst (<span class="ital">cf.</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-16.htm" title="And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.">Revelation 16:16</a>, and Klausner’s <span class="ital">messian. Vorstellungen d. jüd. Volkes im Zeit. d. Tannaiten</span>, pp. 61 f.). The latter, an honoured but by this time awkward survival of archaic eschatology, presented a similar difficulty to the Talmudic theology which variously put it before, or after, the messianic reign (Volz, pp. 175 f.). In his combination of messianic beliefs, John follows the tradition, accepted in Sib. Or. iii. 663 f., which postponed the irruption till after messiah s temporary period of power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>. The connexion of thought depends upon the traditional Jewish scheme outlined, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in Apoc. Bar. xxix.–xxx. (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 4 Esd. 7:29, 30) where the messiah returns in glory to heaven after his reign on earth; the general resurrection follows, accompanied by the judgment. Developing his oracles along these current lines, the prophet now proceeds to depict his culminating vision of the End in three scenes: (1.) the world and its judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them....">Revelation 20:11-15</a>), (2.) the new heaven and earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea....">Revelation 21:1-8</a>), centring round (3.) the new Jerusalem as the final seat of bliss (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>). The last-named phase was associated in eschatology (Sib. Or. ver. 246 f., 414 f.) with the return of Nero redivivus and the downfall of Babylon which preceded the sacred city’s rise. The destruction of hostile forces, followed by the renovation of the universe, is essentially a Persian dogma (Stave, 180 f.), and is paralleled in the Babylonian mythology, where after the defeat and subjugation of Tiâmat in the primeval age creation commences. From this point until <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9</a> f., Jesus is ignored entirely.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">And they went up</span> &c.] The Seer does not pass easily over the immense space of time during which the world is too happy to have a history. He <span class="ital">sees</span> the establishment of the earthly kingdom of Christ, and <span class="ital">foretells</span> its end: it is only gradually that he comes to see the end also brought before his view as present.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the breadth of the earth</span>] Perhaps rather, <span class="bld">of the land</span>; they overspread the whole land of Israel, against which, as we see from the next clause, their attack is directed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the camp of the saints</span>] God’s people assemble in military array, and stand on their defence against His enemies. They are probably prepared to fight, but as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-21.htm" title="And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.">Revelation 19:21</a>, they have no need.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the beloved city</span>] i.e. Jerusalem, which, it appears from this place only, will be the seat and capital of the millennial kingdom. It appears that in the popular millennial anticipations, which discredited the literal interpretation of this prophecy, this localisation of the kingdom was much insisted on, and it was even thought that the Jewish law and the sacrificial worship would be revived. This of course is utterly incredible to most Christians: but there is no difficulty in supposing that the Kingdom of God may literally have an earthly centre in the Holy City and the Holy Land. Even if the literal view be not taken, the prophecy can hardly imply less than a future purity of the Church far exceeding the present; and it may be that this purified Church will recognise a better Papacy at Jerusalem, one not too proud to learn either from the excellences or from the faults of the Roman.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and fire came down</span> &c.] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm" title="And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.">2 Kings 1:10</a>, and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-5.htm" title="And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.">Revelation 11:5</a>, and even <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-13.htm" title="And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,">Revelation 13:13</a>. This does not agree with the description of Gog’s overthrow in Ezekiel 39, where the army lie slain till they are buried, and their weapons are broken up for firewood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from God</span>] Should probably be omitted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/revelation/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm" title="And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.">Revelation 20:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὴν πόλιν τὴν ἠγαπημένην</span>) Jerusalem is called <span class="greekheb">πόλις ἠγαπημένη</span>, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/24-11.htm" title="Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, and in Jerusalem was my power.">Sir 24:11</a>.

Either we must render <span class="accented">the camp</span>...  <span class="accented">even the beloved city</span>, or else we must understand the <span class="accented">camp</span> as a defensive outpost placed around or near the city. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-34.htm">Acts 21:34</a> the same word is rendered "castle." "The beloved city" is evidently Jerusalem (of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-68.htm">Psalm 78:68</a>), that is, the Church of God, of which it is always a type in the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>). The description plainly portrays the Church militant here on earth. <span class="cmt_word">And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</span>. "From God" is omitted in A, a few cursives, and Primasius, but appears in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, P, l, 7, and most cursives and versions; but these authorities vary in the position of the added clause. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>. fire devours the enemies of the two witnesses. This sentence is introduced in connection with the description of Gog and Magog, following the account of Ezekiel, where the same punishment is foretold (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-6.htm">Ezekiel 39:6</a>). It is probable, therefore, that nothing more definite is intended than to convey the general idea that God aids and protects his Church even while on earth. He, as it were, gives the enemies of his people a foretaste, while here on earth, of their future punishment of the lake of fire (see also on the seal visions). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>On the breadth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., over (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;).
