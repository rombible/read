The reign of Christ with His saints has been a witness to the power of our Master over the wicked one. This witness has been an opportunity also to the world. It was the earthly approximation to the ideal picture. It testified how completely “all power in heaven and in earth was given to Christ,” and how there lay, therefore, within the reach of men the power of Him who would tread down their true enemies, and turn His hand against their adversaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/81-13.htm" title="Oh that my people had listened to me, and Israel had walked in my ways!">Psalm 81:13-14</a>). But the time of opportunity must end. “O that Israel would have hearkened,” is a cry that might have its counterpart over the history of earth’s lost opportunities. Christendom is planted in the world to be a framework of regenerating power to mankind, just as the Law and its adjuncts were designed to be in Israel. But, as there the old idolatrous influences broke in upon the rule of God’s covenant, so here do we find the vision picturing to us how Christendom will be invaded by the influences of the evil one, when mankind has let slip this splendid opportunity of a really golden age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/revelation/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/20-7.htm" title="And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,...">Revelation 20:7-10</a></span>. The following verses of this chapter to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a> inform us that the happy days of the church, prophesied of in the foregoing vision, will at length have their period, though they are to continue for a long time, and are not to expire till after one thousand years: yet then there shall be one attempt more against the purity of religion, and against the peace and prosperity of the church. Satan will be released for a little season, but in that little season he shall deceive many, and so far seduce them as to prevail upon them to join with him in his apostacy. This new attempt against truth and righteousness shall end in the utter ruin of the enemies of Christ and his religion; they shall be totally defeated, and their obstinate wickedness punished with everlasting destruction. This state of the church and world, so different from the preceding, deserves to be considered as a new period, which will therefore be the fifth in order. — Lowman. <span class="ital">And when the thousand years are expired, </span>&c. — “At the expiration of the thousand years the restraint shall be taken off from wickedness; <span class="ital">Satan shall be loosed out of his prison </span>— And make one effort more to re-establish his kingdom. As he deceived our first parents in the paradisiacal state, so he shall have the artifice <span class="ital">to deceive the nations </span>in this millennium kingdom, to show that no state or condition on earth is exempted or secured from sinning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The nations whom he shall deceive are described as living in the remotest parts of the world; <span class="ital">in the four quarters </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εν ταις τεσσαρσι γωνιαις της γης</span>, <span class="ital">in the four angles, </span>or <span class="ital">corners, of the earth; </span>and they are distinguished by the name of Gog and Magog, and are said to be as numerous <span class="ital">as the sands of the sea. Gog and Magog </span>seem to have been formerly the general name of the northern nations of Europe and Asia, as <span class="ital">the Scythians </span>have been since, and <span class="ital">the Tartars </span>are at present. In Ezekiel there is a famous prophecy concerning <span class="ital">Gog and Magog, </span>and this prophecy alludes to that in many particulars. Both that of Ezekiel and this of St. John remain yet to be fulfilled; and therefore we cannot be absolutely certain that they may not both relate to the same event, but it appears more probable that they relate to different events. The one is expected to take place before, but the other will not take place till after, the millennium. <span class="ital">Gog and Magog, </span>in Ezekiel, are said expressly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm" title="Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with you.">Ezekiel 38:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm" title="And you shall come from your place out of the north parts, you, and many people with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company, and a mighty army:">Ezekiel 38:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm" title="And I will turn you back, and leave but the sixth part of you, and will cause you to come up from the north parts, and will bring you on the mountains of Israel:">Ezekiel 39:2</a>) to come from <span class="ital">the north quarters </span>and <span class="ital">the north parts; </span>but in St. John they came from <span class="ital">the four quarters, </span>or <span class="ital">corners, of the earth. Gog and Magog, </span>in Ezekiel, bend their forces against the Jews resettled in their own land; but in St. John they march up against <span class="ital">the saints </span>and church of God in general. It may therefore be concluded that <span class="ital">Gog and Magog, </span>as well as Sodom, and Egypt, and Babylon, are mystic names in this book; and the last enemies of the Christian Church are so denominated, because <span class="ital">Gog and Magog </span>appear to be the last enemies of the Jewish nation. Who they shall be, we cannot pretend to say with any degree of certainty: but whoever they shall be, they shall come up from <span class="ital">the four corners of the earth, on the breadth of the earth, </span>and shall <span class="ital">compass the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city</span> — The new Jerusalem, with the saints encamped around it, as the Israelites encamped around the tabernacle in the wilderness. But they shall not succeed in their attempts; they shall not be able to hurt the church and city of God, but shall be destroyed in an extraordinary manner, <span class="ital">by fire from heaven: </span>and <span class="ital">the devil </span>himself, the promoter and leader of this new apostacy and rebellion against God and his Christ, shall not only be confined as before, but shall be <span class="ital">cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where </span>he shall be punished together with <span class="ital">the beast and the false prophet, </span>who were cast in before him, <span class="ital">and shall be tormented for ever and ever.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:7-10 While this world lasts, Satan's power in it will not be wholly destroyed, though it may be limited and lessened. No sooner is Satan let loose, than he again begins deceiving the nations, and stirring them up to make war with the saints and servants of God. It would be well if the servants and ministers of Christ were as active and persevering in doing good, as his enemies in doing mischief. God will fight this last and decisive battle for his people, that the victory may be complete, and the glory be to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when the thousand years are expired - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>.<p>Satan shall be loosed out of his prison - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>. That is, a state of things will then occur as if Satan should be for a time let loose again, and should be permitted to go as formerly over the world. No intimation is given "why or how" he would be thus released from his prison. We are not, however, to infer that it would be a mere arbitrary act on the part of God. All that is necessary to be supposed is, that there would be, in certain parts of the world, a temporary outbreak of wickedness, as if Satan were for a time released from his chains. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/revelation/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. expired&#8212;Greek, "finished."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> When the long time expressed under the notion of a thousand years shall be expired, God shall take off his restraint from the devil, so as he shall influence the wicked of the earth once more to make opposition to his church. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/revelation/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the thousand years are expired,.... Which are not yet expired; not in the year 1000, or 1033 or 4, reckoning from the birth or death of Christ, when Paganism, which had been destroyed in the Gentile world, was introduced into the church, which bore the Christian name, through the man of sin; for this had been bringing in by degrees more or less from the times of Constantine; whence it appears, that Satan in this respect was loose before, and therefore this was not the time of his loosing; nor in 1073, reckoning from the destruction of Jerusalem, and the carrying and spread of the Gospel among the Gentiles, in which year Hildebrand came to the popedom, who may be truly called the brand of hell; Damianus, a brother cardinal, who lived at the same time with him when he was archdeacon of Rome, calls him the holy devil; he was an impostor, sorcerer, and necromancer, and by wicked arts got into the Papal chair; this pope raised the Papal power over princes to a very great height, and made the see of Rome absolutely independent, and all bishops dependent on it; he forbid bishops receiving their investiture from the emperor, or any lay person, under pain of excommunication: this is the pope that made the emperor, with his empress and child, wait three days barefoot at his gates, in the depth of winter, before they could be admitted to him; that doctrine of devils, forbidding priests to marry, was established by him; and in his days that monstrous and absurd notion of transubstantiation began to prevail, though he himself used his breaden god but very roughly; for taking it to be really God, he required an answer from it against the emperor; but it not speaking, he threw it into the fire, and burnt it. Now it will be allowed, that the devil was loose at this time, but then so he was before: there had been popes before this who were conjurers, necromancers, and had familiarity and confederacy with the devil; and near five hundred years before this time, the pope was declared universal bishop by Phocas; and the forbidding priests marriage was started in the council of Nice, and was approved of by Pope Siricius, long before this time, though it was now more firmly established; add to this, that if the expiration of the 1000 years and the loosing of Satan were at this time, he must have been loosed near 700 years, which can never be called a little season, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a> especially in comparison of the 1000 years, the time of his binding; when it is two thirds of that time: nor did these years expire in or about 1300, reckoning from Constantine, about which time Pope Boniface the Eighth lived, of whom it is said, that he came in like a fox, railed like a lion, and died like a dog; upon his accession to the popedom, he instituted a jubilee, and on the first day he appeared in his pontifical habit, and gave the benediction to the people, and on the next day he clothed himself with an imperial habit, and put on a rich diadem, and sat on a throne, with a naked sword bore before him, when he uttered these words, "Ecce hic duo gladii", "Behold here are two swords", referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-38.htm">Luke 22:38</a> which the Papists would have understood of the temporal and spiritual power which Peter and his successors are possessed of; at the same time Ottoman was crowned emperor of the Mahometan nations, who founded the Turkish empire, and spread the Mahometan religion in Asia and Greece; and by both these, great disturbances and wars were occasioned, both in the east and west: but still this does not make it appear that now was the time of Satan's loosing; since before this time the Papal power was at its utmost height, and the Mahometan religion had been hundreds of years in the world, and had greatly prevailed; and therefore Satan must be loosed before; and indeed it is in vain to seek after the expiration of these years, and the loosing of Satan, when as yet the years are not begun, nor has Satan been bound, as has been shown on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a> but however, when they will be ended, <p>Satan shall be loosed out of his prison; during the thousand years he will be in a state of confinement, being bound, shut, and sealed up in the bottomless pit, which is therefore here called a prison, as is the place of damned spirits, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a> but when these will be at an end; his chain will be taken off, at least will be lengthened; the seal upon him will be broken off, the bottomless pit will be opened, and he let loose; which will be done not by himself, but by him that bound him, or by divine permission. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/revelation/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> And when the <span class="cverse3">{15}</span> thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,</span><p>(14) The second history, of the latter victory of Christ, as was said in Re 20:1.

The difficulty that here the heathen nations once again enter into conflicts against the saints, after, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-21.htm" title="And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.">Revelation 19:21</a>, <span class="ital">all</span> nations and kings (rendering allegiance to the beast) have been annihilated,—to which also the other difficulty is added, that enemies to be found in the earthly life contend against believers who are partakers in the first resurrection,[4177]—is not explained fully by emphasizing[4178] the fact that these <span class="greekheb">ἔθνη</span>, Gog and Magog, dwell at the extreme ends of the earth. Vitr., Ewald, De Wette, etc., are indeed right when in harmony with the prototype, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/38-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:...">Ezekiel 38:3-9</a>,[4179] and the idea of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm" title="And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.">Revelation 20:9</a> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΈΒΗΣΑΝ ἘΠῚ ΤῸ ΠΛΆΤΟς Τῆς Γῆς</span></span></span>), they regard the farthest ends of the earth as the abode of these nations;[4180] but in the entire description of ch. 8. it was presupposed that all unbelieving inhabitants of the earth without exception, all kings and nations, had served the beast, and with him had perished. It is also to be acknowledged that the introduction of <span class="greekheb">ἔθνη</span> in this passage is a similar inconsistency as was previously shown in that the winds prepared at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a> for destruction do not afterwards come into activity; but this inconsistency—which is in general a material, and that, too, an inexplicable difficulty, only when the entire description, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/20-1.htm" title="And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand....">Revelation 20:1-10</a>, is regarded in all its individual parts as a prophecy to be thus actually fulfilled, instead of distinguishing the ideal character of the Apocalyptic mode of representation, and the actual contents of the prophecy to be determined from the analogy of the Holy Scriptures—is modified by the fact that the nations here presented, Gog and Magog, stand in no relation whatever to the beast, and dwell at such a distance that also, in this respect, they may appear with the dwellers on earth formerly found in the empire of the beast. For it is also in harmony with this, that these heathen nations are led to the conflict against the saints immediately by Satan himself.[4181]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν Γὼγ καὶ τὸν Μαγώγ</span>. Even in Jewish theology these two names occur, of which the first in Ezekiel, l. c., designates the king of the land and people of Magog[4182] as names of nations belonging together.[4183] Already, in Ezek., Magog appears, whose ethnographical determination,[4184] of course, nevertheless, lies in the background of the description[4185] as the representative and leader of the heathen nations in general, who rage against the people of God ruled by the Messiah, and are then destroyed by God. This prediction of Ezekiel was made use of already at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm" title="And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the middle of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God;">Revelation 19:17</a> sqq.;[4186] but only in this passage is it expressly interwoven in the description of the final catastrophe. Therefore the art. of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΠΌΛΕΜΟΝ</span></span></span> refers to the final attack to be made on the part of those heathen nations, as a conflict which is confessedly to be expected.[4187] [See Note LXXXIX., p. 473.] <span class="greekheb">ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸ πλάτος τὴς γὴς</span>. From the ends of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm" title="And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.">Revelation 20:8</a>) those nations come up to the broad plain of the earth,[4188] in order thus to reach the city in which the saints are encamped. The <span class="greekheb">ἀναβαίνειν</span>, which is a common expression for military expeditions,[4189] because the position of the attacked is naturally regarded as one that is to be found at an elevation,[4190] is here the more appropriate, because the going up of the nations is properly regarded against Jerusalem.[4191]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκύκλευσαν τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν ἁγίων καὶ τὴν πόλιν τὴν ἠγαπημένην</span>. The expression first of all distinguishes between the camp of the saints and the beloved city, i.e., Jerusalem, of course not in the sense wherein, e.g., Grot. understands by the camp, the seven churches, chs. 1–3, and by the beloved city, Constantinople; but the saints are to be regarded as gathered in the camp, in order to defend the holy city against the attacks of the heathen.[4192] The camp possibly surrounds the city, so that enemies at the same time enclose both.[4193] That the beloved city is the earthly Jerusalem,—not the new Jerusalem[4194] coming from heaven only at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a> sqq., after the judgment of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-15.htm" title="And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.">Revelation 20:15</a>),—is acknowledged with substantial unanimity; but it is an ordinary eluding of the context when Jerusalem is regarded as having the force only of a symbolical designation of the Church.[4195]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ κατέβη πῦρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

Theol. herausg. von Hilgenfeld</span>, 1862, p. 265 fl.) has in an exceedingly instructive way shown that Magog originally meant nothing but “dwelling-place, the land of Gog.” But the name of the people, Gog, means “mountain.” All etymological and geographical marks show that we are to recognize the actual people of Gog in the inhabitants of the Caucasus, as also the Greek <span class="greekheb">καυκάσιον οὖρος</span> in Herodotus really says nothing else than “the Asiatic Kauk (Gog), or the Asiatic high mountain” (p. 283).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4185] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm" title="And you shall come from your place out of the north parts, you, and many people with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company, and a mighty army:">Ezekiel 38:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4186] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-13.htm" title="And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.">Revelation 16:13</a> sqq.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4187] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-14.htm" title="For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.">Revelation 16:14</a> : <span class="greekheb">τὸν πολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκέιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4188] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm" title="For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.">Habakkuk 1:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4189] <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-4.htm" title="And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramothgilead?
