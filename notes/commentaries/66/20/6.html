The blessing on those who have part or share in the first resurrection has this definite feature. On these the second death has not power (or authority). The second death stands in contrast with the first resurrection. The second death is not the mere physical dying; it is rather that more awful death which lies outside the region of the things seen and temporal. Whatever it means, and whatever the conditions which surround it, it is spiritual rather than physical. It is not the life of the body which protects the life of the spirit; it is the living and believing in God which protects from the second death; according to Christ’s word of such, “they shall never die” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-26.htm" title="And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?">John 11:26</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:">John 10:27-28</a>). Blessed, too, are such in being priests and kings (they shall reign). Theirs is the priesthood of life who have offered themselves a living sacrifice to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>). The kingship of life is theirs, who have overcome the world-powers in the word of God and in the blood of the Lamb; these truly reign. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:4-6 Here is an account of the reign of the saints, for the same space of time as Satan is bound. Those who suffer with Christ, shall reign with him in his spiritual and heavenly kingdom, in conformity to him in his wisdom, righteousness, and holiness: this is called the first resurrection, with which none but those who serve Christ, and suffer for him, shall be favoured. The happiness of these servants of God is declared. None can be blessed but those that are holy; and all that are holy shall be blessed. We know something thing of what the first death is, and it is very awful; but we know not what this second death is. It must be much more dreadful; it is the death of the soul, eternal separation from God. May we never know what it is: those who have been made partakers of a spiritual resurrection, are saved from the power of the second death. We may expect that a thousand years will follow the destruction of the antichristian, idolatrous, persecuting powers, during which pure Christianity, in doctrine, worship, and holiness, will be made known over all the earth. By the all-powerful working of the Holy Spirit, fallen man will be new-created; and faith and holiness will as certainly prevail, as unbelief and unholiness now do. We may easily perceive what a variety of dreadful pains, diseases, and other calamities would cease, if all men were true and consistent Christians. All the evils of public and private contests would be ended, and happiness of every kind largely increased. Every man would try to lighten suffering, instead of adding to the sorrows around him. It is our duty to pray for the promised glorious days, and to do every thing in our public and private stations which can prepare for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/revelation/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed - That is, his condition is to be regarded as a happy or a favored one.

The ordinary meaning reduces the phrase to a hysteron proteron, unless the idea is that the bliss consists in holiness (so Vendidad xix. 22, “happy, happy the man who is holy with perfect holiness”). “Blessed and holy,” however, was a conventional Jewish term of praise and congratulation (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Jub. ii. 23).—<span class="greekheb">ὁ δεύτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θάνατος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. According to the Hellenic faith recorded in Plutarch (in his essay on “the face in the moon’s orb”), the second death, which gently severs the mind from the soul, is a boon, not a punishment. But John’s view reflects the tradition underlying the Iranian belief (Brandt, 586 f., 592) that the righteous were exempt from the second death (defined as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>). The clause <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> refers to the permanent standing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a><span class="ital"> a</span>) of these risen martyrs not only during but after the millennium; otherwise it would be meaningless, since the danger of the second death (as the penalty inflicted on all who are condemned at the final assizes) does not emerge until the millennium is over. The subsequent clause <span class="greekheb">καὶ βασιλεύσουσι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is independent, referring back to the special and temporary privilege of the first resurrection and the millennium. For this reason it is precarious to infer from <span class="greekheb">ἔσονται ἱερεῖς τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> (elsewhere <span class="greekheb">τῷ θεῷ</span>) that the occupation of these saints is the mediation of divine knowledge to the <span class="greekheb">ἔθνη</span> whom Satan is temporarily prevented from beguiling. The likelihood is that the phrase simply denotes as elsewhere the bliss of undisturbed access to God and of intimate fellowship. John ignores the current belief that the loyal survivors on earth would be rewarded (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-12.htm" title="Blessed is he that waits, and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.">Daniel 12:12</a>; Ps. Sol. 17:50, etc.), which is voiced in Asc. Isa. iv. 14–16, but he reproduces independently the cognate view (Asc. Isa. iv. 16 f.) that “the saints will come with the Lord with their garments which are (now) stored up on high in the seventh heaven [<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>] … they will descend and be present in this world” (after which the Beloved executes judgment at the resurrection). He, retains, however, not only the general resurrection (12) but the variant and earlier idea (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 4 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-26.htm" title="And whoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily on him, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.">Ezra 7:26</a> f.) of a resurrection (<span class="greekheb">ἔζησαν</span>, 4) confined to the saints. He calls this <span class="ital">the first resurrection</span> not because the martyrs and confessors who enjoyed it had to undergo a second in the process of their final redemption but because it preceded the only kind of resurrection with which sinners and even ordinary Christians had anything to do (Titius, 37–40; Baldensperger, 74, 79 f.).—<span class="greekheb">καὶ βασιλεύσουσι</span>, apparently on earth. This would be put beyond doubt were we to take the view of the risen martyrs’ occupation which has been set aside above. But, even apart from this, in the light of all relevant tradition and of the context, the earth must be the sphere of the millennium; Christ might of course be conceived to execute his sovereignty from heaven, but, though <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm" title="And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.">Revelation 20:9</a> denotes a different cycle of tradition from 4–6, it is put on the same plane, and the vision of 4 (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm" title="And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.">Revelation 20:1</a>) is evidently this world. <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span> would be more in keeping with this context than with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm" title="And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.">Revelation 20:10</a>, where again the refrain of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a> (<span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">β</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων</span>) would be more appropriate.—<span class="greekheb">χίλια ἔτη</span>. This enigmatic and isolated prediction has led to more unhappy fantasies of speculation and conduct than almost any other passage of the N.T. It stands severely apart from the sensuous expectations of current chiliasm (fertility of soil, longevity, a religious carnival, etc.), but even its earliest interpreters, Papias and Justin, failed to appreciate its reticence, its special object, and its semi-transcendent atmosphere. For its relevance, or rather irrelevance, to the normal Christian outlook, see Denney’s <span class="ital">Studies in Theology</span>, pp. 231 f., and A. Robertson’s <span class="ital">Regnum Dei</span>, pp. 113 f. When the millennium or messianic reign was thus abbreviated into a temporary phase of providence in the latter days, the resurrection had to be shifted from its original position prior to the messianic reign; it now became, as here, the sequel to that period.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Blessed and holy</span> &c.] He is sure of eternal blessedness, absolutely and indefeasibly consecrated to God. “Holy” refers to the relation to God into which this brings him, not to the foregoing faithfulness that is implied in his being admitted into it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the second death</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.">Revelation 2:11</a>, and <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm" title="And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.

We may in this place briefly indicate some of the other interpretations which have been given to this reign cf. the saints for a thousand years, or, as it is generally styled, the millennium. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The literal interpretation of a future reign on earth of Christ with his saints for a thousand years. According to this view, there is to be a first resurrection of the dead (either of the holy dead or of all the dead), then the period of a thousand years, during which Satan will be bound, and the saints will reign; then finally the ultimate punishment of Satan - the casting into the lake of fire. Some limit the locality of this reign to a particular spot on the earth (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jerusalem), beyond which live the ungodly. The objections to this theory are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Amongst its advocates almost every detail is a matter of dispute. Some place the millennium in the future, others in the past. Of these latter some specify the first thousand years of the Christian age, others the thousand years from the time of Constantine. "The length of the period, the number and class of the believers who shall be partakers of its glory, the condition in which they are to live, the work in which they are to be engaged, the relation in which the exalted Redeemer is to stand to them," are all subjects for disagreement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The carnal nature of such a resurrection is at variance with the general teaching of the Bible, and unlike the spiritual nature which our Lord himself assumed after his resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> If the saints receive a glorified body for that period, it is impossible to conceive of them as living in the world in its present state, and a large part of which is inhabited by the ungodly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> It is impossible satisfactorily to conceive what relations could exist between the saints in such a case and the ungodly. If Satan is bound during this period so that he can deceive the nations no more, whence comes the evil which exists among the ungodly portion of the world? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> There is no other example of a literal use of numbers in the whole of the Apocalypse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(f)</span> The teaching of the Bible elsewhere not only negatively fails to support this view, but is in positive opposition to it, in such points as a continuance of evil after Christ's second coming; the existence of an interval between his coming and the judgment instead of a sudden coming to judgment (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>, "I will raise him up at the last day"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The spiritual interpretation, which makes the thousand years expressive of the whole Christian age. This seems to a certain extent true, since what the thousand years signifies does have its effect during this time in the reign of the saints. But it seems inexact, since it makes the thousand years symbolical of a length of time, instead of a quality attached to an action. What is meant is not that Christ bound Satan during the period of the Christian age (though, as we have seen, there is a sense in which he is so bound as regards believers), for, on the contrary, he goes about like a roaring lion; but that he bound and overthrew him completely for all Christians by his redeeming work. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/revelation/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hath part (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>A phrase peculiar to John as referring to a person.
