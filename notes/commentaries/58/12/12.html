Faith and patience enable believers to follow peace and holiness, as a man follows his calling constantly, diligently, and with pleasure. Peace with men, of all sects and parties, will be favourable to our pursuit of holiness. But peace and holiness go together; there can be not right peace without holiness. Where persons fail of having the true grace of God, corruption will prevail and break forth; beware lest any unmortified lust in the heart, which seems to be dead, should spring up, to trouble and disturb the whole body. Falling away from Christ is the fruit of preferring the delights of the flesh, to the blessing of God, and the heavenly inheritance, as Esau did. But sinners will not always have such mean thoughts of the Divine blessing and inheritance as they now have. It agrees with the profane man's disposition, to desire the blessing, yet to despise the means whereby the blessing is to be gained. But God will neither sever the means from the blessing, nor join the blessing with the satisfying of man's lusts. God's mercy and blessing were never sought carefully and not obtained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - In view of the facts which have been now stated - that afflictions are sent from God, and are evidences of his paternal watchfulness.<p>Lift up the hands which hang down - As if from weariness and exhaustion. Renew your courage; make a new effort to bear them. The hands fall by the side when we are exhausted with toil, or worn down by disease; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-3.htm">Isaiah 35:3</a>, from which place this exhortation is taken.<p>And the feeble knees - The knees also become enfeebled by long effort, and tremble as if their strength were gone. Courage and resolution may do much, however, to make them firm, and it is to this that the apostle exhorts those to whom he wrote. They were to make every effort to bear up under their trials. The hope of victory will do much to strengthen one almost exhausted in battle; the desire to reach home invigorates the frame of the weary traveler. So it is with the Christian. In persecution, and sickness, and bereavement, he may be ready to sink under his burdens. The hands fall, and the knees tremble, and the heart sinks within us. But confidence in God, and the hope of heaven, and the assurance that all this is for our good, will reinvigorate the enfeebled frame, and enable us to bear what we once supposed would crush us to the dust. A courageous mind braces a feeble body, and hope makes it fresh for new conflicts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. He addresses them as runners in a race, and pugilists, and warriors [Chrysostom]. The "wherefore" is resumed from Heb 12:1.<p>lift up&#8212;In Isa 35:3, from which Paul here quotes, it is, "Strengthen ye the weak hands." The hand is the symbol of one's strength. Alford translates, "Put straight again the relaxed hands." English Version expresses the sense well.<p>feeble&#8212;literally, "paralyzed"; a word used only by Luke, Paul's companion, in the New Testament. The exhortation has three parts: the first relates to ourselves, Heb 12:12, 13; the second, to others, Heb 12:14, "peace with all men"; the third, to God, "holiness, without which," &c. The first is referred to in Heb 12:15, "test any man fail of the grace of God"; the second in the words, "lest any root of bitterness," &c.; the third in Heb 12:16, "Lest there be any fornicator or profane person," &c. This threefold relation often occurs in Paul's Epistles. Compare Note, see on [2596]Tit 2:12, "soberly, righteously, and godly." The Greek active verb, not the middle or reflexive, requires the sense to be, Lift up not only your own hands and knees, but also those of your brethren (compare Heb 12:15; Isa 35:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This introduceth the use of the doctrine of God’s chastening providences, stated before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Wherefore</span> concludes the rationality and necessity of the duty subjoined, as consequent from the truth asserted before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lift up; </span> anorywsate notes the making, or setting aright, that which was out of its proper place and posture, as disordered members into their right frame and composure, that there be not any let in our Christian race, nor fainting by our course in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; </span> by hanging down hands, and palsied knees, are metaphorically represented the hearts, spirits, and souls of these children, such as droop, despond, and are ready to faint and die away under chastening, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/35-3.htm" title="Strengthen you the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees....">Isaiah 35:3-6</a></span>.

So here, the hands hang down in listless consciousness of defeat. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τροχιὰς ὀρθὰς</span> … “and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way but rather be healed”. The words are quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm" title="Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.">Proverbs 4:26</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὀρθὰς τροχιὰς ποίει σοῖς ποσί</span>, and if <span class="greekheb">ποιήσατε</span> is retained they form a hexameter line. The whole verse forms an admonition to the healthier portion of the church to make no deviation from the straight course set before them by the example of Christ, and thus they would offer no temptation to the weaker members [<span class="greekheb">τὸ χωλὸν</span>, the lame and limping] to be turned quite out of the way, but would rather be an encouragement to them and so afford them an opportunity of being healed of their infirmity. [A number of interpreters take <span class="greekheb">ἐκτραπῇ</span> in the sense of “dislocated”. Thus Davidson, “The words ‘turned out of the way’ mean in medical writers ‘dislocated,’ and this gives a more vigorous sense and forms a better opposition to ‘be healed’. Inconsistency and vacillation in the general body of the church would create a way so difficult for the lame, that their lameness would become dislocation, and they would perish from the way; on the other hand, the habit of going in a plain path would restore them to soundness.” This is inviting, but there is much against it. (1) The medical use of <span class="greekheb">ἐκτρέπομαι</span> is rare (see Stephanus) and not likely to occur here. (2) When used in a general sense <span class="greekheb">ἰαθῇ</span> is an appropriate antithesis; thus in Niceph. Call. (see Stephanus) occur the words <span class="greekheb">Ἰωάννῃ τῷ Ἱεροσολύμων πατριάρχῃ τὴν ἀκοὴν ἐκτραπεῖσαν ἰᾶται</span>. (3) The passage in Proverbs from which the former part of the verse is cited goes on thus: “Turn not aside to the right hand nor to the left”.] Immediately after these words follows a clause which guides to the interpretation of <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνην διώκετε μετὰ πάντων</span>, “God will make thy ways straight and will guide thy goings in peace”; and a considerable part of the counsels given in the context in Proverbs concerns the maintenance of peaceful relations with others. The circumstances of the Hebrews were fitted to excite a quarrelsome spirit, and a feeling of alienation towards those weak members who left the straight path. They must not suffer them to be alienated but must restore them to the unity of the faith, and in endeavouring to reclaim them must use the methods of peace not of anger or disputation. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸν ἁγιασμόν</span> … “and the consecration without which no one shall see the Lord”. The <span class="greekheb">ἁγιασμός</span> which this Epistle has explained is a drawing near to God with cleansed conscience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>), a true acceptance of Christ’s sacrifice as bringing the worshipper into fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore</span>] The poetic style, and even the metrical form of diction in these two verses (of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-13.htm" title="And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.">Hebrews 12:13</a> contains a complete hexameter,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τροχιὰς ὀρθὰς ποιήσατε τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>and half an iambic,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ τὸ χωλὸν ἐκτραπῇ</span>),<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>reflect the earnestness of the writer, as he gives more and more elaboration to his sentences in approaching the climax of his appeal.
