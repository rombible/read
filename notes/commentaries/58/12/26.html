They may, however, look forward even to Christ’s second coming, and the final consummation of all things. For <span class="ital">this word, Yet once more </span>— Or once for all, not only <span class="ital">signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken </span>— The total subversion of the Jewish commonwealth and church, with the ordinances of Moses; <span class="ital">as of things that are made </span>— Namely, by human hands; or constituted or appointed only for a time; (the verb <span class="greekheb">ποιειν</span>, here used, frequently meaning <span class="ital">to constitute </span>or <span class="ital">appoint, </span>as chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-14.htm" title="And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,">Mark 3:14</a>, in both which passages it is translated <span class="ital">to appoint, </span>as it is also in many other places;) <span class="ital">that those things which cannot be shaken </span>— A dispensation to be changed no more; <span class="ital">may remain </span>— Fixed on a perpetual basis; even that eternal kingdom of righteousness and peace which God hath established by his Son Jesus Christ. This inference the apostle rightly draws from the expression, <span class="ital">yet once more. </span>For, as it implies that God would make but one alteration more in the religious worship of the world, it certainly follows that the form to be substituted in the room of the things to be shaken or removed, shall be permanent. The gospel, therefore, will remain to the end of the world, as the only form of religion acceptable to God. And then, as the words also imply, the heaven and the earth shall themselves be removed, as things made and intended only to endure for a time; and those things which cannot be shaken, the new heaven and the new earth, shall remain, to be the inheritance of God’s people for ever, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a>, &c.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:18-29 Mount Sinai, on which the Jewish church state was formed, was a mount such as might be touched, though forbidden to be so, a place that could be felt; so the Mosaic dispensation was much in outward and earthly things. The gospel state is kind and condescending, suited to our weak frame. Under the gospel all may come with boldness to God's presence. But the most holy must despair, if judged by the holy law given from Sinai, without a Saviour. The gospel church is called Mount Zion; there believers have clearer views of heaven, and more heavenly tempers of soul. All the children of God are heirs, and every one has the privileges of the first-born. Let a soul be supposed to join that glorious assembly and church above, that is yet unacquainted with God, still carnally-minded, loving this present world and state of things, looking back to it with a lingering eye, full of pride and guile, filled with lusts; such a soul would seem to have mistaken its way, place, state, and company. It would be uneasy to itself and all about it. Christ is the Mediator of this new covenant, between God and man, to bring them together in this covenant; to keep them together; to plead with God for us, and to plead with us for God; and at length to bring God and his people together in heaven. This covenant is made firm by the blood of Christ sprinkled upon our consciences, as the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled upon the altar and the victim. This blood of Christ speaks in behalf of sinners; it pleads not for vengeance, but for mercy. See then that you refuse not his gracious call and offered salvation. See that you do not refuse Him who speaketh from heaven, with infinite tenderness and love; for how can those escape, who turn from God in unbelief or apostacy, while he so graciously beseeches them to be reconciled, and to receive his everlasting favour! God's dealing with men under the gospel, in a way of grace, assures us, that he will deal with the despisers of the gospel, in a way of judgment. We cannot worship God acceptably, unless we worship him with reverence and godly fear. Only the grace of God enables us to worship God aright. God is the same just and righteous God under the gospel as under the law. The inheritance of believers is secured to them; and all things pertaining to salvation are freely given in answer to prayer. Let us seek for grace, that we may serve God with reverence and godly fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whose voice then shook the earth - When he spake at Mount Sinai. The meaning is, that the mountain and the region around quaked; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>. The "voice" here referred to is that of God speaking from the holy mount.<p>But now hath he promised, saying - The words here quoted are taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>, where they refer to the changes which would take place under the Messiah. The meaning is, that there would be great revolutions in his coming, "as if" the universe were shaken to its center. The apostle evidently applies this passage as it is done in Haggai, to the first advent of the Redeemer.<p>I shake not the earth only - This is not quoted literally from the Hebrew, but the sense is retained. In Haggai it is, "Yet once it is a little while, and I wilt shake the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come." The apostle lays emphasis on the fact that not only the earth was to be shaken but also heaven. The shaking of the earth here evidently refers to the commotions among the nations that would prepare the way for the coming of the Messiah.<p>But also heaven - This may refer either:<p>(1) to the extraordinary phenomena in the heavens at the birth, the death, and the ascension of Christ; or.<p>(2) to the revolutions in morals and religion which would be caused by the introduction of the gospel, as if everything were to be changed - expressed by "a shaking of the heavens and the earth;" or.<p>(3) it may be more literally taken as denoting that there was a remarkable agitation in the heavens - in the bosoms of its inhabitants - arising from a fact so wonderful as that the Son of God should descend to earth, suffer, and die.<p>I see no reason to doubt that the latter idea may have been included here; and the meaning of the whole then is, that while the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, fearful and solemn as it was, was an event that merely shook the earth in the vicinity of the holy Mount, the introduction of the gospel agitated the universe. Great changes upon the earth were to precede it; one revolution was to succeed another preparatory to it, and the whole universe would be moved at an event so extraordinary. The meaning is, that the introduction of the gospel was a much more solemn and momentous thing than the giving of the Law - and that, therefore, it was much more fearful and dangerous to apostatize from it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. then shook&#8212;when He gave the law on Sinai.<p>now&#8212;under the Gospel.<p>promised&#8212;The announcement of His coming to break up the present order of things, is to the ungodly a terror, to the godly a promise, the fulfilment of which they look for with joyful hope.<p>Yet once more&#8212;Compare Notes, see on [2599]Hag 2:6; [2600]Hag 2:21, 22, both of which passages are condensed into one here. The shaking began at the first coming of Messiah; it will be completed at His second coming, prodigies in the world of nature accompanying the overthrow of all kingdoms that oppose Messiah. The Hebrew is literally, "it is yet one little," that is, a single brief space till the series of movements begins ending in the advent of Messiah. Not merely the earth, as at the establishment of the Sinaitic covenant, but heaven also is to be shaken. The two advents of Messiah are regarded as one, the complete shaking belonging to the second advent, of which the presage was given in the shakings at the first advent: the convulsions connected with the overthrow of Jerusalem shadowing forth those about to be at the overthrow of all the God-opposed kingdoms by the coming Messiah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whose voice then shook the earth:</span> the sin and punishment of gospel despisers and rejecters, is aggravated by the Person concerned in both.

The apostle brings the two verses into one, by which he shows that it was one and the same shaking, of which the one verse of Haggai denotes the beginning, the other the end.

Again, ver. 21, "I will shake the heavens and the earth" (cf. lea. 2:19, 21). The prophecy was uttered with reference to the second temple, the glory of which was to be greater than the glory of the first, in that it should be the scene of the LORD'S final revelation of himself to his people. Its first fulfillment is rightly seen in Christ's first coming (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>, "And in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple"). But the language used points evidently, even in itself, to a further fulfillment; nor do readers need to be reminded here of the pregnant and far-reaching sense of all Messianic prophecy. "Illustre est testimonium Psalm Newtoni ad Dan. p. 91: <span class="accented">vixque in omni V.T. aliquod de Christo extat vaticinium</span>, <span class="accented">quod non</span>, <span class="accented">aliquatenus saltem</span>, <span class="accented">secundum ejus ad-ventum respiciat"</span> (Bengel). The ultimate reference is what is seen dimly afar off in so many of the prophetic visions - the final dissolution of the whole present order of things, to be succeeded by the kingdom of eternal righteousness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>, etc.). By the heaven that is to be shaken in that great day is meant, of course, not the eternal abode of God, but that which is created and visible (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 27). This final shaking is set against the local and typical shaking of Mount Sinai in two points of contrast - its extending to the whole creation, and its being once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>); and from the latter expression the removing of the things thus finally shaken is in the next verse inferred. This inference, though not following necessarily from the expression itself, is involved in the general drift of Haggai's prophecy, taken in connection with other cognate ones, in which an entirely new and heavenly order is pictured as rising over the ruins of the old (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>, referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7, 10, 13</a>, "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Whose voice (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;)<p>Connect, after the parenthesis, with speaketh better, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>.<p>Shook (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/21-26.htm">Luke 21:26</a>, and comp. &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; tossing or swell of the sea, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>.

The quotation is adapted from lxx, which reads: "Yet once will I shake the heaven and the earth and the sea and the dry land." The Hebrew for "yet once" reads "yet a little while." In Haggai's prophecy, he comforts the people for their sorrow that the second temple is so inferior to the first, predicting that Jehovah will move heaven and earth and sea and land, and will fill the house with his glory; and the glory of the latter house shall exceed that of the former. The discipline begun on Sinai will then have its consummation. This shaking of heaven and earth was typified by the material shaking at Sinai. The shaking predicted by the prophet is applied by our writer to the downfall of worldly powers before the kingdom of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>; comp <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>, and see <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14.htm">Zechariah 14</a>. </body></html>
