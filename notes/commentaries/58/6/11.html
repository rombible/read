Hope has its degrees, as faith also. The promise of blessedness God has made to believers, is from God's eternal purpose, settled between the eternal Father, Son, and Spirit. These promises of God may safely be depended upon; for here we have two things which cannot change, the counsel and the oath of God, in which it is not possible for God to lie; it would be contrary to his nature as well as to his will. And as He cannot lie; the destruction of the unbeliever, and the salvation of the believer, are alike certain. Here observe, those to whom God has given full security of happiness, have a title to the promises by inheritance. The consolations of God are strong enough to support his people under their heaviest trials. Here is a refuge for all sinners who flee to the mercy of God, through the redemption of Christ, according to the covenant of grace, laying aside all other confidences. We are in this world as a ship at sea, tossed up and down, and in danger of being cast away. We need an anchor to keep us sure and steady. Gospel hope is our anchor in the storms of this world. It is sure and stedfast, or it could not keep us so. The free grace of God, the merits and mediation of Christ, and the powerful influences of his Spirit, are the grounds of this hope, and so it is a stedfast hope. Christ is the object and ground of the believer's hope. Let us therefore set our affections on things above, and wait patiently for his appearance, when we shall certainly appear with him in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And we desire that every one of you - We wish that every member of the church should exhibit the same endeavor to do good until they attain to the full assurance of hope. It is implied here that the full assurance of hope is to be obtained by a persevering effort to lead a holy life.<p>The same diligence - The same strenuous endeavor, the same ardor and zeal.<p>To the full assurance of hope - In order to obtain the full assurance of hope. The word rendered "full assurance," means firm persuasion, and refers to a state of mind where there is the fullest conviction, or where there is no doubt; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-5.htm">Romans 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>, where the same word, in different forms, occurs. Hope is a compound emotion (see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>), made up of an earnest "desire" for an object, and a corresponding "expectation" of obtaining it. The hope of heaven is made up of an earnest "wish" to reach heaven, and a corresponding "expectation" of it, or "reason to believe" that it will be ours. The full assurance of that hope exists where there is the highest desire of heaven, and such corresponding evidence of personal piety as to leave no doubt that it will be ours.<p>To the end - To the end of life. The apostle wished that they would persevere in such acts of piety to the end of their course, as to have their hope of heaven fully established, and to leave no doubt on the mind that they were sincere Christians. Hence, learn:<p>(1) that full assurance of hope is to be obtained only by holy living.<p>(2) it is only when that is persevered in that it can be obtained.<p>(3) it is not by visions and raptures; by dreams and revelations that it can now be acquired, for God imparts no such direct revelation now.<p>(4) it is usually only as the result of a life of consistent piety that such an assurance is to be obtained. No man can have it who does not persevere in holy living, and they who do obtain it usually secure it only near the end of a life of eminent devotedness to God.<p>God could impart it at once when the soul is converted, but such is the tendency of man to indolence and sloth that even good people would then relax their efforts, and sit down contented, feeling that they had now the undoubted prospect of heaven. As it is, it is held out as a prize to be won - as that whose acquisition is to cheer us in our old age, when the warfare is over, and when amidst the infirmities of years, and the near prospect of death, we need special consolation; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6-7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

In the constant exercise of the graces of faith and love, and in ministering to the necessities of the saints: there is a spiritual labour, diligence, and industry to be used by the saints; and former diligence is a motive to future; and is a means of attaining to full assurance, as appears by what follows; and this is to be shown for the glory of God, for the evidence of the above graces, and for an example and encouragement to other saints: and the persons addressed being "everyone", this shows the apostle's impartiality in his exhortations, and served to remove all groundless suspicions in particular persons; and the manner of his addressing them shows his hearty concern for their welfare, his mildness and gentleness towards them, and his design to encourage them to go forward; and that his exhortation might have the greater weight, he uses the plural "we"; and this exhortation, put in this form, moreover shows that what he had said before had no tendency in some things to encourage despair, or in others carelessness and indolence: and what he had in view in the whole was, that they might arrive <p>to the full assurance of hope unto the end; not only that they might keep up an hope, but attain to the full assurance of it; as to interest in the love and grace of God; in the covenant of grace, its blessings and promises; in God, as a covenant God and Father; in Christ, as a Saviour and Redeemer; and as to the truth of the work of grace upon their souls, and their right and meetness for the possession of eternal glory and happiness: the phrase, "unto the end", may either respect the continuance of the grace of assurance; or refer to the showing forth of their diligence and industry in ministering to the saints, as they had done, to the end of their lives. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-11.htm" title="And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:...">Hebrews 6:11-12</a>.

There is denoted by it, on the one hand, that the heart-felt interest which the author cherishes in the readers extends to every single one of them. On the other hand, there lies in it the thought that if haply single individuals among the readers already correspond to the demand here made, it is still of supreme importance that every one of them should so comport himself as is mentioned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the sequel, <span class="greekheb">τὴν αὐτὴν ἐνδείκνυσθαι σπουδήν</span> is not in such manner to be taken together with <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τέλους</span> that the main stress should fall upon this, and <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν πληροφορίαν τῆς ἐλπίδος</span> be regarded as a mere subsidiary factor. In connection with this mode of interpretation, adopted by Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Grotius, Seb. Schmidt, Limborch, and others, the demand of the author would amount to this, that the readers should manifest the same zeal which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-10.htm" title="For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.">Hebrews 6:10</a>, they have already displayed, even to the end or in all future time. But in such manner it is assumed that the author has every reason for being satisfied with the Christian condition of the readers, and desires nothing more than a continuance of the same, whereas the whole epistle testifies that the state of things with the Hebrews was very different from this. Hence it is evident that the emphasis rests quite as much upon <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν πληροφορίαν τῆς ἐλπίδος</span> as upon <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τέλους</span>. The thought must thus be: the author longs for the readers to display the same zeal which they have already manifested in regard to an active love, in equal measure also in another relation, namely, in regard to the <span class="greekheb">πληροφορία κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. (so Bengel, Cramer, Chr. Fr. Schmid, Böhme, Stuart, Bleek, Ebrard, Delitzsch, Alford, Conybeare, Maier, Moll, Kurtz, and others), in connection with which, however, <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τέλους</span> is best taken, not, as is generally the case even with this correct determination of the thought, with <span class="greekheb">ἐνδείκνυσθαι</span>, but in close juxtaposition with <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν πληροφορίαν τῆς ἐλπίδος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν πληροφορίαν τῆς ἐλπίδος ἄχρι τέλους</span>] <span class="ital">in regard to the full certainty of conviction concerning the Christian’s hope, unto the end, i.e.</span> in such manner that ye cherish and preserve to the end the Christian’s hope of the Messianic kingdom to be looked for at the coming again of Christ, as a firm confidence of faith, untroubled by any doubts.
