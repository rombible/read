Moses was “in God’s house;” however exalted his position, he was in the house as a servant. The Greek word used here does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, but is taken from the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>. There is nothing special in the Hebrew word in that place, but the translators seem to have felt that “bond-servant” was less suitable in such a context than “attendant” or “minister.” The object of his service was that he might bear “testimony of the things that should hereafter be spoken.” Are we to understand by these the divine commands that would from time to time be given to Moses? If so, then the statement “Moses was faithful” must be regarded as a pure quotation, equivalent to “Moses was at that time declared faithful.” This does not seem probable. If, however, the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a> are taken as descriptive of the whole life of Moses, his “witness” must relate to the things spoken “in these last days;” of these, by his writings, his acts, his life, Moses bore constant witness. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-26.htm" title="Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.">Hebrews 11:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-46.htm" title="For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.">John 5:46</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) The latter interpretation is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>, in which the name given to our Lord is not Jesus, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>, but <span class= "ital">Christ.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;...">Hebrews 3:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Moses verily </span>— Another proof of the pre-eminence of Christ above Moses; <span class="ital">was faithful in all his house as a servant </span>— <span class="greekheb">Θεραπων</span>, <span class="ital">minister, </span>or <span class="ital">officer. </span>In describing the faithfulness of Moses, when, under God, he built the Jewish Church, God called him, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>,) <span class="ital">My servant Moses. </span>From this the apostle justly inferred that Moses was not a legislator, but only a messenger from the legislator, or his minister. This was his place, this his dignity and honour; and it was amplified by the considerations, that he was <span class="ital">faithful </span>in his service — was a servant in <span class="ital">the house of God </span>— and was not thus employed, and thus faithful, in this or that part, this or that service of God’s house, but in <span class="ital">his whole house, </span>and all the concernments of it. Herein was he different from all others in the same service in the Old Testament; one was employed in one part of it, another in another; one to instruct, another to reform it, one to renew a neglected ordinance, another to give new instructions; no one but he was used in the service of the whole house. <span class="ital">For a testimony of the things, </span>&c. — That is, because the Jewish Church was designed for a testimony of the things which were afterward to be spoken by Christ and his apostles. This shows that Moses’s faithfulness consisted not only in forming the tabernacle and its services, according to the pattern showed him by God, but in recording all the preceding revelations, exactly as they were discovered to him by the Spirit. For these revelations, equally with the types and figures of the Levitical ritual, were intended to exhibit the things afterward to be spoken by Christ. Hence our Lord said to the Jews, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-46.htm" title="For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.">John 5:46</a>,) <span class="ital">Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me; </span>namely, in the figures, but especially in the prophecies of his law, where the gospel dispensation, the coming of its author, and his character as Messiah, are all described with a precision which adds the greatest lustre of evidence to Jesus and his gospel. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a>. <span class="ital">But Christ as a Son — </span>That is, was faithful as a Son; <span class="ital">over his own house — </span>“Every word proves the asserted pre-eminence of Christ; <span class="ital">he is a Son, </span>Moses <span class="ital">a servant; </span>he <span class="ital">over </span>the house, Moses <span class="ital">in </span>the house; he over <span class="ital">his own house, </span>Moses in the house of <span class="ital">another. </span>The argument of the apostle therefore is obvious.” — Owen. But Pierce objects to this version, <span class="ital">over his own house, </span>and thinks the reading ought to be <span class="ital">his, </span>that is, God’s <span class="ital">house; </span>“1st, Because if the church be Christ’s own house, to speak of him as a <span class="ital">Song of Solomon </span>was improper, by reason that he would have presided over it as its <span class="ital">master. </span>2d, Because the apostle’s argument requires that Christ be faithful to the same person as a Son, to whom Moses was faithful as a servant.” Wherefore <span class="ital">his house, </span>he thinks, in this verse, is God’s house or church. Inasmuch, however, as Christ is the <span class="ital">heir of all things, </span>it may with the utmost propriety be said that the church is <span class="ital">his own house, </span>that is, the house in which he hath not only a trust and office, but also a property; which is appointed for him to inhabit and preside over, and which is still more especially his own, as it was purchased with his own blood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>. <span class="ital">Whose house we </span>— All true believers; <span class="ital">are </span>— Or shall make it appear that we are, namely, lively stones in the spiritual temple built upon him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a>; and inhabited by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;...">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; and true members of his family, his servants, yea, even his brethren and sisters; <span class="ital">if we hold fast the confidence </span>— <span class="greekheb">Την παρρησιαν</span>, properly, <span class="ital">the liberty of speech; </span>that is, that bold profession of the Christian faith which in the first age was so dangerous, exposing those who made it frequently to imprisonment and martyrdom, but which was absolutely necessary to the continuance of the gospel in the world; and therefore it was expressly required by Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-32.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven....">Matthew 10:32-33</a>.

The apostle uses another word, namely, <span class="greekheb">υποστασις</span>, to express confidence, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a>. <span class="ital">And the rejoicing </span>— Or, <span class="ital">glorying, </span>as <span class="greekheb">καυχημα </span>signifies; <span class="ital">of hope </span>— Hope of eternal life founded on God’s promises, namely, the hope which we professed at our baptism; <span class="ital">firm </span>— Without declining from or being shaken in it; keeping it up against all that fluctuating uncertainty of mind, which is apt to invade and possess unstable persons; <span class="ital">unto the end </span>— That is, as long as we live; not for the present season only, but in all future occurrences until we come to the end of our faith, the final salvation of our souls. Now, in order to this, great care and watchfulness, zeal, diligence, and resolution must be exercised, because of the opposition and violence that will be used to wrest them from us. Hence the exhortation contained in the following paragraph.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, the Messenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which we profess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ, the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest. As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls. Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and serious thoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a high opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but a type of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church, his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant; Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and Sovereign Ruler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in the ways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end. Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest more wisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moses was faithful ...as a servant - Not as the head of the dispensation; not as having originated it; but as in the employ and under the direction of its great Founder and Author - the Messiah. As such a servant he deserves all the honor for fidelity which has ever been claimed for him, but it cannot be the honor which is due to him who is at the head of the family or house. Paul "assumed" that Moses was a "servant," and argued on that supposition, without attempting to prove it, because it was so often affirmed in the Old Testament, and must have been conceded by all the Jews. In numerous instances he is spoken of as "the servant of the Lord;" see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-24.htm">Joshua 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-49.htm">1 Chronicles 6:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-9.htm">2 Chronicles 24:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-29.htm">Nehemiah 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-26.htm">Psalm 105:26</a>. As this point was undisputed, it was only necessary to show that the Messiah was superior to a "servant," in order to make the argument clear.<p>For a testimony - To bear witness to those truths which were to be revealed; that is, he was the instrument of the divine communications to the people, or the medium by which God made his will known. He did not originate the truths himself; but he was the mere medium by which God made known his truth to his people - a servant whom He employed to make his will known. The word after here is not necessary in order to a just translation of this passage, and obscures the sense. It does not mean that he was a witness of those truths which were to be spoken "subsequently" to his time under another dispensation, nor those truths which the apostle proposed to consider in another part of the Epistle, as Doddridge supposes; but it means merely that Moses stood forth as a public witness of the truths which God designed to reveal, or which were to be spoken. God did not speak to his people "directly," and face to face, but he spoke through Moses as an organ, or medium. The sense is, Moses was a mere servant of God to communicate his will to man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. faithful in all his house&#8212;that is in all God's house (Heb 3:4).<p>servant&#8212;not here the Greek for "slave," but "a ministering attendant"; marking the high office of Moses towards God, though inferior to Christ, a kind of steward.<p>for a testimony of, &c.&#8212;in order that he might in his typical institutions give "testimony" to Israel "of the things" of the Gospel "which were to be spoken afterwards" by Christ (Heb 8:5; 9:8, 23; 10:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The gospel Minister doth not only excel Moses as much as a builder doth his work, but as a son doth a servant, proved in this and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant; </span> your great legal prophet, in whom many of you Hebrews trust, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a></span>, did truly and fully reveal and do what God charged him, in ministering his will to his church, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/40-16.htm" title="Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he....">Exodus 40:16-33</a></span>; he did not diminish from, nor add the least to, God’s charge, yerapwn, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a></span>.

Moses was not only a servant to the Israelites, but he was also the Lord's servant, a servant of his choosing, sending, and approving; he was a servant in holy things, and served the Lord heartily, sincerely, and ingenuously, with all becoming fear and reverence, respect, and honour, and with all ready and cheerful obedience; the house in which he was a servant, was not his own, but belonged to God, even the Son of God, as appears from the following verse; he was not a servant in the world, and with respect to civil things, and the affairs of Providence, but in the church of God, and in divine things; and he was faithful here, and that in all things; he did all things exactly according to the pattern showed him in the Mount; and the apostle strongly affirms all this, as well he might, since there was full proof of it, and God himself had bore a testimony to it: and the end of his being a servant here was, <p>for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; these words may regard his faithful testification of God's will to the people of Israel, after he was fixed as a servant in God's house; or what he said afterwards concerning the Messiah, of whom he spake and wrote, and of whom he bore an honourable testimony, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a> or they may have respect to the things spoken after Moses's time, by the prophets, Christ, and his apostles, which agreed with the testimony of Moses; or to the things afterwards spoken of in this epistle; to which may be added, that Moses in his office was typical of things to be spoken and done by the Messiah, when he came; as his deliverance of the children of Israel out of Egypt; his leading them through the Red sea and wilderness, to Canaan's land; his giving them the law from Mount Sinai; the erection of the tabernacle, with all its furniture, and the institution of sacrifices and the like. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Moses verily <i>was</i> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</span><p>(5) Another comparison: Moses was a faithful servant in this house, that is, in the Church, serving the Lord that was to come, but Christ rules and governs his house as Lord.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5</a> as far as <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>.

Moses was faithful as a servant <span class="ital">in</span> the house (<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>), Christ as a Son <span class="ital">over</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span>) his house. <span class="greekheb">θεράπων</span> denotes a free servant in an honourable position and is the word applied to Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>. [“Apud Homerum nomen est non servile sed ministros significat voluntarios, nec raro de viris dicitur nobili genere natis” (Stephanus). It is especially used of those who serve the gods. See Pindar <span class="ital">Olymp</span>. iii. 29.] Both the fidelity and the inferior position of Moses are indicated in the words which occur like a refrain in Exodus: “According to all that the Lord commanded, so did he”. Nothing was left to his own initiative; he had to be instructed and commanded; but all that was entrusted to him, he executed with absolute exactness. The crowning proof of his fidelity was given in the extraordinary scene (Exodus 37), where Moses refused to be “made a great nation” in room of Israel. He is said to have been faithful <span class="greekheb">εἰς μαρτύριον τῶν λαληθησομένων</span>. The meaning is, the testimony to his faithfulness which God had pronounced was the guarantee of the trustworthiness of the report he gave of what the Lord afterwards spoke to him. This meaning seems to be determined by the context in Numbers 12. “My servant Moses … is faithful in all my house. I <span class="ital">will speak to him</span> mouth to mouth, apparently and not in dark speeches.” Grotius says “ut pronuntiaret populo ea quae Deus ei dicenda quoquo tempore mandabat”. Bleek and Davidson refer the <span class="greekheb">μαρτύριον</span> to Moses not to God. “He was a servant <span class="ital">for a testimony, i.e.</span>, to bear testimony of those things which were to be spoken, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, from time to time revealed. Reference might be made to Barnabas viii. 3, <span class="greekheb">εἰς μαρτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῶν φυλῶν</span>. The meaning advocated by Calvin, Delitzsch, Westcott and others is attractive. They understand the words as referring to the things which were to be spoken by Christ, and that the whole of Moses’ work was for a testimony of those things. Thus Westcott translates “for a testimony of the things which should be spoken by God through the prophets and finally through Christ”. This gives a fine range to the words, but the context in Numbers is decisively against it. The idea seems to be that Moses being but a <span class="greekheb">θεράπων</span> needed a testimonial to his fidelity that the people might trust him; and also that he had no initiative but could only report to the people the words that God might speak to him. In contrast to this position of Moses, <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς ὡς υἱὸς ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ</span>, Christ’s fidelity was that of “a Son over his house”. It was not the fidelity which exactly performs what another commands and faithfully enters into and fulfils His will. It is the fidelity of one who himself is possessed by the same love and conceives the same purposes as the Father. The interests of the house and the family are the Son’s interests. “We are His house” and in Christ we see that the interests of God and man, of the Father and the family are one. [Grotius quotes the jurisconsults: “etiam vivente patre filium quodam modo dominum esse rerum paternarum”.] But this house so faithfully administered by the Son Himself is the body of Christian people, <span class="greekheb">οὗ οἶκός ἐσμεν ἡμεῖς</span>, we are those on whom this fidelity is spent. The relative finds its antecedent in <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>. The “house of God” is, in the Gospels, the Temple; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1 Peter 4:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1 Timothy 3:15</a> it has the same meaning as here, the people or Church of God. “Whose house are we,” but with a condition <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν τὴν παρρησίαν</span> … <span class="greekheb">κατάσχωμεν</span>, “if we shall have held fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end”. For, as throughout the Epistle, so here, all turns on perseverance, <span class="greekheb">παρρησία</span> originally “frank speech,” hence the boldness which prompts it. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-35.htm" title="Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.">Hebrews 10:35</a>; so in Paul and John. <span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span>, not as the form of the word might indicate, “the object of boasting,” but the disposition as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?">1 Corinthians 5:6</a> : <span class="greekheb">οὐ καλὸν τὸ καύχημα ὑμῶν</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2 Corinthians 5:12</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἀφορμὴν διδόντες ὑμῖν καυχήματος</span>.

The Christian’s hope of a heavenly inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>), of perfected fellowship with God, should be so sure that it confidently proclaims itself, and instead of being shamefaced glories in the future it anticipates. And this attitude must be maintained <span class="greekheb">μέχρι τέλους βεβαίαν</span>, until difficulty and trial are past and hope has become possession. <span class="greekheb">βεβαίαν</span> In agreement with the remoter substantive, which might give some colour to the idea that the expression was lifted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a> and inserted here; but Bleek shows by several instances that the construction is legitimate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">in all his house</span>] i.e. in all God’s house. Two “houses” are contemplated, Mosaism and Christianity, the Law and the Gospel. Both were established by God. In the household of the Law, Moses was the faithful minister; in the household of the Gospel, Christ took on Him, indeed, “the form of a slave,” and as such was faithful even unto death, but yet was Son <span class="ital">over</span> the House. This seems a more natural explanation than that the writer regards both the covenants as one Household, <span class="ital">in</span> which Moses was a servant, and <span class="ital">over</span> which Christ was a Son.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as a servant</span>] The word used is not <span class="ital">doulos</span> “slave,” nor <span class="ital">diakonos</span> “minister,” but <span class="ital">therapôn</span> “voluntary attendant.” It is also applied to Moses in the Ep. of Barnabas and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-31.htm" title="And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did on the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.">Exodus 14:31</a> (LXX.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after</span>] They were to be spoken afterwards by Christ, the Prophet to whom Moses had pointed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm" title="The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the middle of you, of your brothers, like to me; to him you shall listen;">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>.

They were but a shadow of the coming reality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>). But although it is natural for us to understand the expression in this way, the author possibly meant no more than that the faithfulness of Moses was an attestation of the Law which was about to be delivered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>) Another reason for the superiority of Christ to Moses.—<span class="greekheb">θεράπων</span>, <span class="ital">servant</span>) So the LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>.

In ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a>, there is a verbal parallelism, which however at the same time infers a like reason, viz. what Moses, in accordance with the time, Numbers 12, both had spoken and was about to speak. Miriam did not assail the authority of Moses respecting the past; but she wished to claim just as much for herself for the future, on account of certain past specimens (of God speaking by her and Aaron).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterwards to be spoken; but Christ, as Son over his house</span>. We have already anticipated the explanation of this passage, which, according to the view taken above, is a setting forth of the distinction between Christ and Moses intended from the first; that of one being "Son over," the other but "servant <span class="accented">in</span>," the house of God. The rendering of the A.V., "his own house," in ver. 6, where Christ is spoken of, is not justifiable. It is true that we have no means of knowing whether <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> was intended, and that even <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> might, according to the usage of Hellenistic Greek, refer to Christ; but if the writer had so intended it, he might easily have avoided ambiguity by writing <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, etc. He has not done so; and, therefore, it is most natural to take "<span class="accented">his</span> house" in the same sense throughout the passage; viz. as" <span class="accented">God's</span> house," referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, whence the expression is taken. We observe further that "the things that were afterwards to be spoken (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" must be taken as denoting the future "speaking" of God to man "in his SON" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>); not, as some interpret, the speaking through Moses himself in the Law. Moses was inferior to Christ, not only in respect to his personal position as a servant, but also in respect to his work as such; which was only to testify beforehand, typically and prophetically, to a fuller revelation to come. <span class="cmt_word">Whose house we are</span>. Here begins the transition to the warning intended when the "holy brethren" were first called on to "consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession," who has now been seen to be so much greater than Moses. We Christians constitute this completed "house of God," over which Christ reigns as Son; if only warned by the example of the Israelites under Moses, we forfeit not our higher calling. This condition is expressed by <span class="cmt_word">If we hold fast the confidence</span> (or, <span class="accented">our confidence</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and the rejoicing</span> (rather, <span class="accented">boast</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> our) <span class="cmt_word">hope firm unto the end</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> (often rendered "boldness;" see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 35</a>) is the confidence felt by assured believers; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is the boast thereupon ensuing.

In Class. and N.T. the word emphasizes the performance of a present service, without reference to the condition of the doer, whether bond or free. An ethical character attaches to it, as to the kindred verb &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;: service of an affectionate, hearty character, performed with care and fidelity. Hence the relation of the &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; is of a nobler and freer character than that of the &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; or bondservant. The verb is used of a physician's tendance of the sick. Xenophon (Mem. iv. 3, 9) uses it of the gods taking care of men, and, on the other hand, of men's worshipping the gods (ii, 1. 28). See Eurip.

Others, however, explain of the things which Moses himself was afterward to speak to the people by God's command, referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>. According to this explanation, the fidelity hitherto exhibited by Moses ought to command respect for all that he might say in future. But (1) in the present connection that thought is insignificant. (2) It would be an exaggeration to speak of Moses's fidelity to God throughout his whole official career as a witness of the things which he was to speak to the people by God's command. (3) The future participle requires a reference to a time subsequent to Moses's ministry. The meaning is that Moses, in his entire ministry, was but a testimony to what was to be spoken in the future by another and a greater than he.
