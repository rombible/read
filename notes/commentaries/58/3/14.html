Two different words in the two verses are rendered “confidence” in the Authorised version. The former, as we have seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>), is “boldness;” the latter (here used) is applied to men who make a firm stand when attacked, who stand firmly under pressure.

The same spirit with which Christians set out in the ways of God, they should maintain unto the end. Perseverance in faith is the best evidence of the sincerity of our faith. Hearing the word often is a means of salvation, yet, if not hearkened to, it will expose more to the Divine wrath. The happiness of being partakers of Christ and his complete salvation, and the fear of God's wrath and eternal misery, should stir us up to persevere in the life of obedient faith. Let us beware of trusting to outward privileges or professions, and pray to be numbered with the true believers who enter heaven, when all others fail because of unbelief. As our obedience follows according to the power of our faith, so our sins and want of care are according to the prevailing of unbelief in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we are made partakers of Christ - We are spiritually united to the Saviour. We become one with him. We partake of his spirit and his allotments. The sacred writers are accustomed to describe the Christian as being closely united to the Saviour, and as being one with him see the <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a> notes; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm">Ephesians 5:30</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a> note. The idea is, that we participate in all that pertains to him. It is a union of feeling and affection; a union of principle and of congeniality; a union of dependence as well as love; a union where nothing is to be imparted by us, but everything gained; and a union, therefore, on the part of the Redeemer of great condescension. It is the union of the branch to the vine, where the branch is supported and nourished by the vine, and not the union of the ivy and the oak, where the ivy has its own roots, and merely clings around the oak and climbs up upon it. What else can be said so honorable of man as that he is a "partaker of Christ;" that he shares his feelings here, and that he is to share his honors in a brighter world? Compared with this, what is it to participate with the rich and the frivolous in their pleasures; what would it be to share in the honors of conquerors and kings?<p>&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  metochoi tou Christou cannot signify, as some explain, participation merely in the blessings of Christ's death, but must be referred, as our author here affirms, to the spiritual union which subsists between Christ and his people. That union doubtless involves, as necessary consequents, "a union of feeling and affection, a union of principle and congeniality, a union of dependence and love." Yet, we think, it is something more. It is a "real" and vital union, formed by the one Spirit of Christ, pervading the head and the members of the mystical body. And this is the "foundation" of all union of affection, etc. For a condensed view of the subject, see the supplementary note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>.)<p>If we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast - see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>. If we continue to maintain the same confidence which we had in the beginning, or which we showed at the commencement of our Christian life. At first, they had been firm in the Christian hope. They evinced true and strong attachment to the Redeemer. They were ardent and devoted to his cause. If they continued to maintain that to the end, that is, the end of life; if in the midst of all temptations and trials they adhered inflexibly to the cause of the Saviour, they would show that they were true Christians, and would partake of the blessedness of the heavenly world with the Redeemer. The idea is, that it is only perseverance in the ways of religion that constitutes certain evidence of piety. Where piety is manifested through life, or where there is an untiring devotion to the cause of God, there the evidence is clear and undoubted.<p>But where there is at first great ardor, zeal, and confidence, which soon dies away, then it is clear that they never had any real attachment to him and his cause. It may be remarked here, that the "beginning of the confidence" of those who are deceived, and who know nothing about religion at heart, is often as bold as where there is true piety. The hypocrite makes up in ardor what he lacks in sincerity; and he who is really deceived, is usually deceived under the influence of some strong and vivid emotion, which he mistakes for true religion. Often the sincere convert is calm, though decided, and sometimes is even timorous and doubting; while the self-deceiver is noisy in profession, and clamorous in his zeal, and much disposed to blame the lukewarmness of others. Evidence of piety, therefore, should not be built on that early zeal; nor should it be concluded that because there is ardor, there is of necessity genuine religion. Ardor is valuable, and true religion is ardent; but there is other ardor than what the gospel inspires. The evidence of genuine piety is to be found in what will bear us up under trials, and endure amidst persecution and opposition. The doctrine here is, that it is necessary to persevere if we would have the evidence of true piety. This doctrine is taught everywhere in the Scriptures. Persevere in what? I answer, not:<p>(1) merely in a profession of religion. A man may do that and have no piety.<p>(2) not in zeal for party, or sect. The Pharisees had that to the end of their lives.<p>(3) not in mere honesty, and correctness of external deportment. A man may do that in the church, as well as out of it, and yet have no religion.<p>But we should persevere:<p>(1) in the love of God and of Christ - in conscious, ardent, steady attachment to Him to whom our lives are professedly devoted.<p>(2) in the secret duties of religion. In that watchfulness over the heart; that communion with God; that careful study of the Bible; that guardianship over the temper; and in that habitual contact with God in secret prayer which is appropriate to a Christian, and which marks the Christian character.<p>(3) in the performance of the public duties of religion; in leading a "Christian" life - as distinguished from a life of worldliness and vanity; a life of mere morality, and honesty; a life such as thousands lead who are out of the church.<p>There is something which distinguishes a Christian from one who is not a Christian; a religious from an irreligious man. There is "something" in religion; "something" which serves to characterize a Christian, and unless that something is manifested, there can be no evidence of true piety. The Christian is to be distinguished in temper, feeling, deportment, aims, plans, from the people of this world - and unless those characteristics are shown in the life and deportment, there can be no well-founded evidence of religion.<p>Learn:<p>(1) that it is not mere "feeling" that furnishes evidence of religion.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

This is a repetition in another form of the assertion of our position as Christians, with the appended condition, in ver. 6.

The first is undoubtedly the ordinary sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with a genitive in classical Greek, and generally in the New Testament (cf. e.g. infra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), and is on this ground maintained by Bleek, Alford, and others; but in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, followed by a genitive, is as undoubtedly used for" partner" or "companion;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-63.htm">Psalm 119:63</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which has been already cited (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>), and justifies, as it may prove suggested, the expression in this sense here. Cf. also in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-7.htm">Luke 5:7</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, though without an expressed genitive following, occurs in the sense of "partner." Further, the second sense accords better than the first with the view of our relation to Christ so far set forth in the Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> On the word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (translated "confidence"), see what was said under Hebrews 1:3. All the ancient interpreters understood it here in the same general sense as in the former passage - that of <span class="accented">substance</span> or <span class="accented">subsistence</span>, either as denoting our subsistence as members of Christ, or our faith regarded as the substance of our Christian life, or with other modifications of the general meaning. Modern commentators agree in understanding merely the sense in which the word is found to be commonly used by the Alexandrian writers - that of <span class="accented">confidence</span>, derived from the physical conception of a firm foundation. It thus corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 6. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "The beginning" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) of this confidence refers to the earlier stage of the experiences of the Hebrew Christians, before their faith had shown any signs of wavering. There is no sufficient ground for Ebrard's inference from this expression, that the Epistle was not addressed to the Hebrew Church at large, which was the oldest of all Churches, but to "a circle of catechumens and neophytes." The phrase does not imply that the "beginning" was recent. All it need mean is, "Go on as you began." Further, we find, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, a distinct intimation that the Church addressed is one of old standing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Unto the end "may have an individual reference to the end of life, or (the Church being addressed as a community expecting the second advent) a general one to the close of the period of grace during which "<span class="accented">it</span> is called Today." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We are made partakers of Christ (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Rend. we are become fellows with Christ.
