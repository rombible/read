The same spirit with which Christians set out in the ways of God, they should maintain unto the end. Perseverance in faith is the best evidence of the sincerity of our faith. Hearing the word often is a means of salvation, yet, if not hearkened to, it will expose more to the Divine wrath. The happiness of being partakers of Christ and his complete salvation, and the fear of God's wrath and eternal misery, should stir us up to persevere in the life of obedient faith. Let us beware of trusting to outward privileges or professions, and pray to be numbered with the true believers who enter heaven, when all others fail because of unbelief. As our obedience follows according to the power of our faith, so our sins and want of care are according to the prevailing of unbelief in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>While it is said, Today ... - That is, persevere as long as life lasts, or as long as it can be said "today;" and by persevering in this manner you will have evidence that you are the friends of the Redeemer.

But in the first case one must expect <span class="greekheb">ἄχρις οὗ λέγεται</span>, or something similar, in place of <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι</span>. In the other cases <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-15.htm" title="While it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.">Hebrews 3:15</a> would drag as a feeble addition; in the last, moreover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a> would, contrary to all probability, become a parenthesis. (3) <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-15.htm" title="While it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.">Hebrews 3:15</a> is combined with that which follows.

On the contrary, from the tenor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-1.htm" title="Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.">Hebrews 4:1</a>, it is indubitable that this verse is represented by virtue of <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> as a consequence from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/3-16.htm" title="For some, when they had heard, did provoke: however, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses....">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>.

This view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-16.htm" title="For some, when they had heard, did provoke: however, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.">Hebrews 3:16</a>, appearing only rarely in antiquity (in the Peshito, with Chrysostom and Theodoret), and only asserted afresh since the beginning of last century, is now almost universally regarded as the true one. According to the mode of interpretation formerly current, two affirmative statements were recognised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-16.htm" title="For some, when they had heard, did provoke: however, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.">Hebrews 3:16</a>, the first of which was limited by the second. <span class="greekheb">τινές</span> was accordingly written instead of <span class="greekheb">τίνες</span>,[61] and the thought was found expressed that <span class="ital">some</span>, it is true, but by no means the totality of the Israelites, proved rebellious. As those who formed an exception to the rebelliousness or unbelief of the <span class="greekheb">τινές</span>, expositors accordingly thought either of Joshua and Caleb only (so Oecumenius, Theophylact, Primasius, Seb. Schmidt, Owen, and others), or else, with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm" title="Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.">Numbers 14:29</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-45.htm" title="So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;">Numbers 1:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-47.htm" title="But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.">Numbers 1:47</a>, at the same time of all the Israelites who, at the numbering, had not attained an age of twenty years, as also the Levites and women (so Cornelius a Lapide, Braun, Carpzov, <span class="ital">al</span>.). But, considering the small number of responsible believers, which, in comparison with the enormous total mass of responsible unbelievers (more than six hundred thousand), retires altogether into the background, the latter could not possibly be designated by the mere <span class="greekheb">τινές</span>; nor can appeal be made for the opposite view to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-7.htm" title="Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play....">1 Corinthians 10:7-10</a>, since the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΙΝΈς</span></span></span> there several times recurring specializes only the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΤΟῖς ΠΛΕΊΟΣΙΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5</a>, in its different subdivisions.

Bleek, Delitzsch, von Soden and others construe them with what follows, beginning at this point a fresh paragraph. The meaning would thus be: “Since it is said, ‘To-day if ye hear his voice, harden not, etc.,’ who are meant, who were they who heard and provoked?” This is inviting but the <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-16.htm" title="For some, when they had heard, did provoke: however, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.">Hebrews 3:16</a> is decidedly against it. Davidson connects <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ λεγ</span>. with what immediately precedes: “ ‘if we hold fast … unto the end, while it is said,’ <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, not <span class="ital">during</span> the time that it is said, but in the presence and consciousness of the saying, Harden not, etc.… with this divine warning always in the ears”. Similarly Weiss. Westcott connects the words with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-13.htm" title="But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.">Hebrews 3:13</a>, making 14 parenthetical. Either of these constructions is feasible. It is also possible to let the sentence stand by itself as introductory to what follows, taking <span class="greekheb">μὴ σκληρ</span>. as directly addressed to the Hebrews, not as merely completing the quotation: “While it is being said To-day if ye hear His voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation”. The <span class="greekheb">λέγεσθαι</span> thus contains only the clause ending with <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσητε</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-15.htm" title="While it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.">Hebrews 3:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">while it is said</span>) The connection is with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-13.htm" title="But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.">Hebrews 3:13</a>, in reference to <span class="greekheb">παρακαλεῖτε</span>.

Delitzsch finds it in ver. 16, taken as an interrogation (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span>: see below); thus: "When it is said, Today...  harden not your hearts as in the provocation,...  who did provoke? Nay, did not all?" The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> he accounts for by its idiomatic use found in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-31.htm">Acts 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>, conveying the sense of the English, "<span class="accented">Why</span>, who did provoke?" But this use of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, obvious in the texts adduced as parallel, would be forced here; the structure of the sentence does not easily lend itself to it. Still, this is the view taken by Tholuck, Bleek, De Wette, Lunemann, and others, as well as Delitzsch. But, notwithstanding such weighty support, difficulties are surely best avoided by taking <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not as commencing a new sentence, but in connection with ver. 14 preceding, as it seems most natural to take it in the absence of any connecting particle to mark a new proposition. In this case the translation of the A.V. gives a fully satisfactory sense: "If we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end, while it is still being said, To-day," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (as in ver. 13) "so long as it is called Today." Ebrard, Alford, and others, taking the same view of the connection of the words, prefer the translation, "In that it is said." But the other seems more in accordance with the thought pervading the passage. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>While it is said (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>The formula by which the writer reverts to the previous citation. Connect with if we hold fast. The exhortation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> answered to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/95-1.htm">Psalm 95:1-11</a>; so the condition of fulfillment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a> is declared to rest on the same Scripture. Only on the ground of what is said in that Psalm does the holding fast come to pass. Rend. therefore, "We are fellows of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end, seeing it is said," etc. </body></html>
