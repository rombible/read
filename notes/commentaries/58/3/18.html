Those with whom God was angry had provoked God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-16.htm" title="For some, when they had heard, did provoke: however, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.">Hebrews 3:16</a>), had sinned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-17.htm" title="But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?">Hebrews 3:17</a>), had been disobedient, had refused to believe His word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-19.htm" title="So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.">Hebrews 3:19</a>). The action of the Israelites (Numbers 14) involved at once disobedience to God’s command that they should advance to the conquest of the land, and want of faith in the promise which made victory sure.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:14-19 The saints' privilege is, they are made partakers of Christ, that is, of the Spirit, the nature, graces, righteousness, and life of Christ; they are interested in all Christ is, in all he has done, or will do. The same spirit with which Christians set out in the ways of God, they should maintain unto the end. Perseverance in faith is the best evidence of the sincerity of our faith. Hearing the word often is a means of salvation, yet, if not hearkened to, it will expose more to the Divine wrath. The happiness of being partakers of Christ and his complete salvation, and the fear of God's wrath and eternal misery, should stir us up to persevere in the life of obedient faith. Let us beware of trusting to outward privileges or professions, and pray to be numbered with the true believers who enter heaven, when all others fail because of unbelief. As our obedience follows according to the power of our faith, so our sins and want of care are according to the prevailing of unbelief in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And to whom sware he - note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-11.htm">Hebrews 3:11</a>.<p>But to them that believed not - That did not confide in God; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-32.htm">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>. "Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God." In consequence of this want of faith, God solemnly sware unto them that they should not enter into the promised land; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-34.htm">Deuteronomy 1:34-35</a>. "And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, "Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I sware to give unto your fathers, save Caleb," etc. The distinct reason, therefore, assigned by Moses why they did not enter the promised land, was a want of faith, and this accords directly with the design of the apostle here. He is exhorting those whom he addressed to beware of an evil heart of unbelief; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>. He says that it was such a heart that excluded the Hebrews from the promised land. The same thing, says he, must exclude you from heaven - the promised home of the believer; and if that firm confidence in God and his promises which he requires is wanting, you will be excluded from the world of eternal rest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. to them that believed not&#8212;rather as Greek, "to them that disobeyed."
