The two are united in the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>, “the <span class= "ital">throne</span> of <span class= "ital">grace.</span>” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>.) The beautiful rendering, “touched with the feeling of our infirmities,” is due to the Genevan Testament of 1557.<p><span class= "bld">But was in all points . . .</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">but One that hath in all points been tempted in like manner, apart from sin.</span> These words show the nature and the limits of this sympathy of Christ. He suffers with His people, not merely showing compassion to those who are suffering and tempted, but taking to Himself a joint feeling of their weaknesses. He can do this because He has passed through trial, has Himself been tempted. In speaking of “weaknesses” the writer uses a word applicable both to the people and to their Lord, who was “crucified through weakness” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.">2Corinthians 13:4</a>). Its meaning must not be limited to the region of pain and bodily suffering: whatever belongs to the necessary limitations of that human nature which He assumed is included. As He learned His obedience from sufferings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>), He gained His knowledge of the help we need in that “Himself took our weaknesses” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>), and was Himself tempted in like manner, save that in Him sin had no place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>). These last words supply the limit to the thought of weakness and temptation as applied to our High Priest. Not only was the temptation fruitless in <span class= "ital">leading to</span> sin (this is implied here, but only as a part or a result of another truth), but in the widest sense He could say, “The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in Me” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>). “Was tempted in all points in like manner,” are words which must not be over-pressed; but the essential principles of temptation may be traced in those with which Jesus was assailed. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-25.htm" title="And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.">John 21:25</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">For we have not a high-priest, </span>&c. — As if he had said, Though he be so great, yet he is not without concern for us in our mean and low condition. Here the apostle lets the Hebrews know that in the gospel there is no loss of privilege in any thing. Had they a high-priest who, with his office, was the life and glory of their profession and worship? We also, says he, have a High-Priest, who is, in like manner, the life and glory of our profession and service; and not one <span class="ital">who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities </span>— Or, <span class="ital">who cannot, </span><span class="greekheb">συμπαθησαι ταις ασθενειαις ημων</span>, <span class="ital">sympathize with our weaknesses, </span>our temptations, trials, and troubles, of whatever kind they may be, ghostly or bodily. The Son of God, having been made flesh, experienced all the temptations and miseries incident to mankind, sin excepted; consequently he must always have a lively feeling of our infirmities; of our wants, weaknesses, miseries, dangers; <span class="ital">but was in all points tempted </span>— That is, tried; <span class="ital">like as we are — </span><span class="greekheb">Καθ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">ομοιοτητα</span>, according to a similitude of our trials, or with such as belong to human nature. What is here said of the similarity of our Lord’s trials to ours, does not imply an exact likeness; for he was free from that corruption of nature which, as the consequence of Adam’s sin, has infected all mankind; which is intimated likewise in the expression, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>,) <span class="ital">sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh; yet without sin </span>— For he never committed any; and is able to preserve us in all our temptations from the commission of it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Observe the end proposed: rest spiritual and eternal; the rest of grace here, and glory hereafter; in Christ on earth, with Christ in heaven. After due and diligent labour, sweet and satisfying rest shall follow; and labour now, will make that rest more pleasant when it comes. Let us labour, and quicken each other to be diligent in duty. The Holy Scriptures are the word of God. When God sets it home by his Spirit, it convinces powerfully, converts powerfully, and comforts powerfully. It makes a soul that has long been proud, to be humble; and a perverse spirit, to be meek and obedient. Sinful habits, that are become as it were natural to the soul, and rooted deeply in it, are separated and cut off by this sword. It will discover to men their thoughts and purposes, the vileness of many, the bad principles they are moved by, the sinful ends they act to. The word will show the sinner all that is in his heart. Let us hold fast the doctrines of Christian faith in our heads, its enlivening principles in our hearts, the open profession of it in our lips, and be subject to it in our lives. Christ executed one part of his priesthood on earth, in dying for us; the other he executes in heaven, pleading the cause, and presenting the offerings of his people. In the sight of Infinite Wisdom, it was needful that the Saviour of men should be one who has the fellow-feeling which no being but a fellow-creature could possibly have; and therefore it was necessary he should actual experience of all the effects of sin that could be separated from its actual guilt. God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, Ro 8:3; but the more holy and pure he was, the more he must have been unwilling in his nature to sin, and must have had deeper impression of its evil; consequently the more must he be concerned to deliver his people from its guilt and power. We should encourage ourselves by the excellence of our High Priest, to come boldly to the throne of grace. Mercy and grace are the things we want; mercy to pardon all our sins, and grace to purify our souls. Besides our daily dependence upon God for present supplies, there are seasons for which we should provide in our prayers; times of temptation, either by adversity or prosperity, and especially our dying time. We are to come with reverence and godly fear, yet not as if dragged to the seat of justice, but as kindly invited to the mercy-seat, where grace reigns. We have boldness to enter into the holiest only by the blood of Jesus; he is our Advocate, and has purchased all our souls want or can desire.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched - Our High Priest is not cold and unfeeling. That is, we have one who is abundantly qualified to sympathize with us in our afflictions, and to whom, therefore, we may look for aid and support in trials. Had we a high priest who was cold and heartless; who simply performed the external duties of his office without entering into the sympathies of those who came to seek for pardon; who had never experienced any trials, and who felt himself above those who sought his aid, we should necessarily feel disheartened in attempting to overcome our sins, and to live to God. His coldness would repel us; his stateliness would awe us; his distance and reserve would keep us away, and perhaps render us indifferent to all desire to be saved. But tenderness and sympathy attract those who are feeble, and kindness does more than anything else to encourage those who have to encounter difficulties and dangers; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm">Hebrews 2:16-18</a>. Such tenderness and sympathy has our Great High Priest.<p>But was in all points tempted like as we are - "Tried" as we are; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-18.htm">Hebrews 2:18</a>. He was subjected to all the kinds of trial to which we can be, and he is, therefore, able to sympathize with us and to aid us. He was tempted - in the literal sense; he was persecuted; he was poor; he was despised; he suffered physical pain; he endured the sorrows of a lingering and most cruel death.<p>Yet without sin - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>. "Who did no sin;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, "He had done no violence, neither was there any deceit in his mouth;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>, "Who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners." The importance of this fact - that the Great High Priest of the Christian profession was "without sin," the apostle illustrates at length in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7-9</a>. He here merely alludes to it, and says that one who was "without sin" was able to assist those who were sinners, and who put their trust in him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. For&#8212;the motive to "holding our profession" (Heb 4:14), namely the sympathy and help we may expect from our High Priest. Though "great" (Heb 4:14), He is not above caring for us; nay, as being in all points one with us as to manhood, sin only excepted, He sympathizes with us in every temptation. Though exalted to the highest heavens, He has changed His place, not His nature and office in relation to us, His condition, but not His affection. Compare Mt 26:38, "watch with me": showing His desire in the days of His flesh for the sympathy of those whom He loved: so He now gives His suffering people His sympathy. Compare Aaron, the type, bearing the names of the twelve tribes in the breastplate of judgment on his heart, when he entered into the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually (Ex 28:29).<p>cannot be touched with the feeling of&#8212;Greek, "cannot sympathize with our infirmities": our weaknesses, physical and moral (not sin, but liability to its assaults). He, though sinless, can sympathize with us sinners; His understanding more acutely perceived the forms of temptation than we who are weak can; His will repelled them as instantaneously as the fire does the drop of water cast into it. He, therefore, experimentally knew what power was needed to overcome temptations. He is capable of sympathizing, for He was at the same time tempted without sin, and yet truly tempted [Bengel]. In Him alone we have an example suited to men of every character and under all circumstances. In sympathy He adapts himself to each, as if He had not merely taken on Him man's nature in general, but also the peculiar nature of that single individual.<p>but&#8212;"nay, rather, He was (one) tempted" [Alford].<p>like as we are&#8212;Greek, "according to (our) similitude."<p>without sin&#8212;Greek, "choris," "separate from sin" (Heb 7:26). If the Greek "aneu" had been used, sin would have been regarded as the object absent from Christ the subject; but choris here implies that Christ, the subject, is regarded as separated from sin the object [Tittmann]. Thus, throughout His temptations in their origin, process, and result, sin had nothing in Him; He was apart and separate from it [Alford].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities:</span> this duty of perseverance in the Christian religion, is enforced by the consideration of the sympathy of this High Priest, with the states of all who will enter into God’s rest by him. He is worthy that we should hold it fast, being without impotency. It is impossible he should be pitiless to penitent sinners, though he be glorious, there being nothing in himself, or out of himself, indisposing him to it. eumpayhsai imports such a sympathy or fellow feeling, as makes him like affected as if he were in the same case with them.

As God, he is infinitely merciful; as man, inwardly feeling them, even all the miseries they were liable to, but sinful ones. He wants no bowels, but he hath, as a fellow feeling, so a fellow grieving, and fellow caring for the redress of them, even all such as are fit for his pity; and works on affections, a sense of guilt, fears, doubts, tremblings, weak-workings to God, the concomitant infirmities of sinful souls; all the weaknesses of grace in us, all troubles, distresses, anguishes in the flesh, the fruits of sin. He knows these sensibly as man, which as God singly he could not. These sinful weaknesses of soul inclining to sin, and disabling from resisting temptations, by which the subtle, powerful enemy of our soul prevaileth over us to the accumulating of sin and guilt daily and so need this sympathy of his to us-ward: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-2.htm" title="Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.">Hebrews 5:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.">1 Corinthians 2:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ?

Yet under all these temptations he was sinless, as the Holy One of God; never did temptation prevail over him, he overcame all. Nothing was out of place or order by his sufferings in him: all his affections and passions under these, regular, showing his innocency under variety of sufferings, and eminency of compassions. Sin hardens bowels, but he is compassionate without any mixture with or hinderance by corruption; and his intercession is the more effectual with God for us.

Jesus is able to sympathise with <span class="greekheb">ταῖς ἀσθενείαις ἡμῶν</span> “our infirmities,” the weaknesses which undermine our resistance to temptation and make it difficult to hold fast our confession: moral weaknesses, therefore, though often implicated with physical weaknesses. Jesus can feel for these because <span class="greekheb">πεπειρασμένον κατὰ πάντα καθʼ ὁμοιότητα</span>, He has been tempted in all respects as we are. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πάντα</span>, classical, “in all respects,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> Wetstein on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-22.htm" title="Then Paul stood in the middle of Mars' hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.">Acts 17:22</a></span>; and Evagrius, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-4.htm" title="And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.">Hebrews 5:4</a>, of Christ incarnate, <span class="greekheb">ὁμοιοπαθῆ κατὰ πάντα χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὁμοιότητα</span> may either mean “according to the likeness of our temptations,” or, “in accordance with His likeness to us”.

The writer wishes to preclude the common fancy that there was some peculiarity in Jesus which made His temptation wholly different from ours, that He was a mailed champion exposed to toy arrows. On the contrary, He has felt in His own consciousness the difficulty of being righteous in this world; has felt pressing upon Himself the reasons and inducements that incline men to choose sin that they may escape suffering and death; in every part of His human constitution has known the pain and conflict with which alone temptation can be overcome; has been so tempted that had He sinned, He would have had a thousandfold better excuse than ever man had. Even though His divinity may have ensured His triumph, His temptation was true and could only be overcome by means that are open to all. The one difference between our temptations and those of Jesus is that His were <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span>. Riehm thinks this expression is not exhausted by declaring the fact that in Christ’s case temptation never resulted in sin. It means, he thinks, further, and rather, that temptation never in Christ’s case sprang from any sinful desire in Himself. So also Delitzsch, Weiss, Westcott, etc. But if Theophylact is right in his indication of the motive of the writer in introducing the words, then it is Christ’s successful resistance of temptation which is in the foreground; <span class="greekheb">ὥστε δύνασθε καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσιν χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας διαγενέσθαι</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>] He gives the reason for holding fast our confession; [we may do so with confidence], for Christ can sympathise with us in our weaknesses, since He has suffered with us (<span class="greekheb">συμπάσχειν</span>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-26.htm" title="And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the feeling of our infirmities</span>] Even the heathen could feel the force and beauty of this appeal, for they intensely admired the famous line of Terence,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“I am a man; I feel an interest in everything which is human;” at the utterance of which, when the play was first acted, it is said that the whole of the audience rose to their feet; and the exquisite words which Virgil puts into the mouth of Dido,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Haud ignara mali, miseris succerrere disco</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">tempted</span>] “Tempted” (<span class="greekheb">πεπειρασμένον</span>) is the best-supported reading, not <span class="greekheb">πεπειραμένον</span>, “having made trial of,” “experienced in.” It refers alike to the trials of life, which are in themselves <span class="ital">indirect</span> temptations—sometimes to sin, always to murmuring and discontent; and to the <span class="ital">direct</span> temptations to sin which are life’s severest trials.

It was both asserted by Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>) and by the Apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-22.htm" title="Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:">1 Peter 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1 John 3:5</a>, &c).

His temptation was after the likeness of ours, "apart from sin," or "sin except." For similar expressions, though not with definite reference to temptation, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>. But how is the exception of sin to be understood? Is it that, though, like us, tempted, he, unlike us, resisted temptation? Or is it that his sinless nature was incapable of being even solicited by sin? Now, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means sometimes "to tempt to sin," as Satan or our own lusts tempt us (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>, etc.); and also "to prove.... to try," "to test faithfulness," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>, etc., in which sense, with reference especially to afflictive trials, the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is commonly used (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>). That Christ was not only subjected to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in this latter sense, but was also directly assailed by the tempter to sin (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), appears from the Gospel record. But here comes in a difficulty. There can, we conceive, be no real temptation where there is no liability to the sin suggested by temptation, still less where there is no possibility of sinning. But can we imagine any such liability, or even possibility, in the case of the Divine and Sinless One? If not, wherein did the temptation consist? How could it be at all like ours, or one through his own experience of which he can sympathize with us? It was for maintaining, on the strength of such considerations, the theoretic peccability of Christ, that Irving was expelled as heretical flora the Presbyterian communion. The question has undoubtedly its serious difficulties in common with the whole subjeer of the Divine and human in Christ. The following thoughts may, however, aid solution. That Christ, in his human nature, partook of all the original affections of humanity - hope, fear, desire, joy, grief, indignation, shrinking from suffering, and the like - is apparent, not only from his life, but also from the fact that his assumption of our humanity would have otherwise been incomplete. Such affections are not in themselves sinful; they only are so when, under temptation, any of them become inordinate, and serve as motives to transgression of duty. He, in virtue of his Divine personality, could not through them be seduced into sin; but it does not follow that he could not, in his human nature, feel their power to seduce, or rather the power of the tempter to seduce through them, and thus have personal experience of man's temptation. St. John says of one" born of God" that he "doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he <span class="accented">cannot</span> sin, because he is born of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>). He does not mean that the regenerate Christian is not exposed to and does not feel, the power of temptation; only that, so far forth as he lives in the new life from God, he is proof against it; he gives no internal assent to the seduction of the tempter; and so "that wicked one toucheth him net" (ver. 18). What is thus said of one "born of God" may be said much more, and without any qualification, of the Son of God, without denying that he too experienced the power of temptation, though altogether proof against it. Bengel says, "Quomodo autem, <span class="accented">sine pectate</span> tentatus, compati potest tentatis <span class="accented">cum peceato?</span> In intellectu multo acrius anima salvatoris percepit imagines tentantes quam nos infirmi: in voluntato tam celeriter incursum earum retudit quam ignis aquae guttulam sibi objectam. Expertus est igitur qua virtute sit opus ad tentationes vincendas.
