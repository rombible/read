These five particulars are repeated in substance in the present verse: “Seeing, therefore, it is (still) left that some should enter in, and they to whom formerly glad tidings were declared entered not in because of disobedience, He again,” &c. “Disobedience”—though <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a> speaks of <span class= "ital">unbelief</span> as the cause: see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-18.htm" title="And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?">Hebrews 3:18</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm" title="He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.">John 3:36</a>, the transition from “believeth” to “obeyeth” is equally striking.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 The privileges we have under the gospel, are greater than any had under the law of Moses, though the same gospel for substance was preached under both Testaments. There have been in all ages many unprofitable hearers; and unbelief is at the root of all unfruitfulness under the word. Faith in the hearer is the life of the word. But it is a painful consequence of partial neglect, and of a loose and wavering profession, that they often cause men to seem to come short. Let us then give diligence, that we may have a clear entrance into the kingdom of God. As God finished his work, and then rested from it, so he will cause those who believe, to finish their work, and then to enjoy their rest. It is evident, that there is a more spiritual and excellent sabbath remaining for the people of God, than that of the seventh day, or that into which Joshua led the Jews. This rest is, a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires. The rest, or sabbatism, which is the subject of the apostle's reasoning, and as to which he concludes that it remains to be enjoyed, is undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven. But those who do not believe, shall never enter into this spiritual rest, either of grace here or glory hereafter. God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul; and faith in his promises, through his Son, to be the only way of entering that rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein - That is, "Since there is a rest spoken of in the Scriptures, implying that it is to be enjoyed by some, and since they to whom it was first promised did not inherit it, it follows that it must still be in reserve." This is the conclusion which the apostle draws from the argument in the previous verses, and is connected with <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>, where he says that "there remaineth a rest to the people of God" - the point to which the whole argument tended. The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-7.htm">Hebrews 4:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>, is to be regarded as an "interruption" in stating the conclusion, or as the suggestion of a new thought or a new argument bearing on the subject, which he sets down even while stating the conclusion from his argument. It has the appearance of being "suggested" to him as a new thought of importance, and which he preferred to place even in the midst of the summing up of the argument rather than omit it altogether. It denotes a state of mind full of the subject, and where one idea came hastening after another, and which it was deemed important to notice, even though it should seem to be out of place. The "position" in this <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-6.htm">Hebrews 4:6</a> is, that it was a settled or indisputable matter that some would enter into rest. The implied argument to prove this is:<p>(1) that there was a "rest" spoken of which deserved to be called a "divine rest," or the "rest of God;"<p>(2) it could not be supposed that God would prepare such a rest in vain, for it would follow that if he had suited up a world of rest, he designed that it should be occupied. As he knew, therefore, that they to whom it was first offered would not enter in, it must be that he designed it for some others, and that it "remained" to be occupied by us now.<p>And they to whom it was first preached - Margin, "The Gospel." Greek "Evangelized;" that is, to where the good news of the rest was first announced - the Israelites.

Wrongly Delitzsch, according to whom <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΙΝΆς</span></span></span> signifies: “others than those.” Some, again, find in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΕῚ ΟὖΝ ἈΠΟΛΕΊΠΕΤΑΙ ΤΙΝᾺς ΕἸΣΕΛΘΕῖΝ</span></span></span> the meaning: since then the promise, of entering into His rest, is still left, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> awaits its fulfilment. So substantially Bleek: “since it now remains, that the divine rest has not yet been already closed by the complete(?) fulfilment of the prophecy relating thereto, in such wise that no more entrance exists for them.” Against this, however, pleads the fact that the author would then have illogically co-ordinated, the one with the other, the two protases <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-6.htm" title="Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:">Hebrews 4:6</a>, since the first would surely contain the result of the second.

He says: “Vv. 6–8, the author passes to a new thought, to a new point of comparison between the work of Christ and the work of Moses. The opposition between the work of the one and that of the other is twofold.… The first imperfection in the work of Moses consisted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it....">Hebrews 4:2-5</a>) in the fact that his work conferred no power for fulfilment,—did not combine by faith with the hearers,—and on that account did not avail to lead into rest; the second consists in the fact that the rest itself, into which the Israelites might have been led by Moses, and then by Joshua were led in, was only an earthly typical rest, whereas Christ leads into an actual rest, which intrinsically corresponds to the Sabbath-rest of God.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-6.htm" title="Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:">Hebrews 4:6</a>. The writer now, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/4-6.htm" title="Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:...">Hebrews 4:6-9</a>, gathers up the argument, and reaches his conclusion that a Sabbatism remains for God’s people. The argument briefly is, God has provided a rest for men and has promised it to them. This promise was not believed by those who formerly heard it, neither was it exhausted in the bringing in of the people to Canaan. For had it been so, it could not have been renewed long after, as it was. It remains, therefore, to be now enjoyed. “Since, therefore, it remains that some enter into it and those who formerly heard the good news of the promise did not enter, owing to disobedience.” <span class="greekheb">ἀπολείπεται</span>, there remains over as not yet fulfilled. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">σαββατ</span>. is the nominative, here <span class="greekheb">τινας εἰσελθεῖν</span> might be considered a nominative but it is better, with Viteau (256), to construe it as an impersonal verb followed by an infinitive. From the fact that the offer of the rest had been made, or the promise given, “it remains” that some (must) enter in. But a second fact also forms a premiss in the argument. <span class="ital">viz</span>.: that those to whom the promise had formerly been made did not enter in; therefore, over and above and long after (<span class="greekheb">μετὰ τοσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χρόνον</span>) the original proclamation of this gospel of rest, even in David’s time, again (<span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>), God appoints or specifies a certain day (<span class="greekheb">τινὰ ὁρίζει ἡμέραν</span>) saying “To-day”. This proves that the offer is yet open, that the promise holds good in David’s time. The words already quoted (<span class="greekheb">καθὼς προείρηται</span>) from the 95th Psalm prove this, for they run, “To-day, if ye hear His voice,” etc. They prove at any rate that the gospel of rest was not exhausted by the entrance into Canaan under Joshua, “for if Joshua had given them rest, God would not after this speak of another day”. The writer takes for granted that the “To-day” of the Psalm extends to Christian times, whether be cause of the life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>) that is in the word of promise, or because the reference in the Psalm is Messianic. “This ‘voice’ of God which is ‘heard’ is His voice speaking to us in His Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>) and this ‘To-day’ is ‘the end of these days’ in which He has spoken to us in Him, on to the time when He shall come again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-13.htm" title="But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.">Hebrews 3:13</a>). In effect God has been ‘heard’ speaking only twice, to Israel and to us, and what He has spoken to both has been the same,—the promise of entering into His rest. Israel came short of it through unbelief; we do enter into the rest who believe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-3.htm" title="For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.">Hebrews 4:3</a>)” (Davidson). At all events, the conclusion unhesitatingly follows: “Therefore there remains a Sabbath-Rest for the people of God”. <span class="greekheb">ἄρα</span> though often standing first in a sentence in N.T. cannot in classical Greek occupy that place. <span class="greekheb">Σαββατισμός</span>, though found here only in Biblical Greek, occurs in Plutarch (<span class="ital">De Superstit</span>, c. 3). The verb <span class="greekheb">σαββατίζειν</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-30.htm" title="So the people rested on the seventh day.">Exodus 16:30</a> and other places. The word is here employed in preference to <span class="greekheb">κατάπαυσις</span> in order to identify the rest promised to God’s people with the rest enjoyed by God Himself on the Sabbath or Seventh Day. [So Theophylact, <span class="greekheb">ἑρμηνεύει πῶς σαββατ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὠνόμασε τὴν τοιαύτην κατάπαυσιν</span>· <span class="greekheb">διότι</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καταπαύομεν καὶ ἡμεῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων τῶν ἡμετέρων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ καὶ ὁ θεός</span>, <span class="greekheb">καταπαύσας ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων τῶν εἰς σύστασιν τοῦ κόσμου</span>, <span class="greekheb">σάββατον τὴν ἡμέραν ὠνόμασεν</span>.] To explain and justify the introduction of this word, the writer adds <span class="greekheb">ὁ γὰρ εἰσελθὼν</span> … as if he said, I call it a Sabbatism, because it is not an ordinary rest, but one which finds its ideal and actual fulfilment in God’s own rest on the Seventh Day. It is a Sabbatism because in it God’s people reach a definite stage of attainment, of satisfactorily accomplished purpose, as God Himself did when creation was finished. <span class="greekheb">ὁ γὰρ εἰσελθὼν</span>, whoever has entered, not to be restricted to Jesus, as by Alford, <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ</span>, into God’s rest, <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτὸς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. himself also rested from his (the man’s) works as God from His.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The salvation which the writer has previously referred to as a glorious dominion is here spoken of as a Rest. The significance lies in its being God’s rest which man is to share. It is the rest which God has enjoyed since the creation. From all His creative work God could not be said to rest till, after what cannot but appear to us a million of hazards, man appeared, a creature in whose history God Himself could find a worthy history, whose moral and spiritual needs would elicit the Divine resources and exercise what is deepest in God. When man appears God is satisfied, for here is one in His own image. But from this bare statement of the meaning of God’s rest it is obvious that God’s people must share it with Him. God’s rest is satisfaction in man; but this satisfaction can be perfected only when man is in perfect harmony with Him. His rest is not perfect till they rest in Him. This highly spiritual conception of salvation is involved in our Author’s argument. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the grand passage on God’s Rest in Philo, <span class="ital">De Cherubim</span>, c. xxvi., and also Barnabas xv., see also Hughes’ <span class="ital">The Sabbatical Rest of God and Man</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">it remaineth</span>] The promise is still left open, is unexhausted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because of unbelief</span>] Rather, “because of <span class="ital">disobedience</span>” (<span class="ital">apeitheian</span>).

But here the thought is suggested that the Israelites had <span class="accented">not</span> finally failed, for that, though those under Moses did so, the next generation under Joshua did attain the promised land. No, it is replied; the rest of the promised land was but a type after all; it was not the true rest of God: otherwise the psalmist could not have still assigned a day for entering it so long after the arrival at Shiloh; - <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The rest was not appropriated by those under Moses, nor, in the full sense, by those under Joshua, nor in David's time.<p>It remaineth that some must enter therein (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>&#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; "remains over from past times."
