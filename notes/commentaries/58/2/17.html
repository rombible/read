The order of the Greek words throws an emphasis on “compassionate” which is in full harmony with what we have seen to be the pervading tone of the chapter. One who has not so understood the infirmities of his brethren as to be “compassionate,” cannot be their “faithful” representative before God. But the word “faithful” is still more closely connected with the following words. If through the power of sympathy which the Saviour has gained “by sufferings” He becomes “compassionate” as our High Priest, it is through “the suffering of death” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>) that He proves Himself “the faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation (or rather, <span class= "ital">propitiation</span>) for the sins of the people.” The word “high priest,” hereafter to be so prominent in the Epistle, is brought in somewhat suddenly, but several expressions in this chapter (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>) have prepared for and led up to the crowning thought here brought before us. The characteristic function of the high priest was his presentation of the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement, that expiation might be made for the sins of the whole people, that the displeasure of God might not rest on the nation on account of sin. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a>.) The words rendered “propitiate” and “propitiation” are not of frequent occurrence in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10</a>—see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>), but are very often found in the LXX.

And so the paradox of the Cross was worthy of God and like Him. In my text the same series of historical facts, the life of Jesus Christ and His death, considered as a whole, are regarded not as worthy of God, but as that which ‘behoved’ Christ, ‘It behooved’ is stronger than ‘it became.’ The one phrase points to the conformity of the thing in question with God’s character and nature; the other declares that the thing in question has in it a moral necessity or obligation, and that Christ’s assimilation to His fellows, especially in all the ills that flesh is heir to, was laid upon Him as a necessity, in view of His purpose of redemption and the helping of His fellows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So then we have here, in the words which I have read, and in the context, three thoughts on which I touch now. First of all, the completeness of Christ’s assimilation to us, especially in regard to suffering; second, Christ’s sufferings as necessary for the fulfilment of Christ’s design; and lastly and more especially, Christ’s sufferings as indispensable for His priestly office. Now look at these three things briefly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Note, first of all, the emphasis of that expression, ‘it behooved Him to be made in all things like unto His brethren.’</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And observe that the ‘all things’ here, concerning which our Lord’s likeness to mankind is predicated, are not the ordinary properties of human nature, but emphatically and specifically man’s sorrows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That will appear, I think, if you notice that my text is regarded as being a consequence of our Lord’s incarnation for the help of His fellows. ‘He laid not hold upon angels, but He laid hold upon the seed of Abraham.’ Wherefore, ‘in all things it behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, if the likeness here be the possession of true manhood, then my text is mere tautology, and it would simply be saying, ‘He became a man, wherefore it behoved Him to become a man.’ The same conclusion is, I think, fairly to be deduced from the last words of our chapter, where the fact of His suffering being tempted, is stated as His preparation to help, and as His qualification as a merciful and faithful High Priest. That is to say, the ‘all things’ of which our Lord became partaker like us His brethren, are here the whole mass - in all its variety of pressure and diversity of nauseousness and bitterness - the whole mass of human sorrow which has ever made men’s hearts bleed and men’s eyes weep.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christ, in His single manhood, says the writer, gathered unto Himself every form of pain, of misery, of weariness, of burden, which can weigh upon and wear out a human spirit; and no single ingredient that ever made any man’s cup distasteful was left out, in that dreadful draught which He emptied to the dregs ere He passed the chalice to our lips, saying, ‘Drink ye all of it.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is the great lesson and blessed thought of our text that no suffering soul, no harassed heart, no lonely life, has ever been able to say, ‘Ah! I have to bear this by myself, for Jesus Christ never knew anything like this.’ All the pain and sorrow of adverse circumstances, that try some of us, He knows who had ‘not where to lay His head’; who was a poor man all His days, to whom the women had to minister of their charity, and who depended upon others for His sustenance in life, and for cerements, and a grave in death. The sorrows that belong to a physical frame overwrought and crushed by excessive toil; the sorrows of weakness, of sickness, the pains of death - He understands them all. The sorrows that come from our relations to our fellows, whether they be the hopeless, quiet tears that fall for ever upon broken affections and lost loves, or whether they be the bitter griefs that come from unrequited affections and unappreciated aims, and benefits flung back, and hearts tortured by ingratitude - He knows them all. And the loftier and less selfish, more impersonal, griefs that make so large a portion of the weight and heaviness of the noblest spirits, they all cast their shadows across His pure soul, and the shadow was the deeper and the darker because of the very purity of the soul on which it fell. Purity is ever sad in the presence of foulness; and love is ever sorrowful when bowed with the burden of another’s sorrow; and both these sources of pain and grief, which diffuse their bitterness through the lives of the best men, weighed in all their gravity upon Him who felt the world’s sorrow and the world’s sin as a personal grief because His soul was perfectly unselfish, perfectly pure, perfectly united to God, and therefore perfectly clear- sighted. All the miseries of all men forced themselves into and filled Christ’s heart, Dear brother! you and I have but a drop given to us; He drank the whole cup. Our natures are not capable of sorrow as varied, as deep, as poignant as the sorrow of Jesus Christ; but for each of us surely the assurance comes with some subtle power of consolation and strength, ‘In all their afflictions He was afflicted’; and none of us can ever meet a sorrow with whose face Christ was not familiar, and which He Himself has not conquered for us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. So that brings me to the next point suggested here, viz., our Lord’s varied, all-comprehensive sorrow was a necessity imposed upon Him by the purpose which He had in view.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The context gives us that assertion in distinct language. Adopting the improved and accurate rendering of the Revised Version of the previous verse, we read, ‘Verily not of angels doth He take hold, but He taketh hold of the seed of Abraham; wherefore in all things it behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now the word rendered here, ‘taketh hold,’ is the same word which is employed in the narrative of a very striking incident in the gospels, where the Apostle Peter is ready to sink in the water; and Jesus Christ ‘stretched forth His hand and caught him.’ And that story may serve as an illustration for us of the meaning of the writer here. Here we are all, the whole race of us, exposed to the pelting of the pitiless storm, and ready to sink beneath the waters, and Jesus Christ stretches forth His strong, gentle hand and lays hold of our tremulous and feeble fingers, and keeps us up above the surges which else would overwhelm us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, says my text, no man can help another unless he stand by the side of, and on the level of, that other. ‘He taketh hold, not of angels, but of the seed of Abraham’; and, therefore, He must have a hand like theirs, that can grasp theirs, and which theirs can grasp. Unless the Master had Himself been standing on the heaving surges, and Himself been subjected to the beating of the storm, He could not have revived and held up the sinking disciple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so our Lord’s bitter suffering, diffused through life and concentrated on the Cross, was no mere necessary result of His humanity, was not simply borne because, being a Teacher, He must stand to His principles whatever befell Him because of them; but it was a direct result of the purpose He had in view, that purpose being our redemption. Therefore to say, ‘It behoved Him to be made in all things like unto His brethren,’ is but to declare that Christ’s sufferings were no matter of physical necessity, but a matter of moral obligation. He must indeed suffer. But why must He? ‘It behoved Him to he made like unto His brethren’; but why was it obligatory upon Him so to take the bitter bread that we eat, and to drink the water of tears that we drink? For one reason, and for one reason only, because He loved us and willed to save us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So I beseech you to feel that underlying the bitter necessity which my text speaks about there is the voluntary endurance of Jesus Christ. Ah! we do not think enough about the necessity, all through His life, for a continual repetition of the great act of self-surrender of which His incarnation was the first consequence. At the beginning of His earthly career He emptied Himself, out of love to us; and step by step, and moment by moment, all through His life, there was the continual repetition of the same act. Each one of His sufferings was the direct result of His will at the moment to perfect the work which He came to do. At any instant He might have abandoned it; and that He did not was solely owing to His perennial love. For His own determination to save and succour us was the one cord that bound this sacrifice to the horns of the altar. The Man Christ, at every moment of His life, gave Himself; and as each fresh billow of sorrow rolled above His bowed and compliant head, it rolled because He still willed to save and help His fellows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This voluntary submission of our Lord to all the sufferings which befell Him because of His determination to come to the help of His brethren ought to make us feel how that whole life of His was one pure efflux of infinite and unspeakable love; and we ought to see in it the gift which ‘became’ the divine mercy indeed, but which also ‘behoved’ the Man Jesus, to the end that all our sorrows may be comforted and all our evil taken away.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We know not, nor ever can know, by what mysterious process the Son learned obedience by the things which He suffered, nor can we understand how it was that the High Priest, who would never have become the High Priest had He not been merciful, became yet more merciful by His own experience o£ human sorrow. But this we know, that somehow the pity, the sympathy of Christ, was deepened by His own life; and we can feel that it is easier for men to lay hold of His sympathy when they think of His sufferings, and to be sure that because in all points He was tempted like as we are, ‘He is able to succour them that are tempted.’ Comfort drops but coldly from lips that have never uttered a sigh or a groan; and for our poor human hearts it is not enough to have a merciful God far off in the heavens. We need a Christ who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ere we can come boldly to the Throne of Grace, assured of there finding grace in time of need.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, we have here the specification of the main purpose of our Lord’s sorrows - ‘that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things appertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That defines more closely what He has to do, if He is to help us, and what He does do when He takes hold of the seed of Abraham. There are but two remarks that I would make on this part of my subject. The one is - let us learn what is the true nature of Christ’s help. It is the help of a priest who comes to offer a sacrifice which takes away the burden and the guilt o£ sin from the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christ’s help is not merely the help of a wise Teacher. Men do not want only teaching. Their need goes far deeper than that. Christ’s help is not only the help of One who declares to His fellows what God is. Men’s needs go deeper than that. Christ’s help is not merely the help of One who sets forth in sweet attractive colours the beauty of holiness and the charm of purity. Men’s needs go deeper than that. We do not only need to know what God is, we need to have our relation to God altered. We do not only need to be told what we ought to do, we need that the past shall be cancelled, and the fatal bias and tendency towards evil within ourselves be taken away. Christ is not the Helper whose help goes down to the depths and the roots of men’s necessity, unless He is Priest as well as Prophet and King. He comes to do something as well as to say something; comes to alter our relations to God, as well as to declare God’s heart to us. In a word, we must say even to Christ, ‘Vain is Thy help, and impotent is Thy grasp, unless Thou dost bring by Thy sufferings reconciliation for the sins of the people.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And then, notice again how here we have Christ’s priestly office extended over His whole life of suffering. The popular representations of the gospel, and the superficial grasp of it which many good people have, are accustomed to draw a broad line of demarcation between Christ’s life and Christ’s death, and to concentrate the whole of the sacrificial and expiatory character of His work in His death only. My text goes in the other direction. It says that all that long-drawn sorrow which ran through the whole life of Jesus Christ, whilst it culminated in His death, was His sacrifice for the sins of the world. For all sorrow, according to scriptural teaching, is the fruit of sin; and the sinless Christ, who bore the sorrows which He had not earned, in bearing them bore them away.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And though the shell of them and the outward appearance of them may be left, the inward reality and the bitterness of them is gone. It is exactly in reference to the ills of life as it is in reference to the other penalty of sin which consists in death. The outward fact continues, the inward nature is altered. For he who can say, ‘Christ my Lord suffered for me,’ finds that sorrows become solemn joys, and all things work together for good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Cross is the climax of His sacrifice, but His whole life is sacrifice and expiation, because His whole life is the life of a sinless ‘Man of sorrows acquainted with grief.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, then, we have to look to Him, in all the meek endurance of His life, and in all the mysterious darkness of His death, not merely as the pattern of patience, as the Teacher of the sanctity of sorrow, as the first of the martyrs; but we have to look to Him, and to feel that ‘the Lord hath made to meet on Him the iniquity of us all.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Brother, He became like us in our sorrows that we might become like Him in His gladness. Each of us, singly, was in His mind and in His heart when He bowed Himself to the flood of sorrows, and yielded His soul to the Cross of shame. So let us stretch out our poor hands to Him who reaches His tender omnipotent one across the billows, and grasping the hands with the print of the nails, we shall find that we have exchanged portions, and that He who has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows has bestowed upon us His gladness, and crowned us with the glory of the blessedness which He had with the Father before the world was.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people....">Hebrews 2:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore in all things </span>— That essentially pertain to our nature, and in all sufferings and temptations; <span class="ital">it behooved him </span>— In respect of the office, duty, and employment he had taken upon him; or it was highly fit and proper, yea, necessary, in order to his design of redeeming them; <span class="ital">to be made like his brethren </span>— That is, a mortal man; <span class="ital">that </span>— By experience of suffering in himself; <span class="ital">he might be a merciful and faithful High-Priest </span>— <span class="ital">Merciful </span>toward sinners, affected with the sorrows and sufferings of others, and the more inclined to pity and relieve them; and <span class="ital">faithful </span>toward God, in discharging every other part of his office, as well as in relieving his suffering members.

Yet, considering the greatness of his nature, it might have been difficult for men to have understood this. And therefore, to impress us the more strongly with the belief that he is most affectionately disposed, from sympathy, to succour us when tempted; and, in judging us at the last day, to make every reasonable allowance for the infirmity of our nature, he was pleased to be made like us in all things, and even to suffer by temptations.” <span class="ital">In things pertaining to God </span>— That were to be done either for men with God, or for God with men; <span class="ital">to make reconciliation for </span>— Or <span class="ital">to expiate, </span>as <span class="greekheb">ιλασκεσθαι </span>signifies, <span class="ital">the sins of the people </span>— Not the people of the Jews merely, but the people of all nations, whether Jews or Gentiles, who, in repentance and faith, should turn to God.

Christ never designed to be the Saviour of the fallen angels, therefore he did not take their nature; and the nature of angels could not be an atoning sacrifice for the sin of man. Here is a price paid, enough for all, and suitable to all, for it was in our nature. Here the wonderful love of God appeared, that, when Christ knew what he must suffer in our nature, and how he must die in it, yet he readily took it upon him. And this atonement made way for his people's deliverance from Satan's bondage, and for the pardon of their sins through faith. Let those who dread death, and strive to get the better of their terrors, no longer attempt to outbrave or to stifle them, no longer grow careless or wicked through despair. Let them not expect help from the world, or human devices; but let them seek pardon, peace, grace, and a lively hope of heaven, by faith in Him who died and rose again, that thus they may rise above the fear of death. The remembrance of his own sorrows and temptations, makes Christ mindful of the trials of his people, and ready to help them. He is ready and willing to succour those who are tempted, and seek him. He became man, and was tempted, that he might be every way qualified to succour his people, seeing that he had passed through the same temptations himself, but continued perfectly free from sin. Then let not the afflicted and tempted despond, or give place to Satan, as if temptations made it wrong for them to come to the Lord in prayer. Not soul ever perished under temptation, that cried unto the Lord from real alarm at its danger, with faith and expectation of relief. This is our duty upon our first being surprised by temptations, and would stop their progress, which is our wisdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore in all things - In respect to his body; his soul; his rank and character. There was a propriety that he should be like them, and should partake of their nature. The meaning is, that there was a fitness that nothing should be wanting in him in reference to the innocent propensities and sympathies of human nature.<p>It behoved him - It became him; or there was a fitness and propriety in it. The reason why it was proper, the apostle proceeds to state.<p>Like unto his brethren - Like unto those who sustained to him the relation of brethren; particularly as he undertook to redeem the descendants of Abraham, and as he was a descendant of Abraham himself, there was a propriety that he should be like them. He calls them brethren; and it was proper that he should show that he regarded them as such by assuming their nature.<p>That he might be a merciful and faithful high priest - <p>(1) That he might be "merciful;" that is, compassionate. That he might know how to pity us in our infirmities and trials, by having a nature like our own.<p>(2) that he might be "faithful;" that is, perform with fidelity all the functions pertaining to the office of high priest. The idea is, that it was needful that he should become a man; that he should experience as we do the infirmities and trials of life, and that by being a man, and partaking of all that pertained to man except his sins, he might feel how necessary it was that there should be "fidelity" in the office of high priest. Here was a race of sinners and sufferers. They were exposed to the wrath of God. They were liable to everlasting punishment. The judgment impended over the race, and the day of vengeance hastened on. "All now depended on the great high priest." All their hope Was in his "fidelity" to the great office which he had undertaken. If he were faithful, all would be safe; if he were unfaithful, all would be lost. Hence, the necessity that he should enter fully into the feelings, fears, and dangers of man; that he should become one of the race and be identified with them, so that he might be qualified to perform with faithfulness the great trust committed to him.<p>High priest - The Jewish high priest was the successor of Aaron, and was at the head of the ministers of religion among the Jews. He was set apart with solemn ceremonies - clad in his sacred vestments - and anointed with oil; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-5.htm">Exodus 29:5-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a>. He was by his office the general judge of all that pertained to religion, and even of the judicial affairs of the Jewish nation; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-9.htm">Deuteronomy 33:9-10</a>.

The Lord Jesus became in the Christian dispensation what the Jewish high priest was in the old; and an important object of this Epistle is to show that he far surpassed the Jewish high priest, and in what respects the Jewish high priest was designed to typify the Redeemer. Paul, therefore, early introduces the subject, and shows that the Lord Jesus came to perform the functions of that sacred office, and that he was eminently endowed for it.<p>In things pertaining to God - In offering sacrifice; or in services of a religious nature.

The word used here - &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  hilaskomai - occurs but in one other place in the New Testament <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>, where it is rendered "God be merciful to me a sinner;" that is, reconciled to me. The noun (&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  hilasmos - "propitiation") is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>. The word here means properly to "appease," to reconcile, to conciliate; and hence, to "propitiate" as to "sins;" that is, to propitiate God in reference to sins, or to render him propitious. The Son of God became a man, that he might so fully enter into the feelings of the people as to be faithful, and that he might be qualified as a high priest to perform the great work of rendering God propitious in regard to sins. How he did this, is fully shown in the subsequent parts of the Epistle. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

He was actually made so, when He entered within the veil, from which last flows His ever continuing intercession as Priest for us.

Mercy is a prime requisite in a priest, since his office is to help the wretched and raise the fallen: such mercy is most likely to be found in one who has a fellow-feeling with the afflicted, having been so once Himself (Heb 4:15); not that the Son of God needed to be taught by suffering to be merciful, but that in order to save us He needed to take our manhood with all its sorrows, thereby qualifying Himself, by experimental suffering with us, to be our sympathizing High Priest, and assuring us of His entire fellow-feeling with us in every sorrow. So in the main Calvin remarks here.<p>faithful&#8212;true to God (Heb 3:5, 6) and to man (Heb 10:23) in the mediatorial office which He has undertaken.<p>high priest&#8212;which Moses was not, though "faithful" (Heb 2:1-18). Nowhere, except in Ps 110:4; Zec 6:13, and in this Epistle, is Christ expressly called a priest. In this Epistle alone His priesthood is professedly discussed; whence it is evident how necessary is this book of the New Testament. In Ps 110:1-7, and Zec 6:13, there is added mention of the kingdom of Christ, which elsewhere is spoken of without the priesthood, and that frequently. On the cross, whereon as Priest He offered the sacrifice, He had the title "King" inscribed over Him [Bengel].<p>to make reconciliation for the sins&#8212;rather as Greek, "to propitiate (in respect to) the sins"; "to expiate the sins." Strictly divine justice is "propitiated"; but God's love is as much from everlasting as His justice; therefore, lest Christ's sacrifice, or its typical forerunners, the legal sacrifices, should be thought to be antecedent to God's grace and love, neither are said in the Old or New Testament to have propitiated God; otherwise Christ's sacrifices might have been thought to have first induced God to love and pity man, instead of (as the fact really is) His love having originated Christ's sacrifice, whereby divine justice and divine love are harmonized. The sinner is brought by that sacrifice into God's favor, which by sin he had forfeited; hence his right prayer is, "God be propitiated (so the Greek) to me who am a sinner" (Lu 18:13). Sins bring death and "the fear of death" (Heb 2:15). He had no sin Himself, and "made reconciliation for the iniquity" of all others (Da 9:24).<p>of the people&#8212;"the seed of Abraham" (Heb 2:16); the literal Israel first, and then (in the design of God), through Israel, the believing Gentiles, the spiritual Israel (1Pe 2:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It behoved him:</span> the last reason why God the Son assumed and united the human nature in the seed of Abraham to his person, and was by it made like his brethren, and for a little while lower than the angels, was, that he might be capable to receive and execute the office of priesthood, by which reconciliation of sinners to God was to be effected: for he could neither be a sacrifice nor priest without it. ’ Wfeile signifies not only its being necessary, but becoming, meet, convenient, and right, both on the account of his mediatorship, suretiship, priesthood, and of his very work, considering the two parties whose cause he was to manage.

The adopted sons of God, who were brethren before Christ's incarnation, being from all eternity predestinated to the adoption of children: Christ's incarnation was in time, and after that many of the brethren existed; and it was only for their sakes that he assumed human nature; and therefore it was proper he should be like them in that nature, in all things: in all the essentials of it; it was not necessary that he should have it by natural generation; nor that it should have a subsistence in itself as theirs: and in all the properties and affections of it, that are, not sinful; for it did not behove him to be like them in sin, nor in sickness, and in diseases of the body: and in all temptations; though in some things his differ from theirs; none of his arose from within; and those from without could make no impression on him: and in sufferings, that there might be a conformity between the head and members; though there is in some things a difference; his sufferings were by way of punishment, and were attended with wrath, and were meritorious, which cannot be said of theirs; but that he should have an human nature, as to its essence and perfection, like to theirs, was necessary: it was proper he should be truly and really man, as well as truly God, <p>that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest; he could not be an high priest, offer sacrifice for sin, and make intercession, unless he was man; nor could he be a "merciful" and compassionate one, sympathize with his people in their sorrows, temptations, and sufferings, unless he was like them in these; nor would he be a "faithful", that is, a true and lawful one otherwise, because every high priest is taken from among men: <p>in things pertaining to God; in things in which God has to do with his people, as to preside in his name over them, to declare his will unto them, and bless them; and in things in which the people have to do with God, to offer to God a sacrifice for their sins, to present this sacrifice to him, to appear in his presence for them, to carry in their petitions, and plead their cause as their advocate: <p>to make reconciliation for the sins of the people; of God's covenant people, the people he has chosen for himself, and given to his Son; and whom Christ saves from their sins, by making satisfaction for them, to the law and justice of God, which is here meant by reconciliation: and in order to this, which could not be done without blood, without sufferings and death, it was proper he should be man, and like unto his brethren: the allusion seems to be to the two goats on the day of atonement, one of which was to be slain, and the other let go; which were to be, as the Jews say (p),  "alike", in colour, in stature, and in price; and so were the birds to be alike in the same things, that were used at the cleansing of the leper (q): and the Jews tell us (r), that the high priest was to be greater than his brethren, in beauty, in strength, in wisdom, and in riches; all which is true of Christ. <p>(p) Misna Yoma, c. 6. sect. 1.((q) Misna Negaim, c. 14. sect. 5.

But the polemic against readers who thought they could not dispense with the ritual of the Jewish sacrifice of atonement for the attainment of salvation, naturally led him to insist with emphasis on the superiority of Christ as the heavenly High Priest over the Jewish high priests as the merely earthly ones. Since now, on the other side, it is equally undeniable that the author places the voluntary sacrificial death of Christ, and the entering with His blood into the heavenly Holy of Holies,—as the two inseparable acts of the same proceeding,—in parallel with the slaying of the sacrificial victim, and the entering of the earthly high priest with the sacrificial blood into the earthly Holy of Holies, and looks upon the sins of men as completely expiated by the sacrificial death of Christ itself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;...">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm" title="Why Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.">Hebrews 13:12</a>), there can be no room for doubt, that according to the mind of our author the investiture of Christ with the high-priestly dignity had already begun on earth, from the time of His death; and the representation of mankind in the presence of God is to be thought of as the continued administration of the high-priestly office already entered upon. So in substance also Riehm (comp. the detailed discussion by this writer, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 466–481); although it is certainly not in accordance with the view of the writer of the epistle, when Riehm afterwards (like Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 63 f., 2 Aufl.) supposes a distinction is to be made between Christ as <span class="ital">High Priest</span> and Christ as <span class="ital">High Priest after the manner of Melchisedec</span>, in that he represents Christ as having become the former by virtue of that which He did during the days of His flesh, as well as on His entrance into the heavenly Holy of Holies, and the latter only by virtue of His exaltation to God, where He ever liveth to make intercession for us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅθεν</span> [six times in this Epistle; not used by Paul, but <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-19.htm" title="Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:">Acts 26:19</a>] ‘wherefore,’ because He makes the seed of Abraham the object of His saving work, <span class="greekheb">ὤφειλεν</span>, “He was under obligation”. <span class="greekheb">ὀφείλω</span> is “used of a necessity imposed either by law and duty, or by reason, or by the times, or by the nature of the matter under consideration” (Thayer). Here it was the nature of the case which imposed the obligation <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πάντα τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ὁμοιωθῆναι</span> “to be made like His brothers in all respects,” and therefore, as Chrysostom says, <span class="greekheb">ἐτέχθη</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐτράφη</span>, <span class="greekheb">ηὐξήθη</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔπαθε πάντα ἅπερ ἐχρῆν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τέλος ἀπέθανη</span>. He must be a real man, and not merely have the appearance of one. He must enter into the necessary human experiences, look at things from the human point of view, take His place in the crowd amidst the ordinary elements of life. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> introduces one purpose which this thorough incarnation was to serve. It would put Christ in a position to sympathise with the tempted and thus incline Him to make propitiation for the sins of the people. [<span class="greekheb">τοῦ λαοῦ</span>, also a restricted Jewish designation.] The High-Priesthood is here first mentioned, and it is mentioned as an office with which the readers were familiar. The writer does not now enlarge upon the office or work of the Priest, but merely points to one radical necessity imposed by priesthood, “making propitiation for the sins of the people”; and he affirms that in order to do this (<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ</span>) he must be merciful and faithful. <span class="greekheb">ἐλεήμων</span> as well as <span class="greekheb">πιστὸς</span> is naturally construed with <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεὺς</span>, and has its root in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-27.htm" title="For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he cries to me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.">Exodus 22:27</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐλεήμων γάρ εἰμι</span>, the priest must represent the Divine mercy; he must also be <span class="greekheb">πιστὸς</span>, primarily to God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>, but thereby faithful to men and to be trusted by them in the region in which he exercises his function, <span class="greekheb">τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεόν</span>, the whole Godward relations of men. The expression is directly connected with <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεὺς</span>, by implication with <span class="greekheb">πιστὸς</span>, and it is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm" title="Listen now to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God shall be with you: Be you for the people to God-ward, that you may bring the causes to God:">Exodus 18:19</a>, <span class="greekheb">γίνου σὺ τῷ λαῷ τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν</span>. For neat analogies <span class="ital">cf.</span> Wetstein. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ἱλάσκεσθαι</span>, “for the purpose of making propitiation,” <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> indicating the special purpose to be served by Christ’s becoming Priest. <span class="greekheb">ἱλάσκομαι</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἱλάσκω</span> is not met with), from <span class="greekheb">ἵλαος</span>, Attic <span class="greekheb">ἵλεως</span> “propitious,” “merciful,” means “I render propitious to myself”. In the classics it is followed by the accusative of the person propitiated, sometimes of the anger felt. In the LXX it occurs twelve times, thrice as the translation of <span class="greekheb">כִּפֵּר</span>. The only instance in which it is followed by an accusative of the sin, as here, is Psalms 64 (65):3, <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἀσεβείας ἡμῶν σὺ ἱλάσῃ</span>. In the N.T., besides the present passage, it only occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>, in the passive form <span class="greekheb">ἱλάσθητί μοι τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm" title="In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.">2 Kings 5:18</a>. The compound form <span class="greekheb">ἐξιλάσκομαι</span>, although it does not occur in N.T., is more frequently used in the LXX than the simple verb, and from its construction something may be learnt. As in profane Greek, it is followed by an accusative of the person propitiated, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-20.htm" title="And say you moreover, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.">Genesis 32:20</a>, where Jacob says of Esau <span class="greekheb">ἐξιλάσομαι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς δώροις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-2.htm" title="When they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,">Zechariah 7:2</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξιλάσασθαι τὸν Κύριον</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-22.htm" title="Yes, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.">Zechariah 8:22</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ πρόσωπον Κυρίου</span>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-9.htm" title="And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;">Matthew 1:9</a>. It is however also followed by an accusative of the thing on account of which propitiation is needed or which requires by some rite or process to be rendered acceptable to God, as in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/3-3.htm" title="Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins:">Sir 3:3</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/3-30.htm" title="Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins.">Sir 3:30</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/5-6.htm" title="And say not His mercy is great; he will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him, and his indignation resteth upon sinners.">Sir 5:6</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/20-28.htm" title="He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity.">Sir 20:28</a>, etc., where it is followed by <span class="greekheb">ἀδικίαν</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας</span>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm" title="And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remains among them in the middle of their uncleanness.">Leviticus 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-20.htm" title="And when he has made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:">Leviticus 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-33.htm" title="And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.">Leviticus 16:33</a>, where it is followed by <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἅγιον</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ θυσιαστήριον</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-20.htm" title="And so you shall do the seventh day of the month for every one that errs, and for him that is simple: so shall you reconcile the house.">Ezekiel 45:20</a> by <span class="greekheb">τὸν οἶκον</span>. At least thirty-two times in Leviticus alone it is followed by <span class="greekheb">περί</span>, defining the persons for whom propitiation is made, <span class="greekheb">περὶ αὐτοῦ ἐξιλάσεται ὁ ἱερεύς</span> or <span class="greekheb">περὶ πάσης συναγωγῆς</span>, or <span class="greekheb">περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν</span>. In this usage there is apparent a transition from the idea of propitiating God (which still survives in the passive <span class="greekheb">ἱλάσθητι</span>) to the idea of exerting some influence on that which was offensive to God and which must be removed or cleansed in order to complete entrance into His favour. In the present passage it is <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἁμαρτίας τοῦ λαοῦ</span> which stand in the way of the full expression of God’s favour, and upon those therefore the propitiatory influence of Christ is to be exerted. In what manner precisely this is to be accomplished is not yet said. “The present infinitive <span class="greekheb">ἱλάσκεσθαι</span> must be noticed. The one (eternal) act of Christ (c. x. 12–14) is here regarded in its continuous present application to men (<span class="ital">cf.</span> c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-1.htm" title="Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip....">Hebrews 2:1-2</a>),” Westcott.

In Christ “mercy and truth” have met together. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm" title="Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.">Psalm 85:10</a>. The expression “a faithful priest” is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-35.htm" title="And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.">1 Samuel 2:35</a>. Dr Robertson Smith well points out that the idea of “a <span class="bld">merciful</span> priest,” which is scarcely to be found in the O.T., would come home with peculiar force to the Jews of that day, because mercy was a quality in which the Aaronic Priests had signally failed (<span class="ital">Yoma</span>, f. 9. 1), and in the Herodian epoch they were notorious for cruelty, insolence and greed (see my <span class="ital">Life of Christ</span>, ii. 329, 330). The Jews said that there had been no less than 28 High Priests in 107 years of this epoch (Jos. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xx. 10) their brief dignity being due to their wickedness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-27.htm" title="The fear of the LORD prolongs days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.">Proverbs 10:27</a>). The conception of the Priesthood hitherto had been ceremonial rather than ethical; yet it is only “by mercy and truth” that “iniquity is purged.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm" title="By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.">Proverbs 16:6</a>. The word “High Priest,” here first introduced, has evidently been entering into the writer’s thoughts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm" title="For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.">Hebrews 2:16</a>), and is the most prominent conception throughout the remainder of the Epistle. The consummating steps in genuine high priesthood are touched upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-10.htm" title="Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">high priest</span>] The Greek word is comparatively new. In the Pentateuch the high priest is merely called “the Priest” (except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10</a>). In later books of Scripture the epithet “head” or “great” is added. The word occurs 17 times in this Epistle, but not once in any other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in things pertaining to God</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1</a>. The phrase is found in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm" title="Listen now to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God shall be with you: Be you for the people to God-ward, that you may bring the causes to God:">Exodus 18:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to make reconciliation for the sins of the people</span>] More literally, “to expiate the sins of the people.” Christ is nowhere said in the N. T. to “expiate” or “propitiate” God or “the wrath of God” (which are heathen, not Christian, conceptions), nor is any such expression found in the LXX. Nor do we find such phrases as “God was propitiated by the death of His Son,” or “Christ propitiated the wrath of God by His blood.” God Himself fore-ordained the propitiation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>). The verb represents the Hebrew <span class="ital">kippeer</span>, “to cover,” whence is derived the name for the day of Atonement (<span class="ital">Kippurim</span>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a> Theodotion’s version has <span class="greekheb">ἐξιλάσαθαι ἀδικίας</span>. We are left to unauthorised theory and conjecture as to the <span class="ital">manner in which</span> and the <span class="ital">reason for which</span> “expiation,” in the form of “sacrifice,” interposes between “sin” and “wrath.” All we know is that, <span class="ital">in relation to us</span>, Christ is “the propitiation for our sins” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1 John 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>).

HE WAS CALLED <span class="ital">a High Priest</span> at the time when He was made perfect; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-10.htm" title="Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:10</a>. III. He was MADE High Priest when He entered into that which is within the veil; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>; and when this entrance was made once for all, He always, as a Priest for us, presents Himself before the face of God; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐλεήμων</span>, <span class="ital">merciful</span>) This word, as well as <span class="greekheb">πιστὸς</span>, <span class="ital">faithful</span>, is construed with <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεὺς</span>, <span class="ital">high priest;</span> ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-2.htm" title="Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.">Hebrews 5:2</a>. He was made <span class="ital">merciful</span> to the <span class="ital">people</span> labouring under sins: <span class="greekheb">πιστὸς</span>, <span class="ital">faithful</span>, so far as GOD is concerned. There is a Chiasmus here.[22] We have the <span class="ital">Priest</span> and the <span class="ital">High Priest</span>, who has the right of drawing near and of bringing men to God. The word <span class="ital">faithful</span> is treated of, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>, with the addition of the practical application: the word <span class="greekheb">ἐλεήμων</span>, <span class="ital">merciful</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>, etc., with the practical application also added: the word <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεὺς</span>, <span class="ital">High Priest</span>, is treated of, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-4.htm" title="And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron....">Hebrews 5:4-5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;...">Hebrews 7:1-2</a>, with the practical application added, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>. The proposition or statement of many things at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a> (where see the note), very much resembles this. Of these three points, one, <span class="greekheb">ἐλεήμων</span>, <span class="ital">merciful</span>, is put before <span class="greekheb">γένηται</span>, that <span class="ital">He might become</span>, because it is deduced from what was previously said. The other two are properly connected together, because they come to be treated of afterwards along with the first. But the word <span class="ital">merciful</span>, and, conjointly with it, <span class="ital">faithful High Priest</span>, elegantly have in this proposition a rather absolute signification, because again (in turn) the subsequent discussion contemplates <span class="ital">faithfulness</span> without <span class="ital">the priesthood</span> in the case of Moses, and <span class="ital">mercy</span> with the <span class="ital">priesthood</span> in the case of Aaron. First, Jesus is <span class="ital">merciful</span>. No one can suppose that Jesus had more mercy before He suffered, and that now He has more severity. Only let us now flee (escape) from the wrath of the Lamb, which is even yet to come.—<span class="greekheb">Ἀρχιερεὺς</span>) <span class="ital">High Priest</span>. The Latin <span class="ital">Pontifex</span> was so called from the fact, that he <span class="ital">built a</span> <span class="ital">bridge</span> at Rome, or <span class="ital">sacrificed</span> on a <span class="ital">bridge;</span> and the <span class="ital">pontifex</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἱερεὺς</span>, was either alone or with others; but the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΡΧΙΕΡΕῪς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">high priest</span> (<span class="ital">pontifex maximus</span>), was exalted above the others, over whom he presided. In the Evangelists and Acts, where the Jewish <span class="ital">high priests</span> are frequently mentioned, the term <span class="ital">pontiff</span> (<span class="ital">pontifex</span>), used by the Vulgate and other translations, will not, I think, offend any one; but in this epistle, in which Christ is the principal subject, I do not know whether that term may be as well suited to the style of Paul as to the institutions of Numa. At least Seb. Schmidius uses it with reluctance, and occasionally substitutes for it <span class="ital">chief priest</span> (<span class="ital">princeps sacerdos</span>); but a single word is better, especially when other epithets are added, as here <span class="ital">merciful</span> and <span class="ital">faithful;</span> for we cannot conveniently say, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>, <span class="ital">a great chief</span> (greatest) <span class="ital">pontiff</span> (<span class="ital">pontificem maximum magnum</span>). <span class="ital">High priest</span> (<span class="ital">archisacerdos</span>) is the most convenient term which the learned have long used, and which sounds as well as <span class="ital">archigubernus</span>, in the writings of Jabolenus, <span class="ital">archiflamen, archipræsul, archipontifex</span>, and various other terms, which Vossius stigmatizes in his work, De vitiis Latini Sermonis, p. 371, and some other writers. With respect to the subject now before us, this glorious title of <span class="ital">High Priest</span> occurs presently again, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>. But nowhere, except in the 110th Psalm, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-13.htm" title="Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.">Zechariah 6:13</a>, and in this epistle, is Christ expressly called a <span class="ital">Priest;</span> and it is only in this epistle that the priesthood of Christ is professedly discussed. Whence it is evident, how extraordinary in its character, and how necessary, is this book of the New Testament. However, in all these passages, which are even of the Old Testament, there is added the mention of the <span class="ital">kingdom</span>, which is oftener spoken of elsewhere without the priesthood. Nay, on the Cross, on which this Priest offered His sacrifice, He had the title (inscription) of <span class="ital">King</span>. The priesthood, as well as the kingdom, is appropriate (belongs fittingly) to this First-begotten.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν</span>, <span class="ital">towards God</span>) So ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ἱλάσκεσθαι</span>) <span class="ital">to make atonement</span> or <span class="ital">reconciliation</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τὰς ἁμαρτίας</span>, <span class="ital">the sins</span>) which bring death and the fear of it.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ λαοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">of the people</span>) <span class="ital">the people</span>, whom he called the <span class="ital">seed of Abraham</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm" title="For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.">Hebrews 2:16</a>.

The keynote of the Epistle, the high-priesthood of Christ, which is intimated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, is here for the first time distinctly struck. Having shown that Christ delivers from the fear of death by nullifying the accusing power of sin, he now shows that he does this in his capacity of high priest, for which office it was necessary that he should be made like unto his human brethren. In the O.T. economy, the fear of death was especially connected with the approach to God of an impure worshipper (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-3.htm">Numbers 18:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-5.htm">Numbers 18:5</a>). This fear was mitigated or removed by the intervention of the Levitical priest, since it was the special charge of the priest so to discharge the service of the tabernacle that there might be no outbreak of divine wrath on the children of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-5.htm">Numbers 18:5</a>).&#x393;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; might show himself to be, or prove to be. The idea of compassion as an attribute of priests is not found in the O.T. On the contrary, the fault of the priests was their frequent lack of sympathy with the people (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-4.htm">Hosea 4:4-9</a>). In the later Jewish history, and in N.T. times, the priestly aristocracy of the Sadducees was notoriously unfeeling and cruel. The idea of a compassionate and faithful high priest would appeal powerfully to Jewish readers, who knew the deficiency of the Aaronic priesthood in that particular. &#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; faithful, as an attribute of a priest, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>.
