Christ never designed to be the Saviour of the fallen angels, therefore he did not take their nature; and the nature of angels could not be an atoning sacrifice for the sin of man. Here is a price paid, enough for all, and suitable to all, for it was in our nature. Here the wonderful love of God appeared, that, when Christ knew what he must suffer in our nature, and how he must die in it, yet he readily took it upon him. And this atonement made way for his people's deliverance from Satan's bondage, and for the pardon of their sins through faith. Let those who dread death, and strive to get the better of their terrors, no longer attempt to outbrave or to stifle them, no longer grow careless or wicked through despair. Let them not expect help from the world, or human devices; but let them seek pardon, peace, grace, and a lively hope of heaven, by faith in Him who died and rose again, that thus they may rise above the fear of death. The remembrance of his own sorrows and temptations, makes Christ mindful of the trials of his people, and ready to help them. He is ready and willing to succour those who are tempted, and seek him. He became man, and was tempted, that he might be every way qualified to succour his people, seeing that he had passed through the same temptations himself, but continued perfectly free from sin. Then let not the afflicted and tempted despond, or give place to Satan, as if temptations made it wrong for them to come to the Lord in prayer. Not soul ever perished under temptation, that cried unto the Lord from real alarm at its danger, with faith and expectation of relief. This is our duty upon our first being surprised by temptations, and would stop their progress, which is our wisdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forasmuch then - Since; or because.<p>As the children - Those who were to become the adopted children of God; or who were to sustain that relation to him.<p>Are partakers of flesh and blood - Have a human and not an angelic nature. Since they are men, he became a man. There was a fitness or propriety that he should partake of their nature; see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a> note.<p>He also himself, ... - He also became a man, or partook of the same nature with them; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p>That through death - By dying. It is implied here:<p>(1) that the work which he undertook of destroying him that had the power of death, was to be accomplished by "his own dying;" and,<p>(2) that in order to this, it was necessary that he should be a man. An angel does not die, and therefore he did not take on him the nature of angels; and the Son of God in his divine nature could not die, and therefore he assumed a form in which he could die - that of a man. In that nature the Son of God could taste of death; and thus he could destroy him that had the power of death.<p>He might destroy - That he might "subdue," or that he might overcome him, and "destroy" his dominion. The word "destroy" here is not used in the sense of "closing life," or of "killing," but in the sense of bringing into subjection, or crushing his power. This is the work which the Lord Jesus came to perform - to destroy the kingdom of Satan in the world, and to set up another kingdom in its place. This was understood by Satan to be his object: see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a> note.<p>That had the power of death - I understand this as meaning that the devil was the cause of death in this world. He was the means of its introduction, and of its long and melancholy reign. This does not "affirm" anything of his power of inflicting death in particular instances - whatever may be true on that point - but that "death" was a part of his dominion; that he introduced it; that he seduced man from God, and led on the train of woes which result in death. He also made it terrible. Instead of being regarded as falling asleep, or being looked on without alarm, it becomes under him the means of terror and distress. What "power" Satan may have in inflicting death in particular instances no one can tell. The Jewish Rabbis speak much of Sammael, "the angel of death" -  &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;  mal'aak hamuwt - who they supposed had the control of life, and was the great messenger employed in closing it.<p>The Scriptures, it is believed, are silent on that point. But that Satan was the means of introducing "death into the world, and all our woe," no one can doubt; and over the whole subject, therefore, he may be said to have had power. To "destroy" that dominion: to rescue man; to restore him to life; to place him in a world where death is unknown; to introduce a state of things where "not another one would ever die," was the great purpose for which the Redeemer came. What a noble object! What enterprise in the universe has been so grand and noble as this! Surely an undertaking that contemplates the annihilation of death; that designs to bring this dark dominion to an end, is full of benevolence, and commends itself to every man as worthy of his profound attention and gratitude. What woes are caused by death in this world! They are seen everywhere. The earth is "arched with graves." In almost every dwelling death has been doing his work of misery. The palace cannot exclude him; and he comes unbidden into the cottage. He finds his way to the dwelling of ice in which the Esquimaux and the Greenlander live; to the tent of the Bedouin Arab, and the wandering Tartar; to the wigwam of the Indian, and to the harem of the Turk; to the splendid mansion of the rich, as well as to the abode of the poor. That reign of death has now extended near 6,000 years, and will travel on to future times - meeting each generation, and consigning the young, the vigorous, the lovely, and the pure, to dust. Shall that gloomy reign continue forever? Is there no way to arrest it? Is there no place where death can be excluded? Yes: heaven - and the object of the Redeemer is to bring us there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. He who has thus been shown to be the "Captain (Greek, 'Leader') of salvation" to the "many sons," by trusting and suffering like them, must therefore become man like them, in order that His death may be efficacious for them [Alford].<p>the children&#8212;before mentioned (Heb 2:13); those existing in His eternal purpose, though not in actual being.<p>are partakers of&#8212;literally, "have (in His purpose) been partakers" all in common.<p>flesh and blood&#8212;Greek oldest manuscripts have "blood and flesh." The inner and more important element, the blood, as the more immediate vehicle of the soul, stands before the more palpable element, the flesh; also, with reference to Christ's blood-shedding with a view to which He entered into community with our corporeal life. "The life of the flesh is in the blood; it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul" (Le 17:11, 14).<p>also&#8212;Greek, "in a somewhat similar manner"; not altogether in a like manner. For He, unlike them, was conceived and born not in sin (Heb 4:15). But mainly "in like manner"; not in mere semblance of a body, as the Docet&aelig; heretics taught.<p>took part of&#8212;participated in. The forfeited inheritance (according to Jewish law) was ransomed by the nearest of kin; so Jesus became our nearest of kin by His assumed humanity, in order to be our Redeemer.<p>that through death&#8212;which He could not have undergone as God but only by becoming man. Not by Almighty power but by His death (so the Greek) He overcame death. "Jesus suffering death overcame; Satan wielding death succumbed" [Bengel]. As David cut off the head of Goliath with the giant's own sword wherewith the latter was wont to win his victories. Coming to redeem mankind, Christ made Himself a sort of hook to destroy the devil; for in Him there was His humanity to attract the devourer to Him, His divinity to pierce him, apparent weakness to provoke, hidden power to transfix the hungry ravisher. The Latin epigram says, Mors mortis morti mortem nisi morte tu lisset, &AElig;tern&aelig; vit&aelig; janua clausa foret. "Had not death by death borne to death the death of Death, the gate of eternal life would have been closed".<p>destroy&#8212;literally, "render powerless"; deprive of all power to hurt His people. "That thou mightest still the enemy and avenger" (Ps 8:2). The same Greek verb is used in 2Ti 1:10, "abolished death." There is no more death for believers. Christ plants in them an undying seed, the germ of heavenly immortality, though believers have to pass through natural death.<p>power&#8212;Satan is "strong" (Mt 12:29).<p>of death&#8212;implying that death itself is a power which, though originally foreign to human nature, now reigns over it (Ro 5:12; 6:9). The power which death has Satan wields. The author of sin is the author of its consequences. Compare "power of the enemy" (Lu 10:19). Satan has acquired over man (by God's law, Ge 2:17; Ro 6:23) the power of death by man's sin, death being the executioner of sin, and man being Satan's "lawful captive." Jesus, by dying, has made the dying His own (Ro 14:9), and has taken the prey from the mighty. Death's power was manifest; he who wielded that power, lurking beneath it, is here expressed, namely, Satan.

By the children are meant, not the children of this world, or the men of it; nor the children of the flesh, or Abraham's natural seed; nor visible professors of religion; nor the apostles of Christ only; but all the children of God, the children given to Christ; all the sons that are brought to glory: these "are partakers of flesh and blood"; of human nature, which is common to them all, and which is subject to infirmity and mortality; and the sense is, that they are frail mortal men: and this being their state and case, <p>he also himself took part of the same; Christ became man also, or assumed an human nature like theirs; this shows that he existed before his incarnation, who of himself, and by his own voluntary act, assumed an individual of human nature into union with his divine person, which is expressive of wondrous grace and condescension: Christ's participation of human nature, and the children's, in some things agree, in others they differ; they agree in this, that it is real flesh and blood they both partake of; that Christ's body is not spiritual and heavenly, but natural as theirs is; and that it is a complete, perfect, human nature, and subject to mortality and infirmity like theirs: but then Christ took his nature of a virgin, and is without sin; nor has it any distinct personality, but from the moment of its being subsisted in his divine person: and now the true reason of Christ's assuming such a nature was on account of the children, which discovers great love to them, and shows that it was with a peculiar view to them that he became man; hence they only share the special advantages of his incarnation, sufferings, and death: and his end in doing this was, <p>that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; the devil is said to have the power of death, not because he can kill and destroy men at pleasure, but because he was the first introducer of sin, which brought death into the world, and so he was a murderer from the beginning; and he still tempts men to sin, and then accuses them of it, and terrifies and affrights them with death; and by divine permission has inflicted it, and will be the executioner of the second death. The apostle here speaks in the language of the Jews, who often call Samael, or Satan, , "the angel of death", in their Targums (k), Talmud (l), and other writings (m); and say, he was the cause of death to all the world; and ascribe much the same things to him, for which the apostle here so styles him: and they moreover say (n), that he will cease in the time to come; that is, in the days of the Messiah: and who being come, has destroyed him, not as to his being, but as to his power; he has bruised his head, destroyed his works, disarmed his principalities and powers, and took the captives out of his hands, and saved those he would have devoured: and this he has done by death; "by his own death", as the Syriac and Arabic versions read; whereby he has abolished death itself, and sin the cause of it, and so Satan, whose empire is supported by it. <p>(k) Targum Jon. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.6. &amp; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3.htm">Habakkuk 3</a>.5.

This saving brotherhood involved incarnation and death. For, as it has ever been the common lot of the <span class="greekheb">παιδία</span> to live under the conditions imposed by flesh and blood, subject to inevitable dissolution and the shrinkings and weaknesses consequent, He also, this Son of God, Himself (<span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτὸς</span>) shared with them in their identical nature, thus making Himself liable to death; His intention being that by dying He might render harmless him that used death as a terror, and thus deliver from slavery those who had suffered death to rule their life and lived in perpetual dread. <span class="greekheb">κεκοινώνηκεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">μετέσχεν</span> perf. and aor.; the one pointing to the common lot which the <span class="greekheb">παιδία</span> have always shared, <span class="greekheb">αἵματος καὶ σαρκός</span>, usually (but not always, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>) inverted and denoting human nature in its weakness and liability to decay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>, etc., and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>); the other, expressing the one act of Christ by which He became a sharer with men in this weak condition. He partook, but does not now partake. [Wetstein quotes from Polyaenus that Chabrias enjoined upon his soldiers when about to engage in battle to think of the enemy as <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώποις αἷμα καὶ σάρκα ἔχουσιν καὶ τῆς αὐτῆς φύσεως ἡμῖν κεκοινωνηκόσι</span>.] This human nature Christ assumed <span class="greekheb">παραπλησίως</span>, which Chrysostom interprets, <span class="greekheb">οὐ φαντασίᾳ οὐδὲ εἰκόνι ἀλλʼ ἀληθείᾳ</span>. It means not merely “in like manner,” but “in absolutely the same manner”; as in Arrian vii. 1, 9, <span class="greekheb">σὺ δὲ ἄνθρωπος ὢν</span>, <span class="greekheb">παραπλήσιος τοῖς ἄλλοις</span>, Herod. 3:104, <span class="greekheb">σχεδὸν παραπλησίως</span> “almost identical”; see also Diod. Sic., ver. 45. <span class="greekheb">τῶν αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, blood and flesh. The purpose of the incarnation is expressed in the words <span class="greekheb">ἵνα διὰ τοῦ f1θανάτου</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἦσαν δουλίας</span>. He took flesh that He might die, and so destroy not death but him that had the power of death, and deliver, etc. The double object may be considered as one, the defeat of the devil involving the deliverance of those in bondage. The means He used to accomplish this object was His dying (<span class="greekheb">διὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θανάτου</span>). How the death of Christ had the result here ascribed to it, we are left to conjecture; for nowhere else in the Epistle is the deliverance of man by Christ’s death stated in analogous terms. We must first endeavour to understand the terms here employed. <span class="greekheb">καταργήσῃ</span>: “might render inoperative” (<span class="greekheb">ἄεργον</span>), “bring to nought”. Sometimes “destroy” or “put an end to” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm" title="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.">1 Corinthians 15:26</a> <span class="greekheb">ἔσχατος ἐχθρὸς καταργεῖται ὁ θάνατος</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸν τὸ κράτος ἔχοντα τοῦ θανάτου</span>, “him who has the power of death, that is, the devil,” <span class="greekheb">τὸν διάβολον</span> (<span class="greekheb">διαβάλλω</span>, I set asunder, put at variance) used by LXX to render <span class="greekheb">שֳׂטָן</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-2.htm" title="And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.">Job 1:2</a> and Zach. 3, etc.; <span class="greekheb">Σατάν</span> is used in 1 Kings 11. In N.T. both designations occur frequently. But the significance for our present passage lies in the description “him who has the power of death”. <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν τὸ κράτος</span> is classical, and <span class="greekheb">κράτος</span> with the genitive denotes the realm within which or over which the rule is exercised, as Herod., iii. 142, <span class="greekheb">τῆς Σάμου τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κράτος</span>. In connection with this universal human experience of death he uses his malign influence, and the striking vision of Zechariah 3 shows us how he does so. He brings sins to remembrance, he appears as the accuser of the brethren, as the counsel for the prosecution. Thus he creates a fear of death, a fear which is one of the most marked features of O.T. experience. Both Schoettgen and Weber produce rabbinical sayings which illustrate the power of a legal religion to produce servility and fear, so that the natural expression of the Jew was, “In this life death will not suffer a man to be glad”. Life, in short, with sin unaccounted for, and with death viewed as the punishment of sin to look forward to, is a <span class="greekheb">δουλεία</span> unworthy of God’s sons. This indeed is expressly stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-15.htm" title="And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.">Hebrews 2:15</a>. The <span class="greekheb">δουλεία</span> which contradicts the idea of sonship and prevents men from entering upon their destiny of dominion over all things is occasioned by their fear of death (<span class="greekheb">φόβῳ</span>, the dative of cause) as that which implies rejection by God. [Among the races whose conscience was not educated by the law, views of death varied greatly. These will be found in Geddes’ <span class="ital">Phaedo</span>, pp. 217, 223; and <span class="ital">cf.</span> the opening paragraphs of the third Book of the <span class="ital">Republic</span>, as well as pp. 330 and 486 B. Aristotle with his usual straightforward frankness pronounces death <span class="greekheb">φοβερώτατον</span>. On the other hand, many believed <span class="greekheb">τεθνάμεναι βέλτιον ἢ βίοτος</span>; Hegesias was styled <span class="greekheb">ὁ πεισιθάνατος</span>, and by his persuasions and otherwise suicide became popular; and death was no longer reckoned an everlasting ill, but “portum potius paratum nobis et perfugium”. Wholly applicable to the present passage is Spinoza’s “homo <span class="ital">liber</span> de nihilo minus quam de morte cogitat”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Philo, <span class="ital">Omn. sap. liber</span>, who quotes Eurip., <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐστι δοῦλος τοῦ θανεῖν ἄφροντις ὤν</span>;] This then was the bondage which characterised the life (<span class="greekheb">διὰ παντὸς τοῦ ζῆν</span>) of those under the old dispensation; the bondage in which they were held (<span class="greekheb">ἔνοχοι</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἐνεχόμενοι</span>, “held” or “bound,” “subject to,” see Thayer, s.v.), and from which Christ delivered <span class="greekheb">τούτους ὅσοι</span>, not as if it were a restricted number who were delivered, but on the contrary to mark that the deliverance was coextensive with the bondage. <span class="greekheb">ἀπαλλάξῃ</span>, used especially of freeing from slavery [exx. from Philo in Carpzov, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> Isocrates <span class="greekheb">οὗτος ἀπήλλαξεν αὐτοὺς τοῦ δέους τούτου</span>. In the <span class="ital">Phaedo</span> frequently of soul emancipated from the body.] How the Son wrought this deliverance <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ θανάτου</span> can now be answered; and it cannot be better answered than in the words of Robertson Smith: “To break this sway, Jesus takes upon Himself that mortal flesh and blood to whose infirmities the fear of death under the O.T. attaches. But while He passes through all the weakness of fleshly life, and, finally, through death itself, He, unlike all others, proves Himself not only exempt from the fear of death, but victorious over the accuser. To Him, who in His sinlessness experienced every weakness of mortality, without diminution of his unbroken strength of fellowship with God, death is not the dreaded sign of separation from God’s grace (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7</a>), but a step in his divinely appointed career; not something inflicted on Him against His will, but a means whereby (<span class="greekheb">διὰ</span> with genitive) He consciously and designedly accomplishes His vocation as Saviour. For this victory of Jesus over the devil, or, which is the same thing, the fear of death, must be taken, like every other part of His work, in connection with the idea of His vocation as Head and Leader of His people.” In short, we see now what is meant by His tasting death “<span class="ital">for every man</span>,” and how this death guarantees the perfect dominion and glory depicted in Psalms 8. All the humiliation and death are justified by the necessities of the case, he concludes, “For, as I need scarcely say, it is not angels (presumably sinless and spiritual beings, <span class="greekheb">πνεύματα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>) He is taking in hand, but He is taking in hand Abraham’s seed (the dying children of a dead father; ‘also dergleichen sterbliche und durch Todesfurcht in Knechtschaft befangene Wesen,’ Bleek). <span class="greekheb">δήπου</span>: frequently in classics, as Plato, <span class="ital">Protagoras</span>, 309 C. <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ δήπου ἐνέτυχες</span>, “for I may take it for granted you have not met” (<span class="ital">Apol.</span>, 21 B). <span class="greekheb">τί ποτε λέγει ὁ θεός</span> … <span class="greekheb">φάσκων ἐμὲ σοφώτατον εἶναι</span>; <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ δήπου ψεύδεταί γε</span>, “for, at any rate, as need hardly be said, he is not saying what is untrue”. <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλαμβάνεται</span>: “lays hold to help” or simply “succours,” with the idea of taking a person up to see him through. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <span class="ital"><a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/4-11.htm" title="Wisdom exalteth her children, and layeth hold of them that seek her.">Sir 4:11</a></span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ σοφία</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλαμβάνεται τῶν ζητούντων αὐτήν</span>, and the Scholiast on Aesch., <span class="ital">Pers.</span>, 742, <span class="greekheb">ὅταν σπεύδῃ τις εἰς καλὰ ἢ εἰς κακά</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπιλαμβάνεται</span>. Castellio was the first to propose the meaning “help” in place of “assume the nature of,” and Beza having urged the latter rendering as being that of the Greek fathers, goes on to say, “quo magis est execranda Castellionis audacia qui <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλαμ</span>. convertit ‘<span class="ital">opitulatur</span>,’ non modo falsa, sed etiam inepta interpretatione, etc.”. It has been suggested that <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span> might be the nominative which would give quite a good sense, but as Christ is the subject both of the foregoing and of the succeeding clause it is more likely that this affirmation also is made of Him. It is certainly remarkable that instead of saying “He lays hold of man to help him,” the writer should give the restricted <span class="greekheb">σπέρματος Ἀβ</span>. Von Soden, who supposes the Epistle is addressed to Gentiles, thinks the writer intends to prepare the way for his introducing the priesthood of Christ, and to exhibit the claim of Christians to the fulfilment of the prophecies made to Abraham (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Robertson Smith), but this Weiss brands as “eine leere Ausflucht”. Perhaps we cannot get further than Estius (cited by Bleek): “gentium vocationem tota hac epistola prudenter dissimulat, sive quod illius mentio Hebraeis parum grata esset, sive quod instituto suo non necessaria”. Or, as Bleek says. “es erklârt sich aus dem Zwecke des Briefes”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14–18</span>.

It is nowhere very frequent in the N.T. The English reader is liable to be misled by the rendering “devils” for “demons” in the Gospels. Satan has the power of death, if that be the meaning here, not as lord, but as executioner (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-11.htm" title="And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon.">Revelation 9:11</a>); his power is only a permissive power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.

Here the purpose of the Incarnation is set forth as requiring the complete association of the SON with human brethren to which prophecy had pointed. But more is now declared than the prophecies so far quoted have implied; and thus is introduced (by way of anticipation, as is usual in the Epistle) the doctrine of atonement, which is to be dwelt on afterwards. For the object of Christ's becoming one of us is now further said to be that by <span class="accented">dying</span> he might effect <span class="accented">redemption.</span> The "children" in ver. 14 are the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the type in Isaiah, fulfilled in the "many sons" to be "sanctified" and brought to glory. (We may observe, by the way, the difference between the words used of their participation in human nature and of Christ's - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>: the aorist in the latter case expresses his sharing what was not his before, and so distinctly implies his pre-existence.) For understanding' the account here given of the purpose of the Incarnation, we must remember that <span class="accented">death</span>, originally announced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>) as the penalty of transgression, is regarded in the New Testament (notably by St. Paul) as the sign of the continual dominion of sin over the human race. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12, 15</a> the mere fact that all men "from Adam to Moses" had died is adduced as sufficient proof that all were under condemnation as sinners. Whatever further idea is implied in the word "death " - such as alienation from God in whom is life eternal, or any "blackness of darkness" thereupon ensuing in the world beyond the grave - of man's subjection or liability to all this his natural death is regarded as the sign. It is to be remembered, too, that "the devil," through whom it was that sin first entered, and death through sin, is revealed to us generally as the representative of evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), and, as such, the primeval manslayer (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), with power given him over death, the penalty of sin, as long as man remains in his dominion, unredeemed. Till redemption cast a new light upon the gloom of death, man was all his life long in fear of it; its shadow was upon him from his birth; it loomed ever before him as a passing into darkness, unrelieved by hope. We know well how the hopeless dismalness of death was a commonplace with the classical poets, and how, even now, the natural man shrinks from it as the last great evil. But Christ, human, yet sinless, died for all mankind, and, so dying, wrested from the devil his power over death, and emancipated believers from their state of "bondage" (as to which, see below). On particular expressions in this passage we may remark: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That, "having the power of death," which has been variously interpreted, may be taken in the usual sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, viz. "having power, or dominion, <span class="accented">over."</span> Satan has had the dominion over death allowed him because of human sin. And it may be observed that elsewhere, not only death, but other woes that flesh is heir to - its precursors and harbingers - are attributed to Satanic agency (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-16.htm">Luke 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Christ is not here said to have as yet abolished death itself; only to have rendered impotent him that had the power of it; for natural death still "reigns," though to believers it has no "sting." In the end (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>) death itself will be destroyed. In one passage, indeed, it is spoken of by St. Paul as already abolished (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>); but this is in the way of anticipation: death is already vanquished and disarmed to believers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The bondage (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) spoken of is the condition of unredeemed man, often so designated by St. Paul. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. and 8, where man's bondage (felt when conscience is awake) to "the law of sin in the members," and his emancipation from it through faith, are described; and especially Romans 8:15, 16, 17 ("For ye have not received the spirit of <span class="accented">bondage</span> again to <span class="accented">fear</span>," etc.), as elucidating <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span>The word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, followed this passage by the genitive (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), expresses here more than "<span class="accented">liability</span> to;" it implies present implication, equivalent to "in hold to."

Comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-21.htm">Romans 5:21</a>, "Sin reigned in death."<p>That is the devil<p>An explanation has been sought in the Jewish doctrine which identified Satan with Sammal, the angel of death, who, according to the later Jews, tempted Eve. This is fanciful, and has no value, to say nothing of the fact that Michael and not Sammal was the angel of death to the Israelites. The O.T. nowhere identifies Satan with the serpent in Eden. That identification is found in Wisd. 2:24, and is adopted <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. The devil has not power to inflict death, nor is death, as such, done away by the bringing of the devil to nought. The sense of the passage is that Satan's dominion in the region of death is seen in the existence and power of the fear of death as the penalty of sin (comp. through fear of death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-15.htm">Hebrews 2:15</a>). The fear of death as implying rejection by God is distinctly to be seen in O.T. It appears in the utterances of many of the Psalmists. There is a consciousness of the lack of a pledge that God will not, in any special case, rise up against one. Along with this goes the conception of Satan as the accuser, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-10</a>. This idea may possibly give coloring to this passage. Even before death the accuser exercises sway, and keeps God's people in bondage so long as they are oppressed with the fear of death as indicating the lack of full acceptance with God. How strongly this argument would appeal to Hebrew readers of the Epistle is clear from rabbinical theology, which often speaks of the fear of death, and the accuser as a constant companion of man's life. Jesus assumes the mortal flesh and blood which are subject to this bondage. He proves himself to be both exempt from the fear of death and victorious over the accuser. He never lost his sense of oneness with God, so that death was not to him a sign of separation from God's grace. It was a step in his appointed career; a means (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) whereby he accomplished his vocation as Savior.
