Here are earnest exhortations to several Christian duties, especially contentment. The sin opposed to this grace and duty is covetousness, an over-eager desire for the wealth of this world, with envy of those who have more than ourselves. Having treasures in heaven, we may be content with mean things here. Those who cannot be so, would not be content though God raised their condition. Adam was in paradise, yet not contented; some angels in heaven were not contented; but the apostle Paul, though abased and empty, had learned in every state, in any state, to be content. Christians have reason to be contented with their present lot. This promise contains the sum and substance of all the promises; I will never, no, never leave thee, no, never forsake thee. In the original there are no less than five negatives put together, to confirm the promise: the true believer shall have the gracious presence of God with him, in life, at death, and for ever.

It is not to be undervalued by the pretence of the superior purity of a state of celibacy, as if marriage were improper for any class of people or any condition of life; and it should not be dishonored by any violation of the marriage contract. The course of things has shown that there was abundant reason for the apostle to assert with emphasis, that "marriage was an honorable condition of life." There has been a constant effort made to show that celibacy was a more holy state; that there was something in marriage that rendered it "dishonorable" for those who are in the ministry, and for those of either sex who would be eminently pure. This sentiment has been the cause of more abomination in the world than any other single opinion claiming to have a religious sanction. It is one of the supports on which the Papal system rests, and has been one of the principal upholders of all the corruptions in monasteries and nunneries. The apostle asserts, without any restriction or qualification, that marriage is honorable in all; and this proves that it is lawful for the ministers of religion to marry, and that the whole doctrine of the superior purity of a state of celibacy is false; see this subject examined in the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>.<p>And the bed undefiled - Fidelity to the marriage vow.<p>But whore mongers and adulterers God will judge - All licentiousness of life, and all violations of the marriage covenant, will be severely punished by God; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>.

"To avoid fornication let EVERY MAN have his own wife" (1Co 7:2). Judaism and Gnosticism combined were soon about to throw discredit on marriage. The venerable Paphnutius, in the Council of Nice, quoted this verse for the justification of the married state. If one does not himself marry, he should not prevent others from doing so. Others, especially Romanists, translate, "in all things," as in Heb 13:18. But the warning being against lasciviousness, the contrast to "whoremongers and adulterers" in the parallel clause, requires the "in all" in this clause to refer to persons.<p>the bed undefiled&#8212;Translate, as Greek requires "undefiled" to be a predicate, not an epithet, "And let the bed be undefiled."<p>God will judge&#8212;Most whoremongers escape the notice of human tribunals; but God takes particular cognizance of those whom man does not punish.

Some read these words as an exhortation, "let" it "be so"; others as an assertion, it is so. "Marriage" is the union of one man and one woman in wedlock, whereby they become one flesh; it is a joining together of male and female in this relation, and of two only, and of such as are not within the degrees of blood forbid by the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6</a> and of such as are fit for marriage: and this is "honourable", as it was instituted by God, and has been honoured with the presence of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22</a>. And it is so in the ends of it, being to procreate children, multiply the earth, build up families, preserve a legitimate offspring, and prevent fornication and all uncleanness; and it is so, when the duties of the relation are performed on both sides: and it is honourable "in all"; in all things, in all respects, upon all accounts; "every way", as the Arabic version renders it; or as the Ethiopic version, "everywhere"; it has been honourably esteemed of among all nations; it becomes persons of all ranks and degrees, quality, and order; and it is honourable in all that are lawfully married, and do not violate the marriage contract, or defile the marriage bed: hereby are condemned such who despise marriage, that they may give a loose to their wandering and insatiable lusts; and such who, under a pretence of greater sanctity and perfection, reject it as unlawful; and the Papists, who deny it to men employed in sacred work: <p>and the bed undefiled: the Arabic version reads, "his bed"; and the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, "their bed"; the bed of such whose marriage is honourable; which is not polluted by admitting others into it, or by acts of fornication and adultery: "but", or "for", as the Alexandrian copy reads, <p>whoremongers and adulterers God will judge; the former of these may be rendered "fornicators", as it is by the Vulgate Latin version: fornication is a sin committed by single persons, unmarried ones; and though it was reckoned among the Gentiles a thing indifferent, yet is contrary to the law of God, and is a work of the flesh, and makes unfit for the kingdom of God, and brings down the judgments of God both here and hereafter. And this is in opposition to marriage, which is appointed to prevent it. The sin "adulterers" are guilty of, is a sin committed by persons, who are either one or both in a married state, and so is directly a pollution of the marriage bed: this was punishable with death by the law of God, and light of nature; and though men may make light of it, God will judge and punish such as commit it, both in this life, with diseases, poverty, and disgrace, and in the world to come, at the great day of account; for however secretly it may be committed, God, who is omniscient, sees it, and will bring it into judgment; nor shall any be able to escape the righteous judgment of God, for he is omnipotent, as well as omniscient.

But against this stands the addition: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ κοίτη ἀμίαντος</span>, since the latter could not be asserted as a truth in point of fact. Rather might the indicative rendering thereof be preserved by taking the clauses <span class="ital">descriptively</span>: “Marriage honourable in all things,” etc., which then would not be different in sense from the direct requirement that marriage should be honourable. Nevertheless, this mode of interpretation too—recently adopted by Delitzsch—could only be justified if it were followed by a long series of similar statements; here, on the other hand, where imperatives are placed in close proximity before and after, it is unnatural.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ γάμος</span>] <span class="ital">marriage</span>.

The majority take <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν</span> as <span class="ital">masculine</span>. There is then found expressed in it the precept, either, as by Luther and others, that marriage should in the estimation of all be held in honour, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> not desecrated by adultery; or, as by Böhme, Schulz, and others, that it should not be despised or slighted by any unmarried person (according to Hofmann, by any one, whether he live in wedlock, or he think that he ought for his own part to decline it); or finally, as by Calvin and many, that it is to be denied to no order of men (as later to the Catholic priests). In the two last cases it is generally supposed that the reference is to a definite party of those who, out of ascetic or other interest, looked unfavourably upon the married life. But for all three modes of explanation, <span class="greekheb">παρὰ πᾶσιν</span> would have been more suitably written than <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν</span>; and a preference for celibacy on the part of born Jews in particular, to whom nevertheless the Epistle to the Hebrews is addressed, is an unexplained presupposition, because one not in accordance with the teaching of history.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ κοίτη ἀμίαντος</span>] <span class="ital">and the marriage bed</span> (against the ordinary <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>, Valckenaer and Schulz: <span class="ital">the cohabitation</span>) <span class="ital">be undefiled</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πόρνους γὰρ καὶ μοιχοὺς κρινεῖ ὁ Θεός</span>] <span class="ital">for fornicators and adulterers will God judge</span> (condemn at the judgment of the world).

The <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span> placed at the close of the sentence is not without emphasis.

As a natural result of holding marriage in honour, its ideal sanctity will be violated neither by the married nor by the unmarried. Therefore the <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> links the two clauses closely together and has some inferential force, “and thus let the bed be undefiled” [<span class="greekheb">μιαίνειν τὴν κοίτην</span> occurs in Plutarch to denote the violation of conjugal relations.

Scripture never gives even the most incidental sanction to the exaltation of celibacy as a superior virtue, or to the disparagement of marriage as an inferior state. Celibacy and marriage stand on an exactly equal level of honour according as God has called us to the one or the other state. The mediæval glorification of Monachism sprang partly from a religion of exaggerated gloom and terror, and partly from a complete misunderstanding of the sense applied by Jewish writers to the word “Virgins.” Nothing can be clearer than the teaching on this subject alike of the Old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-18.htm" title="And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.">Genesis 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>) and of the New Covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-4.htm" title="And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,...">Matthew 19:4-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/2-1.htm" title="And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:...">John 2:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>).

So it is also taken by Chrysostom and other ancients. If so, it is a declaration, interposed among hortations, of the honorableness of the" estate of matrimony," with the hortatory purpose of suggesting this "remedy against sin "(as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>), or as a protest against false asceticism, such as is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>, "forbidding to marry." And certainly the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, taken by itself, would most naturally have this meaning. But most modern commentators understand it as an exhortation, supplying <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>; and this for the following cogent reasons: it occurs in the midst of a series of exhortations, and is therefore more likely to be one; it is difficult to understand the connected clause, "and the bed undefiled (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," as a statement; and the exactly similar phrase in ver. 5, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, seems evidently hortatory. Hence we take it to mean "Let marriage <span class="accented">be</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>." Two questions remain - that of the import of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is masculine or neuter. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> elsewhere, when applied to persons, means "held in honor" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34</a>, of Gamaliel); when applied to things, it means "precious" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>, of precious stones; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, of the blood of the Lamb; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>, of promises; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>, of "my own life;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>, of the fruit of the earth). Bengel explains thus: "Caelibes, quibus periculum scortationis imminet, hortatur ut matrimonium contrahant, tanquam <span class="accented">pretiosum</span> quiddam agnoscentes, ejusque bone digne utantur. Conf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>.' And, taking <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> as masculine, he explains further: "Omnesque debent matrimonium magni facere, ut, si quis eo ipse non utatur, alios tamen non prohibeat." According to this view the first clause is an injunction to all to appreciate marriage, the second warns those that are married against any violation of the bond: "<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> antitheton ad scortatotes, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ad adulteros" (Bengel). But the more natural, and the usual, meaning of the common expression <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "in all things," not "among all persons" (cf. <span class="accented">Jaffa</span>, ver. 18; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-9.htm">Titus 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>).

'In the conclusion of the verse "for" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) suits the drift of the sentence as above understood, and is considered to be supported better than "but" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) of the Textus Receptus.
