The apostle then states what is their duty to living ministers; to obey and submit to them, so far as is agreeable to the mind and will of God, made known in his word. Christians must not think themselves too wise, too good, or too great, to learn. The people must search the Scriptures, and so far as the ministers teach according to that rule, they ought to receive their instructions as the word of God, which works in those that believe. It is the interest of hearers, that the account their ministers give of them may be with joy, and not with grief. Faithful ministers deliver their own souls, but the ruin of a fruitless and faithless people will be upon their own heads. The more earnestly the people pray for their ministers, the more benefit they may expect from their ministry. A good conscience has respect to all God's commands, and all our duty. Those who have this good conscience, yet need the prayers of others. When ministers come to a people who pray for them, they come with greater satisfaction to themselves, and success to the people. We should seek all our mercies by prayer. God is the God of peace, fully reconciled to believers; who has made a way for peace and reconciliation between himself and sinners, and who loves peace on earth, especially in his churches. He is the Author of spiritual peace in the hearts and consciences of his people. How firm a covenant is that which has its foundation in the blood of the Son of God! The perfecting of the saints in every good work, is the great thing desired by them, and for them; and that they may at length be fitted for the employment and happiness of heaven. There is no good thing wrought in us, but it is the work of God. And no good thing is wrought in us by God, but through Christ, for his sake and by his Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Obey them that have the rule over you - Margin, guide; see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>. The reference here is to their religious teachers, and not to civil rulers. They were to show them proper respect, and to submit to their authority in the church, so far as it was administered in accordance with the precepts of the Saviour. The obligation to obedience does not, of course, extend to anything which is wrong in itself, or which would be a violation of conscience. The doctrine is, that subordination is necessary to the welfare of the church, and that there ought to be a disposition to yield all proper obedience to those who are set over us in the Lord; compare notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a>.<p>And submit yourselves - That is, to all which they enjoin that is lawful and right. There are in relation to a society:<p>(1) those things which God has positively commanded - which are always to be obeyed.<p>(2) many things which have been agreed on by the society as needful for its welfare - and these are to be submitted to unless they violate the rights of conscience; and<p>(3) many things which are in themselves a matter of no express divine command, and of no formal enactment by the community. They are matters of convenience; things that tend to the order and harmony of the community, and of the propriety of these, "rulers" in the church and elsewhere should be allowed to judge, and we should submit to them patiently.<p>Hence, in the church we are to submit to all the proper regulations for conducting public worship; for the promotion of religion; and for the administration of discipline.<p>For they watch for your souls - They have no selfish aim in this. They do not seek "to lord it over God's heritage." It is for your own good that they do this, and you should therefore submit to these arrangements. And this shows also the true principle on which authority should be exercised in a church. It should be in such a way as to promote the salvation of the people; and all the arrangements should be with that end. The measures adopted, therefore, and the obedience enjoined, should not be arbitrary, oppressive, or severe, but should be such as will really promote salvation.<p>As they that must give account - To God. The ministers of religion must give account to God for their fidelity. For all that they teach, and for every measure which they adopt, they must soon be called into judgment. There is, therefore, the best security that under the influence of this solemn truth they will pursue only that course which will be for your good.<p>That they may do it with joy, and not with grief - Greek &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  me&#772; stenazontes - not sighing, or groaning; as they would who had been unsuccessful. The meaning is, that they should so obey, that when their teachers came to give up their account they need not do it with sorrow over their perverseness and disobedience.<p>For this is unprofitable for you - That is, their giving up their account in that manner - as unsuccessful in their efforts to save you - would not be of advantage to you, but would be highly injurious. This is a strong mode of expressing the idea that it must be attended with eminent peril to their souls to have their religious teachers go and give an account against them. As they would wish, therefore, to avoid that, they should render to them all proper honor and obedience. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Obey them that have the rule over you&#8212;(Compare Heb 13:7, 24). This threefold mention of the rulers is peculiar to this Epistle. In other Epistles Paul includes the rulers in his exhortations. But here the address is limited to the general body of the Church, in contrast to the rulers to whom they are charged to yield reverent submission. Now this is just what might be expected when the apostle of the Gentiles was writing to the Palestine Christians, among whom James and the eleven apostles had exercised a more immediate authority. It was important he should not seem to set himself in opposition to their guides, but rather strengthen their hands; he claims no authority directly or indirectly over these rulers themselves [Birks]. "Remember" your deceased rulers (Heb 13:7). "Obey" your living rulers; nay, more, not only obey in cases where no sacrifice of self is required, and where you are persuaded they are right (so the Greek, for "obey"), but "submit yourselves" as a matter of dutiful yielding, when your judgment and natural will incline you in an opposite direction.<p>they&#8212;on their part; so the Greek. As they do their part, so do you yours. So Paul exhorts, 1Th 5:12, 13.<p>watch&#8212;"are vigilant" (Greek).<p>for&#8212;Greek, "in behalf of."<p>must give account&#8212;The strongest stimulus to watchfulness (Mr 13:34-37). Chrysostom was deeply struck with these words, as he tells us [On the Priesthood, 6], "The fear of this threat continually agitates my soul."<p>do it&#8212;"watch for your soul's eternal salvation." It is a perilous responsibility for a man to have to give account for others' deeds, who is not sufficient for his own [Estius, from Aquinas]. I wonder whether it be possible that any of the rulers should be saved [Chrysostom]. Compare Paul's address to the elders, Ac 20:28; 1Co 4:1-5, where also he connects ministers' responsibility with the account to be hereafter given (compare 1Pe 5:4).<p>with joy&#8212;at your obedience; anticipating, too, that you shall be their "joy" in the day of giving account (Php 4:1).<p>not with grief&#8212;at your disobedience; apprehending also that in the day of account you may be among the lost, instead of being their crown of rejoicing. In giving account, the stewards are liable to blame if aught be lost to the Master. "Mitigate their toil by every office of attention and respect, that with alacrity, rather than with grief, they may fulfil their duty, arduous enough in itself, even though no unpleasantness be added on your part" [Grotius].<p>that&#8212;Grief in your pastors is unprofitable for you, for it weakens their spiritual power; nay, more, "the groans (so the Greek for 'grief') of other creatures are heard; how much more of pastors!" [Bengel]. So God will be provoked to avenge on you their "groaning" (Greek). If they must render God an account of their negligence, so must you for your ingratitude to them [Grotius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:</span> the further duty required by Christ from the subjects of his kingdom, is their due demeanour to their present pastors, and church guides, or rulers.

The soul of Chrysostom was always struck with these words, as he himself confesses at the beginning of the 6th Book de Sacerdotio, on which passage we have made some observations, p. 490.—<span class="greekheb">μετὰ χαρᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">with joy</span>) if they see you respond to their vigilance.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>, <span class="ital">this</span>) This <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> does not refer to <span class="ital">they who are to give an account</span>, but to <span class="ital">they watch</span>. Disciples ought to <span class="ital">obey</span> and <span class="ital">submit</span> to their teachers, <span class="ital">so that with joy</span>, etc. It would be not a joyous (<span class="greekheb">μετὰ χαρᾶς</span>) thing for the teachers themselves to <span class="ital">give in their account with sorrow</span> [therefore <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> does not refer to the <span class="ital">giving in the account</span>]: on the contrary, <span class="ital">to watch with sorrow</span>, is not hurtful to the teachers, it is “unprofitable” to the hearers.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ μὴ</span>, <span class="ital">and not</span>) He is not a good minister who does not either <span class="ital">rejoice</span> or <span class="ital">grieve</span>, or do both.—<span class="greekheb">στενάζοντες</span>, <span class="ital">with grief</span>) The groans of other creatures are heard; how much more of pastors?—<span class="greekheb">ἀλυσιτελὲς</span>, <span class="ital">unprofitable</span>) Sorrow, opposed to <span class="ital">joy</span>, from which <span class="ital">griefs</span> (<span class="ital">groans</span>, implied in <span class="greekheb">στενάζοντες</span>) are derived, greatly weakens the teachers; and their <span class="ital">sighs</span> are <span class="ital">not profitable</span>, nay, are very injurious to the disciples.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Obey them that have the rule over you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, as in ver. 7), <span class="cmt_word">and submit yourselves</span> (to them): <span class="cmt_word">for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it With joy, and not With grief</span> (literally, <span class="accented">groaning</span>); <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for that is</span> (rather, <span class="accented">were</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unprofitable for you</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> their ministry is for your profit; if its result be their giving in their account with groans, its whole purpose will be frustrated). In this allusion to the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> as in vers. 7 and 24, there is evidence of the existence of a regular order of ministry in the Hebrew Churches, such as many allusions in St. Paul's Epistles show to have formed part of the constitution of the Churches to whom those Epistles were addressed (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a> and Acts 20:17, 28, etc.). The word itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) which is here used might, indeed, denote any persons who took the lead in the congregations; but the urging of the duty of <span class="accented">submission</span> to them, in virtue of their office of watching for souls for which they would have to give account, shows plainly that a special order is here, as elsewhere, referred to. Observe also below, ver. 24, where "<span class="accented">all</span> the saints," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what we should call the laity, are mentioned in distinction from the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. (For similar injunctions, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> being the words there used.) The special injunction here to obey and submit may have been called for by some deficiency in this respect among the Hebrew Christians. Possibly it was among the people rather than the pastors that there were any signs of wavering between the Church and the synagogue, and that one purpose of the admonition is to strengthen the hands of the former, in whom confidence is placed. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They watch (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-33.htm">Mark 13:33</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-36.htm">Luke 21:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>.<p>With grief (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit. groaning.
