And though their ministers were some dead, others dying, yet the great Head and High Priest of the church, the Bishop of their souls, ever lives, and is ever the same. Christ is the same in the Old Testament day. as in the gospel day, and will be so to his people for ever, equally merciful, powerful, and all-sufficient. Still he fills the hungry, encourages the trembling, and welcomes repenting sinners: still he rejects the proud and self-righteous, abhors mere profession, and teaches all whom he saves, to love righteousness, and to hate iniquity. Believers should seek to have their hearts established in simple dependence on free grace, by the Holy Spirit, which would comfort their hearts, and render them proof against delusion. Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice; he sanctifies the gift. The Lord's supper is the feast of the gospel passover. Having showed that keeping to the Levitical law would, according to its own rules, keep men from the Christian altar, the apostle adds, Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp; go forth from the ceremonial law, from sin, from the world, and from ourselves. Living by faith in Christ, set apart to God through his blood, let us willingly separate from this evil world. Sin, sinners, nor death, will not suffer us to continue long here; therefore let us go forth now by faith and seek in Christ the rest and peace which this world cannot afford us. Let us bring our sacrifices to this altar, and to this our High Priest, and offer them up by him. The sacrifice of praise to God, we should offer always. In this are worship and prayer, as well as thanksgiving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember them which have the rule over you - Margin, "are the guides." The word used here means properly "leaders, guides, directors." It is often applied to military commanders. Here it means teachers - appointed to lead or guide them to eternal life. It does not refer to them so much as rulers or governors, as teachers, or guides. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, however, it is used in the former sense. The duty here enjoined is that of remembering them; that is, remembering their counsel; their instructions; their example.<p>Who have spoken to you the word of God - Preachers; either apostles or others. Respect is to be shown to the ministerial office, by whomsoever it is borne.<p>Whose faith follow - That is, imitate; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-12.htm">Hebrews 6:12</a>.<p>Considering the end of their conversation - Of their conduct; of their manner of life. The word rendered here "the end" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  ekbasis - occurs only here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>, where it is rendered "a way of escape." It properly means, "a going out, an egress," and is hence spoken of as a going out from life, or of an exit from the world - "death." This is probably the meaning here. It does not mean, as our translation would seem to imply, that Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever, was the aim or end for which they lived - for the Greek will not bear that construction; but it means that they were attentively to contemplate the end or the issue of the conduct of those holy teachers - the close or going out of all that they did; to wit, in a peaceful death. Their faith sustained them. They were enabled to persevere in a Christian course, and did not faint or fail. There is allusion, doubtless, to those who had been their religious instructors, and who had died in the faith of the gospel, either by persecution or by an ordinary death, and the apostle points to them as examples of that to which he would exhort those whom he addressed - of perseverance in the faith until death. Thus explained, this verse does not refer to the duty of Christians toward living teachers, but toward those who are dead. Their duty toward living teachers is enforced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>. The sentiment here is, that the proper remembrance of those now deceased who were once our spiritual instructors and guides, should be allowed to have an important influence in inducing us to lead a holy life. We should remember them with affection and gratitude; we should recall the truths which they taught, and the exhortations which they addressed to us; we should cherish with kind affection the memory of all that they did for our welfare, and we should not forget the effect of the truths which they taught in sustaining their own souls when they died. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Two manifestations of "brotherly love," hospitality and care for those in bonds.<p>Be not forgetful&#8212;implying it was a duty which they all recognized, but which they might forget to act on (Heb 13:3, 7, 16).

To obviate the natural distrust felt of strangers, Paul says, an unknown guest may be better than he looks: he may be unexpectedly found to be as much a messenger of God for good, as the angels (whose name means messenger) are; nay more, if a Christian, he represents Christ Himself. There is a play on the same Greek word, Be not forgetful and unaware; let not the duty of hospitality to strangers escape you; for, by entertaining strangers, it has escaped the entertainers that they were entertaining angels. Not unconscious and forgetful of the duty, they have unconsciously brought on themselves the blessing.<p>7.

Christ's church is a kingdom, and he is King in it; pastors of churches are subordinate governors; who rule well when they rule not in an arbitrary way, according to their own wills, but according to the laws of Christ, with all faithfulness, prudence, and diligence. The word may be rendered "guides" or "leaders"; for such point out the way of peace, life, and salvation to men, and direct them to Christ; and guide them into the understanding of the Scriptures, and the truths of the Gospel; and lead them in the paths of faith and holiness, and are examples to them. The Greek word, here used, is what the Jews call Christian bishops by; and  is, by Maimonides (w), said to be the same as  "a bishopric": to "remember" them is to know, own, acknowledge, and respect them as their governors; to obey them, and submit to them; to treasure up in memory their doctrines and exhortations; to be mindful of them at the throne of grace, to pray for them; and to take care of their maintenance and outward supply of life: <p>who have spoken unto you the word of God; of which God is the author, being agreeably to the Scriptures, given by inspiration of God; the subject of which is the love and grace of God in Christ; and which God makes useful for conversion and comfort; and which, when spoken aright, is spoken freely, boldly, and faithfully: <p>whose faith follow; or "imitate"; meaning either their faithfulness, by owning the truths and ordinances of the Gospel before men; by reproving fellow Christians in love; by discharging the several duties of their place in the church; and by performing the private duties of life: or the grace of faith, their strong exercise of it, together with its fruits and effects, love, and good works; also the profession of their faith, which they hold fast unto the end; and the doctrine of faith, by embracing the same, as it appears agreeably to the word; by abiding by it, standing fast in it, striving for it, and persevering in it to the end. <p>Considering the end of their conversation; which may intend the whole of their conduct in the discharge of the several duties of their office; the end of which designs either the manner of it, as De Dieu explains it, agreeably to the sense of the Hebrew word, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a> or the drift and scope of it, which was Christ, his honour and glory, as in connection with the following verse; or the event of it in life, being for the glory of God, and the good of men; or rather the issue of it in death, or what a comfortable end they made; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "considering" their "last manner of living, in their exit out of the world"; and this is to be considered for imitation and encouragement. <p>(w) In Misn.

But an additional reason is suggested in the following clause, <span class="greekheb">ὧν ἀναθεωροῦντες</span> … “whose faith imitate as you closely consider the issue of their manner of life”. <span class="greekheb">ὧν</span> follows <span class="greekheb">ἀναστροφῆς</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀναθεωρέω</span> in Theophrastus and Diodorus Siculus is explicitly contrasted with the simple verb to denote a keener and more careful observation. We cannot therefore render, as naturally we might, “look back upon”. <span class="greekheb">ἔκβασιν</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1 Corinthians 10:18</a> has the meaning “escape”; but in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-17.htm" title="Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.">Wis 2:17</a>, as here, it denotes the end of life with a distinct reference to the manner of it, as illustrating the man’s relation to God. The leading men among the Hebrew Christians had, whether by martyrdom (as Weiss, etc.) or not, sealed their teaching and exhibited a faith worthy of imitation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm" title="Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.">Hebrews 13:8</a> gives force both to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm" title="Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.">Hebrews 13:7</a> and to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-9.htm" title="Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.">Hebrews 13:9</a>. Imitate their faith, for the object of faith has not changed nor passed away. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς ἐχθὲς</span>.… “Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day is the same, yea and for ever.” <span class="greekheb">ὁ αὐτὸς</span> exactly as in Plutarch’s <span class="ital">Pericles</span>, xv. 2, where in describing the influence of success upon Pericles it is said <span class="greekheb">οὐκέθʼ ὁ αὐτὸς ἧν</span>, he was no longer the same. <span class="greekheb">ἐχθὲς</span> is the proper Attic form, <span class="greekheb">χθές</span> the old Ionic, see Rutherford’s <span class="ital">New Phryn.</span>, 370. “Yesterday and to-day,” in the past and in the present Jesus Christ is the same, and He will never be different. Therefore, <span class="greekheb">διδαχαῖς ποικίλαις καὶ ξέναις μὴ παραφέρεσθε</span>. “Be not carried away by teachings various and unheard of, and foreign.” <span class="greekheb">παραφερ</span>. is used in Diodorus and Plutarch of being swept away by a river in flood; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">παραρυῶμεν</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-1.htm" title="Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.">Hebrews 2:1</a>. The teachings against which the Hebrews are here warned are such constructions of Old Testament institutions and practises as tended to loosen their attachment to Christ as the sole mediator of the New Covenant. These teachings were “various,” inasmuch as they laid stress now on one aspect, now on another of the old economy [“bald in der Schriftgelehrsamkeit, bald in peinlicher Gesetzseserfüllung, bald im Opferkult, bald in den Opfermahlzeiten” (Weiss)]. They were <span class="greekheb">ξέναι</span> both as being novel and as being irreconcileable with pure Christian truth. <span class="greekheb">καλὸν γὰρ χάριτι</span>.… “For it is good that by grace the heart be confirmed, not by meats.” The present wavering unsatisfactory condition of the Hebrews is to be exchanged for one of confidence and steadfastness not by listening to teachings about meats which after all cannot nourish the heart, but by approaching the throne where grace reigns and from which it is dispensed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>. From the following verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10</a>) in which sacrificial food is expressly mentioned, it would appear that the reference in <span class="greekheb">οὐ βρώμασιν</span> is not to asceticism nor to the distinction of clean and unclean meats, but to sacrificial meals. These are condemned by experiment as useless, <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς οὐκ ὠφελήθησαν</span> … “which were of no avail to those who had recourse to them” (Moffatt). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενὲς καὶ ἀνωφελές</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.">Hebrews 7:18</a>. Sacrificial meals are also shown to be irreconcileable (<span class="greekheb">ξέναι</span>) with the Christian approach to God, for our (the Christian) altar is one from which neither worshippers nor priests have any right to eat. The point he wishes to make is, that in connection with the Christian sacrifice there is no sacrificial meal. As in the case of the great sacrifice of the Day of Atonement the High Priest carried the blood into the Holy of Holies, while the carcase was not eaten but burned outside the camp; so the Christian altar is not one from which food is dispensed to priest and worshipper. <span class="greekheb">οἱ τῇ σκηνῇ λατρεύοντες</span> refers to the Christian worshippers. The figure introduced in <span class="greekheb">θυσιαστήριον</span> is continued in these words. To refer them to the O.T. priests is to shatter the argument. Literally the words mean “they who serve the tabernacle,” that is, the priests, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>. The peculiarity, he says, of our Christian sacrifice is that it is not eaten. Then follows in support of this statement an analogy from the O.T. ritual, <span class="greekheb">ὧν γὰρ εἰσφέρεται ζώων</span>.… “For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the High Priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.” <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-12.htm" title="Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.">Leviticus 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-21.htm" title="And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.">Leviticus 4:21</a>. In conformity with this type (<span class="greekheb">διὸ καὶ Ἰησοῦς</span>) Jesus, that He by His own blood might purify the people from their sin, suffered outside the gate. “The burning of the victim was not intended to sublimate but to get rid of it. The body plays no part in the atoning act, and has in fact no significance after the blood has been drained from it. The life, and therefore the atoning energy, resides in the blood and in the blood alone. On the writer’s scheme, then, no function is left for the body of Jesus. It is ‘through his own blood,’ that he must ‘sanctify the people’. It is thus inevitable that while the writer fully recognises the fact of the Resurrection of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>), he can assign no place to it in his argument or attach to it any theological significance” (Peake). The suffering <span class="greekheb">ἔξω τῆς πύλης</span> is equivalent to the <span class="greekheb">αἰσχύνη</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>; the ignominy of the malefactor’s death was an essential element in the suffering. The utmost that man inflicts upon criminals he bore. He was made to feel that he was outcast and condemned. But it is this which wins all men to Him. <span class="greekheb">τοίνυν ἐξερχώμεθα πρὸς αὐτὸν</span> … “let us therefore go out to him outside the camp bearing his reproach”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-26.htm" title="Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.">Hebrews 11:26</a>. Do not shrink from abandoning your old associations and being branded as outcasts and traitors and robbed of your privileges as Jews. This is the reproach of Christ, in bearing which you come nearer to Him. And the surrender of your privileges need not cost you too much regret, “for we have not here (on earth) an abiding city, but seek for that which is to be,” that which has the foundations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm" title="For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.">Hebrews 11:10</a>, the heavenly Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>. That which is spiritual and eternal satisfies the ambition and fills the heart. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-35.htm" title="For whoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.">Mark 3:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>.

At this time the ecclesiastical organisation was still unfixed. The vague term “leaders” (found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>), like the phrase “those set over you” (<span class="ital">proistamenoi</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>) means “bishops” and “presbyters,” the two terms being, in the Apostolic age, practically identical. In later ecclesiastical Greek this word (<span class="greekheb">ἡγούμενοι</span>) was used for “Abbots.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation</span>] In the emphatic order of the original, “and earnestly contemplating the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the end</span>] Not the ordinary word for “end” (<span class="ital">telos</span>) but the very unusual word <span class="ital">ekbasin</span>, “outcome.” This word in the N.T. is found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>, where it is rendered “escape.” In <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-17.htm" title="Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.">Wis 2:17</a> we find, “Let us see if his words be true, and let us see what shall happen at his end” (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐκβάσει</span>). It here seems to mean <span class="ital">death</span>, but not necessarily a death by martyrdom. It merely means “imitate them, by being faithful unto death.” The words <span class="ital">exodos</span>, “departure” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm" title="Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.">Luke 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2 Peter 1:15</a>) and <span class="ital">aphixis</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm" title="For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.">Acts 20:29</a>) are similar euphemisms for death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm" title="Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.">Hebrews 13:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡγουμένων</span>) <span class="ital">them who have the rule</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm" title="Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.">Hebrews 13:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-24.htm" title="Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.

The word is similarly used by St. Luke (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-26.htm">Luke 22:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>; also below, ver. 17 and ver. 24). St. Paul, with a like meaning, calls the rulers of the Church <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>), <span class="cmt_word">who spake to you the Word of God; of whose conversation</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. course of life</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>considering the end</span> (or <span class="accented">issue</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">imitate their faith.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus Christ is yesterday and today the same, and forever.</span> This allusion to departed leaders shows the comparatively late date of the Epistle. Those who had died as martyrs, and hence, having a peculiar halo round them in the issue of their lives, may be supposed to be especially referred to; such as Stephen the proto-martyr at Jerusalem, James the son of Zebedee, and possibly James the Just, the acknowledged leader of the Jewish Christians. It may be that Peter, the apostle of the circumcision, had also suffered before the writing of the Epistle. This supposition, however, which would involve a date for the Epistle after St. Paul's death also, is by no means necessary. Others, too, may be alluded to of whom we have no record, but whose memory would be fresh in the minds of the readers. But it does not follow that martyrs only are intended. Others also who had died in peace, and whose end had been blessed, might be pointed to as models for the imitation of survivors. Ver. 8 must be taken as a distinct appended sentence, the watchword on which the preceding exhortation is based. Its drift is that, though successive generations pass away, Jesus Christ remains the same - the Savior of the living as well as of the departed, and the Savior of all to the end of time. It may be here observed that, though his eternal Deity is not distinctly expressed - for "yesterday" does not of necessity reach back to past eternity - yet the sentence can hardly be taken as not implying it. For his unchangeableness is contrasted with the changing generations of men, as is that of Jehovah in the Old Testament (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2-4</a>), and surely such language would not have been used of any but a Divine Being. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Remember them which have the rule over you (&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Remember, with a view to observing their admonitions.
