As there we read of a divine sovereignty, so here of the work of creation, the power to change all created things, the divine attribute of changeless existence. This quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/102-25.htm" title="Of old have you laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of your hands.">Psalm 102:25-27</a> agrees almost exactly with the text of the LXX. as we have it in the Alexandrian MS., except that the words “as a garment” (not found in the Psalm) must here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-12.htm" title="And as a clothing shall you fold them up, and they shall be changed: but you are the same, and your years shall not fail.">Hebrews 1:12</a>) be added, according to our best authorities. The only point of any difficulty in these verses is that the writer discovers a testimony to the supremacy of the Son in words which, as they stand in the Psalm, would appear to be directly addressed to God as Creator. If, however, the Psalm be examined, it will be found (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13-14</a>) to contain the expression of hopes which in reality were inseparably united with the fulfilment of the Messianic promise. “The Lord shall appear to build up Zion:” this is the Psalmist’s theme, and it is to the same Lord that he addresses the words which are quoted here. As in Jesus the Christian Jew saw Him who fulfilled all these promises of God to His people, the application of the words of adoration to the same Lord would at once be recognised as true.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-10.htm" title="And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:...">Hebrews 1:10-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And thou, Lord, in the beginning, </span>&c. — These words, with those contained in the two following verses, are quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/102-25.htm" title="Of old have you laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of your hands....">Psalm 102:25-27</a>, where they are evidently spoken of the God of Israel, the living and true God. “Some have thought they are here addressed to the Father, and not to the Son. But, as the former passages are directed to the Son, it is reasonable to suppose this is so likewise: especially as it would not have been to the apostle’s purpose to quote it here, if it had been addressed to the Father. By affirming that these words were spoken to the Son, the apostle confuted the opinion of those Jews who held that the angels assisted in making this mundane system; an error which was afterward maintained by some heretics in the Christian Church. <span class="ital">They </span>— Permanent as they seem, and though firmly founded; <span class="ital">shall </span>at length <span class="ital">perish </span>— Of the perishing of the earth and aerial heavens, Peter speaks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up....">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>, where he also foretels that there shall be new heavens and a new earth, formed for the habitation of the righteous, after the old creation is destroyed. <span class="ital">But thou remainest </span>— <span class="greekheb">Διαμενεις</span>, <span class="ital">continuest </span>in undecaying glory; <span class="ital">as a vesture </span>— <span class="greekheb">Περιβολαιον</span>, a mantle, upper garment, or cloak; <span class="ital">shalt </span>thou <span class="ital">fold them up </span>— With infinite ease; <span class="ital">and they shall be changed </span>— Into new heavens and a new earth; or thou shalt remove them out of their place, and introduce a new scene of things with as much ease as a prince lays aside one robe and puts on another. <span class="ital">But </span>thou <span class="ital">art </span>eternally <span class="ital">the same, and thy years shall not fail </span>— Through everlasting ages, nor can thy perfections admit any possible diminution. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:4-14 Many Jews had a superstitious or idolatrous respect for angels, because they had received the law and other tidings of the Divine will by their ministry. They looked upon them as mediators between God and men, and some went so far as to pay them a kind of religious homage or worship. Thus it was necessary that the apostle should insist, not only on Christ's being the Creator of all things, and therefore of angels themselves, but as being the risen and exalted Messiah in human nature, to whom angels, authorities, and powers are made subject. To prove this, several passages are brought from the Old Testament. On comparing what God there says of the angels, with what he says to Christ, the inferiority of the angels to Christ plainly appears. Here is the office of the angels; they are God's ministers or servants, to do his pleasure. But, how much greater things are said of Christ by the Father! And let us own and honour him as God; for if he had not been God, he had never done the Mediator's work, and had never worn the Mediator's crown. It is declared how Christ was qualified for the office of Mediator, and how he was confirmed in it: he has the name Messiah from his being anointed. Only as Man he has his fellows, and as anointed with the Holy Spirit; but he is above all prophets, priests, and kings, that ever were employed in the service of God on earth. Another passage of Scripture, Ps 102:25-27, is recited, in which the Almighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared, both in creating the world and in changing it. Christ will fold up this world as a garment, not to be abused any longer, not to be used as it has been. As a sovereign, when his garments of state are folded and put away, is a sovereign still, so our Lord, when he has laid aside the earth and heavens like a vesture, shall be still the same. Let us not then set our hearts upon that which is not what we take it to be, and will not be what it now is. Sin has made a great change in the world for the worse, and Christ will make a great change in it for the better. Let the thoughts of this make us watchful, diligent, and desirous of that better world. The Saviour has done much to make all men his friends, yet he has enemies. But they shall be made his footstool, by humble submission, or by utter destruction. Christ shall go on conquering and to conquer. The most exalted angels are but ministering spirits, mere servants of Christ, to execute his commands. The saints, at present, are heirs, not yet come into possession. The angels minister to them in opposing the malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting and keeping their bodies, instructing and comforting their souls, under Christ and the Holy Ghost. Angels shall gather all the saints together at the last day, when all whose hearts and hopes are set upon perishing treasures and fading glories, will be driven from Christ's presence into everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And - That is, "To add another instance;" or, "to the Son he saith in another place, or in the following language." This is connected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>. "Unto the Son he saith <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>, Thy throne," etc. - and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a> he "also" saith, "Thou Lord," etc. That this is the meaning is apparent, because:<p>(1) the "object" of the whole quotation is to show the exalted character of the Son of God, and,<p>(2) an address here to Yahweh would be wholly irrelevant. Why, in an argument designed to prove that the Son of God was superior to the angels, should the writer break out in an address to Yahweh in view of the fact that he had laid the foundations of the world, and that he himself would continue to live when the heavens should be rolled up and pass away? Such is not the manner of Paul or of any other good writer, and it is clear that the writer here designed to adduce this as applicable to the Messiah. Whatever difficulties there may be about the principles on which it is done, and the reason why This passage was selected for the purpose, there can be no doubt about the design of the writer. He meant to be understood as applying it to the Messiah beyond all question, or the quotation is wholly irrelevant, and it is inconceivable why it should have been made. "Thou Lord." This is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-27</a>. The quotation is made from the Septuagint with only a slight variation, and is an accurate translation of the Hebrew. In the Psalm, there can be no doubt that Yahweh is intended. This is apparent on the face of the Psalm, and particularly because the "name" Yahweh is introduced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>, and because He is addressed as the Creator of all things, and as immutable. No one, on reading the Psalm, ever would doubt that it referred to God, and if the apostle meant to apply it to the Lord Jesus it proves most conclusively that he is divine. In regard to the difficult inquiry why he applied this to the Messiah, or on what principle such an application can be vindicated, we may perhaps throw some light by the following remarks. It must be admitted that probably few persons, if any, on reading the "Psalm," would suppose that it referred to the Messiah; but:<p>(1) the fact that the apostle thus employs it, proves that it was understood in his time to have such a reference, or at least that those to whom he wrote would admit that it had such a reference. On no other principle would he have used it in an argument. This is at least of some consequence in showing what the prevailing interpretation was.<p>(2) it cannot be demonstrated that it had no such reference, for such was the habit of the sacred writers in making the future Messiah the theme of their poetry, that no one can prove that the writer of this Psalm did not design that the Messiah should be the sub ject of his praise here.<p>(3) there is nothing in the Psalm which may not be applied to the Messiah; but there is much in it that is especially applicable to him. Suppose, for example, that the Psalmist <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-1.htm">Psalm 102:1-11</a>, in his complaints, represents the people of God before the Redeemer appeared - as lowly, sad, dejected, and afflicted - speaking of himself as one of them, and as a fair representative of that people, the remainder of the Psalm will well agree with the promised redemption. Thus, having described the sadness and sorrow of the people of God, he speaks of the act that God would arise and have mercy upon Zion <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-13.htm">Psalm 102:13-14</a>, that the pagan would fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth would see his glory <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-15.htm">Psalm 102:15</a>, and that when the Lord should build up Zion, he would appear in his glory; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-16.htm">Psalm 102:16</a>. To whom else could this be so well applied as to the Messiah? To what time so well as to his time? Thus, too in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-20.htm">Psalm 102:20</a>, it is said that the Lord would look down from heaven "to hear the groaning of the prisoner, and to loose them that are appointed to death" - language remarkably resembling that used by Isaiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which the Saviour applies to himself, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17-21</a>. The passage then quoted by the apostle <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-27</a> is designed to denote the "immutability" of the Messiah, and the fact that in him all the interests of the church were safe. He would not change. He had formed all things, and he would remain the same. His kingdom would be permanent amidst all the changes occurring on earth, and his people had no cause of apprehension or alarm; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-28.htm">Psalm 102:28</a>.<p>(4) Paul applies this language to the Messiah in accordance with the doctrine which he had stated <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, that it was by him that God "made the worlds." Having stated that, he seems to have felt that it was not improper to apply to him the passages occurring in the Old Testament that speak of the work of creation. The argument is this, "He was in fact the creator of all things." But to the Creator there is applied language in the Scriptures which shows that he was far exalted above the angels. He would remain the same, while the heavens and the earth should fade away. His years are enduring and eternal. "Such" a being must be superior to the angels; such a being must be divine. The words "Thou Lord" - &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;  su Kurie - are not in the Hebrew of the Psalm, though they are in the Septuagint. In the Hebrew, in the Psalm (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-24.htm">Psalm 102:24</a>,), it is an address to God - "I said, O my God" - &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;  'Eeliy - but there can be no doubt that the Psalmist meant to address Yahweh, and that the word "God" is used in its proper sense, denoting divinity; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-12.htm">Hebrews 1:12</a>, of the Psalm. "In the beginning;" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>.<p>When the world was made; compare notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>, where the same phrase is applied to the Messiah - "In the beginning was the word, where the same phrase is applied to the Messiah - "In the beginning was the word." "Hast laid the foundation of the earth." Hast made the earth. This language is such as is common in the Scriptures, where the earth is represented as laid on a foundation, or as supported. It is figurative language, derived from the act of rearing an edifice. The meaning here is, that the Son of God was the original creator or founder of the universe. He did not merely arrange it out of pre-existing materials, but he was properly its creator or founder. "And the heavens are the works of thine hands." This must demonstrate the Lord Jesus to be divine. He that made the vast heavens must be God. No creature could perform a work like that; nor can we conceive that power to create the vast array of distant worlds could possibly be delegated. If that power could be delegated, there is not an attribute of Deity which may not be, and thus all our notions of what constitutes divinity would be utterly confounded. The word "heavens" here, must mean all parts of the universe except the earth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. The word "hands" is used, because it is by the hands that we usually perform any work. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

T. <span class="greekheb">κύριος</span>,” these passages naturally prove nothing, since the usual practice is never the constant and invariable practice. When Delitzsch further adds: “such perversity originating in ignorance is not to be laid to the charge of an author who shows so deep an insight into the innermost core of the O. T.,” that is a prejudiced verdict, arising from subjectivity and dogmatic partiality, to the establishing of which it would have been necessary first of all to bring forward the proof that the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews in reality possessed an accurate knowledge not only of the Greet text of the LXX., but also of the original text of the O.

He is also of opinion that the writer considers that the words were spoken by Jehovah and that <span class="greekheb">κύριε</span>, therefore, must be the Messiah. This is possible, but it is not necessary for the justification of the Messianic reference. This follows from the character of the psalm, which predicts the manifestation of Jehovah as the Saviour of His people, even though this may only be in the far future (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-13.htm" title="Like as a father pities his children, so the LORD pities them that fear him.">Psalm 103:13</a> : “Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion.… So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, etc.”) Prof. B. W. Bacon of Yale has investigated this matter afresh and finds that, so far from the application of these verses to the Messiah being an audacious innovation, or even achieved, as Calvin says, “pia deflectione,” “the psalm itself was a favourite resort of those who sought in even pre-Christian times for proof-texts of Messianic eschatology”; also that “we have specific evidence of the application of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/102-23.htm" title="He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days....">Psalm 102:23-24</a> to the Messiah by those who employed the Hebrew or some equivalent text” and finally that by the rendering of <span class="greekheb">ענה</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-24.htm" title="I said, O my God, take me not away in the middle of my days: your years are throughout all generations.">Psalm 102:24</a> (English <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-23.htm" title="He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.">Psalm 102:23</a>) by <span class="ital">respondit</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκρίθη</span> “we have the explanation of how, in Christian circles at least, the accepted Messianic passage could be made to prove the doctrine that the Messiah is none other than the pre-existent wisdom of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old....">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>, “through whom,” according to our author, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>, “God made the worlds.” Indeed, we shall not be going too far if with Bruce we say: “It is possible that the writer (of Heb.) regarded this text (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/102-25.htm" title="Of old have you laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of your hands....">Psalm 102:25-27</a>) as Messianic because in his mind creation was the work of the pre-existent Christ. But it is equally possible that he ascribed creative agency to Christ out of regard to this and other similar texts believed to be Messianic on other grounds.” See Preuschen’s <span class="ital">Zeitschrift für N.T.

The word “Lord” is not in the original, but it is in the LXX.; and the Hebrew Christians who already believed that it was by Christ that “God made the world” (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>) would not dispute the Messianic application of these words to Him. They are a prayer of the afflicted written at some late period of the exile. Calvin (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>) goes so far as to say of such passages that the Apostle “by a pious diversion of their meaning (<span class="ital">piâ deflectione</span>) accommodates them to the Person of Christ.” The remark illustrates the courageous honesty and stern good sense of the great Reformer; but no Jewish-Christian exegete would have thought that he was practising a mere pious misapplication of the sacred words, or have admitted the objection of Cardinal Cajetan that “in a matter of such importance it was unbecoming to use such an argument.” The writer’s object is not <span class="ital">proof</span>—which was for his readers unnecessary; he wished to <span class="ital">illustrate</span> acknowledged truths by admitted principles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the beginning</span>] Heb. <span class="greekheb">לְפָנִים</span>, “face-wards,” i.e. of old.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm" title="And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:">Hebrews 1:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>) This particle connects the testimonies.—<span class="greekheb">σὺ κατʼ ἀρχὰς</span>—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐκλείψουσι</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/102-26.htm" title="They shall perish, but you shall endure: yes, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a clothing shall you change them, and they shall be changed:...">Psalm 102:26-28</a>; LXX. <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἀρχὰς σὺ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κύριε</span>, <span class="greekheb">τἡν γῆν</span>, etc., the remainder in the same words.

The psalm is entitled, "A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD." It seems likely, from its contents, to have been written by some suffering saint during the Babylonian captivity: for its purport is a prayer, rising into confident expectation for deliverance from a state of deep affliction, Israel being in captivity and Jerusalem in ruins. The prayed-for and expected deliverance, portrayed in vers. 16-24, corresponds so closely, both in thought and expression, with that pictured in the latter chapters of Isaiah (beginning at Hebrews 40.),that we cannot hesitate in assigning the same meaning to both. There is, for instance, the looking down of the Loan from. heaven to behold the affliction of his people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>); the setting free of captives (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>); the rebuilding and restoration of Zion, and in connection with this the conversion of the Gentiles to serve the Lore) with Israel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>. - 66; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>). These are specimens of the general correspondence between the two pictures, which must be evident to all who have studied both. But the ultimate reference of Isaiah's prophecy is certainly Messianic: wherefore that of the psalm may be concluded to be the same. And thus we have made one step in explanation of the applicability of this quotation to the argument of the Epistle in confirming its ultimate reference to the Messiah's advent; to the final realization of the ideal of the Son, typified by theocratic kings. But we have still to account for the apparent application to the Son of what, in the original psalm, shows no sign of being addressed to him. One view is that there is no intention in the Epistle of quoting it as addressed to him, the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (as has been seen) not of necessity implying such intention. According to this view, the point of the quotation is that the Messianic salvation is made to rest solely on the eternity and immutability of God - of him who, as he created all at first, so, though heaven and earth should pass away, remains unchanged. And the character of the salvation, thus regarded, is conceived to carry with it the transcendent super-angelic dignity of its accomplisher, the SON. So, in effect, Ebrard, who dwells on this as one example of the general character of apostolical exegesis, as opposed to rabbinical, in that, instead of drawing inferences, often arbitrary, from isolated words or phrases, the apostolic interpreters draw all their arguments from <span class="accented">the spirit</span> of the passages <span class="accented">considered in their connection</span> and this with a depth of intuition peculiar to themselves. Other commentators consider it more consistent with both the context and the argument to see, in the Epistle at least, an intended address to the Son. If this be so, our conclusion must be that this application of the psalmist's words is the inspired writer's own; since it is certainly not apparent in the psalm. It by no means follows that the writer of the Epistle foisted, consciously or unconsciously, a false meaning into the psalm. Even apart from the consideration of his being an inspired contributor to the New Testament canon, he was too learned in Scripture, and too able a reasoner, to adduce an evidently untenable argument. He may be understood as himself applying the passage in a way which he does not mean to imply was intended by the psalmist. His drift may be, "You have seen how in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>. the Son is addressed as God, and as having an eternal throne. Yea, so Divine is he that the address to the everlasting God himself in another psalm prophetic of his advent may be truly recognized as an address to him." Whichever view we take of this difficult passage, this at any rate is evident - that the inspired writer of the Epistle, apart from the question of the relevancy of quotation in the way of argument, associated Christ in his own mind with the unchangeable Creator of all things. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Sixth quotation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10-12</a>), exhibiting the superior dignity of the Son as creator in contrast with the creature. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26-28</a>.
