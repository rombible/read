In the Old Testament the token of the divine presence is the Shechinah, the “cloud of glory” (called “the glory” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a> in this Epistle); here it is the divine nature itself that is denoted by the “glory.” Of the relation between this word and that which follows (“substance”) it is difficult to speak, as the conceptions necessarily transcend human language; but we may perhaps say (remembering that all such terms are but figurative) that the latter word is internal and the former external,—the latter the essence in itself, the former its manifestation. Thus the “Son” in His relation to “God” is represented here by light beaming forth from light, and by exact impress—the perfect image produced by stamp or seal. These designations, relating to the essential nature of the Son, have no limitation to time; the participle “being” must be understood (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>) of eternal, continuous existence. The word “person” is an unfortunate mistranslation in this place. Most of the earlier English versions have “substance,” <span class= "ital">person</span> being first introduced in the Genevan Testament in deference to Beza.<p><span class= "bld">By the word.</span>—The thought seems suggested by Genesis 1. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm" title="For he spoke, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.">Psalm 33:9</a>); the spoken word was the expression of His power. What is said above of “being” applies to “upholding,” except that the latter implies a previous creative act.<p><span class= "bld">When he had by himself purged our sins.</span>—The older MSS. omit “by Himself” and “our,” so that the words must be rendered, <span class= "ital">when He had made purification of sins.</span> At first the change may seem a loss; but it is easily seen that the simpler statement is more majestic, and also more suitable in this place; the more complete explanation of the truth belongs to a later stage (Hebrews 9). To “make purification of sins” is an unusual phrase (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-3.htm" title="And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.">Matthew 8:3</a>, “his leprosy was cleansed”), meaning, to make purification by the removal of sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1John 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2Peter 1:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-62.htm" title="And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Mark 14:62</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a>. This figure, which we meet with more than twenty times in the New Testament, is throughout derived from the first words of Psalms 110, which are descriptive of the exaltation of the Messiah. Jehovah’s investiture of the Son of Man with unlimited dominion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>) and supreme dignity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>); the Saviour’s rest after the accomplishment of His work on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>); His waiting for the complete and final subjection of His enemies, are the ideas signified.

This glory indeed was veiled in flesh when he became incarnate, yet he still possessed it, and it shone forth, in some degree, on many occasions, especially at his transfiguration, and even in his whole ministry; infinite wisdom manifesting itself in his discourses; almighty power in his miracles; unspeakable love in his benevolent actions; and holiness unparalleled in his spirit and conduct daily. So that he was fitly denominated <span class="ital">the Holy One of God. And the express image </span>— Stamp or delineation; <span class="ital">of his person </span>— Or <span class="ital">substance, </span>as <span class="greekheb">υποστασεως </span>signifies. That is, he is one who has the whole nature of God in him, as he is his eternal Son; and declares and represents, in a most conspicuous manner, the divine properties to our faith and contemplation as incarnate: whatever the Father is, is exhibited in the Son as a seal in the stamp on wax. For the word <span class="greekheb">χαρακτηρ</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">express image, </span>properly signifies an image made by engraving, such as that on a seal; also the image which the seal makes on wax by impression. Phavorinus says, it is <span class="greekheb">διατυπωσις δηλουσα την υποστασιν</span>, <span class="ital">a form, </span>or <span class="ital">draught, manifesting the substance whence it was taken. </span>And the word <span class="greekheb">υποστασις</span>, rendered <span class="ital">person, </span>he says, is <span class="greekheb">ουσια μετα των ιδιωματων</span>, <span class="ital">the substance with the properties. </span>So that the clause here, according to him, is <span class="ital">a draught manifesting, </span>or <span class="ital">exhibiting the substance and properties of God. </span>“According to the Greek commentators on the place,” says Whitby, “it is the same with our Lord’s being in the form of God before he took our nature on him.” See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>, where this is explained at large. <span class="ital">And upholding </span>— <span class="greekheb">Φερων</span>, <span class="ital">sustaining, </span>or <span class="ital">preserving </span>and <span class="ital">governing; all things </span>— Visible and invisible. This expression is parallel to 1 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">τα παντα εν αυτω συνεστηκε</span>, <span class="ital">by him all things consist. </span>According to Pierce, the meaning of both passages is, that as the Son gave being to all things, so he maintains them in being. <span class="ital">By the word of his power </span>— That is, by his powerful word: in the same divine manner in which all things were created; for he only spake, and they were done. <span class="ital">When he had by himself — </span>By the sacrifice of himself, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>,) without any Mosaic rites or ceremonies; <span class="ital">purged our sins — </span><span class="greekheb">Καθαρισμον ποιησαμενος</span>, <span class="ital">having effected a purification </span>of them, or made atonement to satisfy the demands of divine justice. In order to which it was necessary he should for a time divest himself of his glory. This is the fourth fact treated of in this epistle, namely, that the Author of the gospel laid down his life a sacrifice for sin; of which, when offered, God declared his acceptance, by setting Jesus at his own right hand. The gospel, therefore, hath a priesthood and sacrifice more efficacious than the priesthood and sacrifices of the law taken together. For an expiation made by a person so great in himself, and so dear to God as his own Son, and made by the appointment of God, could not but be acceptable to him; consequently it must be a sure foundation for that hope of pardon, by which the gospel encourages sinners to repent. <span class="ital">Sat down </span>— The Jewish priests stood while they ministered: Christ’s being said to sit down, therefore, denotes the consummation of his sacrifice: <span class="ital">on the right hand of the Majesty </span>— Of God; <span class="ital">on high — </span>In the highest heavens. The apostle’s meaning is, that our Lord, after his ascension, was invested in the human nature with that visible glory and power which he enjoyed with God before the world, as mentioned by himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>. Our Lord’s sitting down at the right hand of God is affirmed in this epistle no less than five different times, because it presupposes his resurrection from the dead, and implies his being put in possession of the highest authority in heaven, under the Father. Consequently it is a clear proof that he is really the Son of God. It must be observed, that in this chapter the apostle describes Christ’s glory chiefly as he is the Son of God; afterward, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm" title="But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?">Hebrews 2:6</a>, &c., the glory of the man Christ Jesus. He speaks indeed briefly of the former before his humiliation, but copiously after his exaltation; as from hence the glory he had from eternity began to be evidently seen. Both his purging our sins, and sitting on the right hand of God, are largely treated of in the seven following chapters.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 God spake to his ancient people at sundry times, through successive generations, and in divers manners, as he thought proper; sometimes by personal directions, sometimes by dreams, sometimes by visions, sometimes by Divine influences on the minds of the prophets. The gospel revelation is excellent above the former; in that it is a revelation which God has made by his Son. In beholding the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Lord Jesus Christ, we behold the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Father, Joh 14:7; the fulness of the Godhead dwells, not typically, or in a figure, but really, in him. When, on the fall of man, the world was breaking to pieces under the wrath and curse of God, the Son of God, undertaking the work of redemption, sustained it by his almighty power and goodness. From the glory of the person and office of Christ, we proceed to the glory of his grace. The glory of His person and nature, gave to his sufferings such merit as was a full satisfaction to the honour of God, who suffered an infinite injury and affront by the sins of men. We never can be thankful enough that God has in so many ways, and with such increasing clearness, spoken to us fallen sinners concerning salvation. That he should by himself cleanse us from our sins is a wonder of love beyond our utmost powers of admiration, gratitude, and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who being the brightness of his glory - This verse is designed to state the dignity and exalted rank of the Son of God, and is exceedingly important with reference to a correct view of the Redeemer. Every word which is employed is of great importance, and should be clearly understood in order to a correct apprehension of the passage. First, in what manner does it refer to the Redeemer? To his divine nature? To the mode of his existence before he was incarnate? Or to him as he appeared on earth? Most of the ancient commentators supposed that it referred to his divine dignity before he became incarnate, and proceed to argue on that supposition on the mode of the divine existence. The true solution seems to me to be, that it refers to him as incarnate, but still has reference to him as the incarnate "Son of God." It refers to him as Mediator, but not simply or mainly as a man. It is rather to him as divine - thus, in his incarnation, being the brightness of the divine glory, and the express image of God. That this is the correct view is apparent, I think, from the whole scope of the passage. The drift of the argument is, to show his dignity as "he has spoken to us" <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>, and not in the period antecedent to his incarnation. It is to show his claims to our reverence as sent from God - the last and greatest of the messengers which God bas sent to man. But, then it is a description of him "as he actually is" - the incarnate Son of God; the equal of the Father in human flesh; and this leads the writer to dwell on his divine, character, and to argue from that; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10-12</a>. I have no doubt, therefore, that this description refers to his divine nature, but it is the divine nature as it appears in human flesh. An examination of the words used will prepare us for a more clear comprehension of the sense. The word "glory" - &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;  doxa - means properly "a seeming, an appearance;" and then:<p>(1) praise, applause, honor:<p>(2) dignity, splendor, glory;<p>(3) brightness, dazzling light; and,<p>(4) excellence, perfection, such as belongs to God and such as there is in heaven.<p>It is probably used here, as the word -   &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;  kaabowd - is often among the Hebrews, to denote splendor, brightness, and refers to the divine perfections as resembling a bright light, or the sun. The word is applied to the sun and stars, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-40.htm">1 Corinthians 15:40-41</a>; to the light which Paul saw on the way to Damascus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-11.htm">Acts 22:11</a>; to the shining of Moses' face, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>; to the celestial light which surrounds the angels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-1.htm">Revelation 18:1</a>; and glorified saints, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31-32</a>; and to the dazzling splendor or majesty in which God is enthroned; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-8.htm">Revelation 15:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>. Here there is a comparison of God with the sun; he is encompassed with splendor and majesty; he is a being of light and of infinite perfection. It refers to "all in God" that is bright, splendid, glorious; and the idea is, that the Son of God is the "brightness" of it all.<p>The word rendered "brightness" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  apaugasma - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means properly "reflected splendor," or the light which emanates from a luminous body. The rays or beams of the sun are its "brightness," or that by which the sun is seen and known. The sun itself we do not see; the beams which flow from it we do see. The meaning here is, that if God be represented under the image of a luminous body, as he is in the Scriptures (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>), then Christ is the radiance of that light, the brightness of that luminary - Stuart. He is that by which we perceive God, or by which God is made known to us in his real perfections; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>. - It is by him only that the true character and glory of God is known to people. This is true in regard to the great system of revelation but it is especially true in regard to the views which people have of God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a> - "no man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him."<p>The human soul is dark respecting the divine character until it is enlightened by Christ. It sees no beauty, no glory in his nature - nothing that excites wonder, or that wins the affections, until it is disclosed by the Redeemer. somehow it happens, account for it as people may, that there are no elevating practical views of God in the world; no views that engage and hold the affections of the soul; no views that are transforming and purifying, but those which are derived from the Lord Jesus. A man becomes a Christian, and at once he has elevated, practical views of God. He is to him the most glorious of all beings. He finds supreme delight in contemplating his perfections. But he may be a philosopher or an infidel, and though he may profess to believe in the existence of God, yet the belief excites no practical influence on him; he sees nothing to admire; nothing which leads him to worship him; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>.<p>And the express image - The word used here - &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1;  charakte&#772;r - likewise occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It is that from which our word "character" is derived. It properly means a "engraving-tool;" and then something "engraved" or "stamped" - "a character" - as a letter, mark, sign. The image stamped on coins, seals, wax, expresses the idea: and the sense here is, that if God be represented under the idea of a substance, or being, then Christ is the exact resemblance of that - as an image is of the stamp or die. The resemblance between a stamp and the figure which is impressed is exact; and so is the resemblance between the Redeemer and God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>. "Who is the image of the invisible God."<p>Of his person - The word "person" with us denotes an individual being, and is applied to human beings, consisting of body and soul. We do not apply it to anything dead - not using it with reference to the body when the spirit is gone. It is applied to man - with individual and separate consciousness and will; with body and soul; with an existence separate from others. It is evident that it cannot be used in this sense when applied to God, and that this word does not express the true idea of the passage here. Tyndale renders it, more accurately, "substance." The word in the original - &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  hupostasis - whence our word "hypostasis," means, literally, a "foundation," or "substructure." Then it means a well-founded trust, firm expectation, confidence, firmness, boldness; and then "reality, substance, essential nature." In the New Testament, it is rendered "confident," or "confidence" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>; "substance" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>; and "person" in the passage before us. It is not used elsewhere. Here it properly refers to the essential nature of God - what distinguishes him from all other beings, and which, if I may so say, "constitutes him God;" and the idea is, that the Redeemer is the exact resemblance of "that." This resemblance consists, probably, in the following things - though perhaps the enumeration does not include all - but in these he certainly resembles God, or is his exact image:<p>(1) In his original mode of being, or before the incarnation. Of this we know little. But he had a "glory with the Father before the world was;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>. He was "in the beginning with God, and was God;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>. He was in intimate union with the Father, and was one with Him, in certain respects; though in certain other respects, there was a distinction. I do not see any evidence in the Scriptures of the doctrine of "eternal generation," and it is certain that that doctrine militates against the "proper eternity" of the Son of God. The natural and fair meaning of that doctrine would be, that there was a time when he had not an existence, and when he began to be, or was begotten. But the Scripture doctrine is, that he had a strict and proper eternity. I see no evidence that he was in any sense a "derived being" - deriving his existence and his divinity from the Father. The Fathers of the Christian church, it is believed, held that the Son of God as to his divine, as well as his human nature, was "derived" from the Father. Hence, the Nicene creed speaks of him as "begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made" - language implying derivation in his divine nature. They held, with one voice, that he was God (divine); but it was in this manner; see Stuart, Excursus III. on the Epistle to the Hebrews. But this is incredible and impossible. A derived being cannot in any proper sense be "God"; and if there is any attribute which the Scriptures have ascribed to the Saviour with special clearness, it is that of proper eternity; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>.<p>(Perhaps the doctrine of Christ's natural or eternal Sonship had been as well understood without the help of the term "generation," which adds nothing to our stock of ideas on the subject, and gives rise, as the above remarks prove, to objections which attach altogether to the "word," and from which the "doctrine" itself is free. In fairness however, it should be remembered that, like many other theological terms, the term in question, when applied to Christ's Sonship, is not to be understood in the ordinary acceptation, as implying derivation or extraction. It is used as making some approach to a proper term only, and in this case, as in others of like nature, it is but just to respect the acknowledged rule that when human phraseology is employed concerning the divine nature, all that is imperfect, all that belongs to the creature, is to be rejected, and that only retained which comports with the majesty of the Creator. It is on this very principle that Prof. Stuart, in his first excursus, and Trinitarians generally, have so successfully defended the use of the word "person" to designate a distinction in the Godhead. Overlooking this principle, our author deduces consequences from the doctrine of eternal generation, which do not properly belong to it, and which its advocates distinctly repudiate.<p>That doctrine cannot militate against the proper eternity of the Son, since, while it uses the term "generation," not "more human," but with every thing of human informity separated from it, it supplies also the adjunct "eternal." Whatever some indiscreet advocates of the eternal Sonship may have affirmed, it should never be forgotten, that the ablest friends equally with the author, contend that there is no "Derivation or communication of essence from the Father to the Son." "Although the terms "Father" and "Son" indicate a relation analogous to that among people, yet, as in the latter case, it is a relation between two material and separate beings, and in the former, is a relation in the same Spiritual essence, the one can throw no light upon the other; and to attempt to illustrate the one by the other is equally illogical and presumptuous. We can conceive the communication of a material essence by one material being to another, because it takes place in the generation of animals; but the communication of a spiritual, indivisible, immutable essence is altogether inconceivable, especially when we add, that the supposed communication does not constitute a different being, but takes place in the essences communicating."<p>Dick's Theology, vol. 2, page 71. It is readily allowed that the Fathers, and many since their times, have written unguardedly on this mysterious subject: but their errors, instead of leading us to reject the doctrine entirely, should lead us only to examine the Scriptures more fully, and form our opinions on them alone. The excellent author already quoted has well remarked: "I cannot conceive what object they have in view who admit the Divinity, but deny the natural Sonship of our Saviour, unless it be to get rid of the strange notions about communication of essence and subordination which have prevailed so much; and in this case, like too many disputants, in avoiding one extreme, they run into the other.")<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Our nature, as guilt-laden, could not, without our great High Priest's blood of atonement sprinkling the heavenly mercy seat, come into immediate contact with God. Ebrard says, "The mediation between man and God, who was present in the Most Holy Place, was revealed in three forms: (1) In sacrifices (typical propitiations for guilt); (2) In the priesthood (the agents of those sacrifices); (3) In the Levitical laws of purity (Levitical purity being attained by sacrifice positively, by avoidance of Levitical pollution negatively, the people being thus enabled to come into the presence of God without dying, De 5:26)" (Le 16:1-34).<p>sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high&#8212;fulfilling Ps 110:1.

Or "of glory"; of God the Father, the God of glory, and who is glory itself; so called on account of his glorious nature and perfections and because of the glorious manifestations of them in his works of creation and providence, and in the various dispensations of his grace, and especially in his Son; and because he is the author of all glory, in the creatures, in the whole world, in Christ as man and Mediator, and in his own people. Now Christ is the "brightness" of this, as he is God; he has the same glorious nature and perfections, and the same glorious names, as Jehovah, the Lord of glory, &amp;c. and the same glory, homage, and worship given him: the allusion is to the sun, and its beam or ray: so some render it "the ray of his glory"; and may lead us to observe, that the Father and the Son are of the same nature, as the sun and its ray; and that the one is not before the other, and yet distinct from each other, and cannot be divided or separated one from another: so the phrase , "the brightness of his glory", is used of the divine Being, in the Chaldee paraphrases (r); see the Apocrypha. <p>"For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.'' (Wisdom 7:26) <p>And the express image of his person; this intends much the same as the other phrase; namely, equality and sameness of nature, and distinction of persons; for if the Father is God, Christ must be so too; and if he is a person, his Son must be so likewise, or he cannot be the express image and character of him; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>. <p>And upholding all things by the word of his power; the Syriac version renders it, "by the power of his word", to the same sense, only inverting the words. The Targumist on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a> uses a phrase very much like this, of God, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain; because, adds he,   , "he bears", or "sustains all things by the arm of his power"; and the words are to be understood not of the Father, upholding all things by his essential and powerful Word, his Son; but of the Son himself, who upholds all creatures he has made; bears up the pillars of the universe; preserves every creature in its being, and supports it, and supplies it with the necessaries of life; rules and governs all, and providentially orders and disposes of all things in the world, and that by his all powerful will; which makes it manifest, that he is truly and properly God, and a very fit person to be a priest, as follows: <p>when he had by himself purged our sins; the Arabic and Ethiopic versions seem to refer this to God the Father, as if he, by Christ, made the expiation of sin, and then caused him to sit down at his right hand; but it belongs to the Son himself, who of himself, and by himself alone, and by the sacrifice of himself, made atonement for the sins of his people; which is meant by the purgation of them: he took their sins upon himself, and bore them, and removed them far away, and utterly abolished them, which the priests under the law could not do: and when he had so done, <p>he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; by "Majesty" is meant God the Father, to whom majesty belongs; who is clothed with it, and which is before him: and his "right hand" designs his power, greatness, and glory, and is expressive of the high honour Christ, as man, is possessed of; for his sitting here denotes the glorious exaltation of him in human nature, after his sufferings, and death, and resurrection from the dead; and shows that he had done his work, and was accepted, and was now enjoying rest and ease, honour and glory, in which he will continue; and the place of his session, as well as of the habitation of God, at whose right hand he sits, is on high, in the highest heavens. <p>(r) Targum in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.13. &amp; in Cant. v. 10. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who being the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> brightness of <i>his</i> glory, and the express image of his <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> person, and <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> upholding all things by the word of his power, <span class="cverse3">{3}</span> when he had by himself purged our sins, <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</span><p>(e) He in whom the glory and majesty of the Father shines, who is otherwise infinite, and cannot be under obligation.<p>(f) His Father's person.<p>(g) Sustains, defends and cherishes.<p>(3) The third part of the same proposition: The same Son executed the office of the High Priest in offering up himself, and is our only and most mighty Mediator in heaven.<p>(h) This shows that the savour of that his sacrifice is not only most acceptable to the Father, but also is everlasting, and furthermore how far this High Priest surpasses all the other high priests.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>.

The plural <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ὙΨΗΛΟῖς</span></span></span> is explained from the supposition of several heavens, in the highest of which the throne of the Divine Majesty was placed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[31] Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 159 f., 2d ed.; comp. also his remarks in the Commentary, p. 64 ff.) believes that the <span class="greekheb">ὢν ἀπαύγασμα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. and the <span class="greekheb">φέρων τὰ πάντα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. must be referred exclusively to the <span class="ital">exalted</span> Christ, but on untenable grounds. For from the consideration that <span class="greekheb">φέρων τε τὰ πάντα</span> “forms the most unambiguous contrast to the condition of Christ’s life in the flesh,” nothing is to be argued in favour of this view; because this contrast is equally to be supposed, when we understand these words alike of the premundane as of the exalted Christ. The further assertion, however, that in the case of a referring of <span class="greekheb">ὢν ἀπαύγασμα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. to that which Christ is apart from His humanity, the declaration ver. 3 must have been connected by means of <span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστιν</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ὤν</span>, is lacking in all grammatical support. For, so far as concerns the sense, there is no difference whatever between <span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστιν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὤν</span>; only regard for rhetorical euphony and the due rounding off of the periods determined the author upon expressing himself as he did.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὃς ὢ ἀπαύγασμα</span>.… “Who being effulgence of His glory and express image of His nature.” The relative <span class="greekheb">ὃς</span> finds its antecedent in <span class="greekheb">υἱῳ</span>, its verb in <span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισεν</span>; and the interposed participles prepare for the statement of the main verb by disclosing the fitness of Christ to be the revealer of God, and to make atonement. The two clauses, <span class="greekheb">ὢν</span> … <span class="greekheb">φέρων τε</span>, are closely bound together and seem intended to convey the impression that during Christ’s redemptive activity on earth there was no kenosis, but that these Divine attributes lent efficacy to His whole work. [On the difficulty of this conception see Gore’s <span class="ital">Bampton Lec.</span>, p. 266, and Carpenter’s <span class="ital">Essex Hall Lec.</span>, p. 87.] <span class="greekheb">ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀπαύγασμα</span> may mean either what is flashed forth, or what is flashed back: either “ray” or “reflection”. Calvin, Beza, Thayer, Ménégoz prefer the latter meaning. Thus Grotius has, “repercussus divinae majestatis, qualis est solis in nube”. The Greek fathers, on the other hand, uniformly adopt the meaning “effulgence”. Thus Theodoret <span class="greekheb">τὸ γὰρ ἀπαύγασμα καὶ ἐκ τοῦ πυρός ἐστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ σὺν τῷ πυρί ἐστι</span>· <span class="greekheb">καὶ αἴτιον μὲν ἔχει τὸ πῦρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀχώριστον δέ ἐστι τοῦ πυρός</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ τῷ πυρὶ δὲ ὁμοφυὲς τὸ ἀπαύγασμα</span>: <span class="greekheb">οὐκοῦν καὶ ὁ</span>, <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς τῷ πατρί</span>. So in the Nicene Creed <span class="greekheb">φῶς ἐκ φωτός</span>. “The word ‘efflulgence’ seems to mean not rays of light streaming from a body in their connection with that body or as part of it, still less the reflection of these rays caused by their falling upon another body, but rather rays of light coming out from the original body and forming a similar light-body themselves” (Davidson). So Weiss, who says that the “Strahlenglanz ein zweites Wesen erzeugt”. Philo’s use of the word lends colour to this meaning when he says of the human soul breathed into man by God that it was are <span class="greekheb">ἅτε τῆς μακαρίας καὶ τρισμακαρίας φύσεως ἀπαύγασμα</span>. So in India, Chaitanya taught that the human soul was like a ray from the Divine Being; God like a blazing fire and the souls like sparks that spring out of it. In the Arian controversy this designation of the Son was appealed to as proving that He is eternally generated and exists not by an act of the Father’s will but essentially. See Suicer, s.v. As the sun cannot exist or a lamp burn without radiating light, so God is essentially Father and Son. <span class="greekheb">τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ</span>. God’s glory is all that belongs to him as God, and the Son is the effulgence of God’s glory, not only a single ray but as Origen says: <span class="greekheb">ὅλης τῆς δόξης</span>. Therefore the Son cannot but reveal the Father. Calvin says: “Dum igitur audis filium esse splendorem Paternae gloriae, sic apud te cogita, gloriam Patris esse invisibilem, donec in Christo refulgeat”. As completing the thought of these words and bringing out still more emphatically the fitness of the Son to reveal, it is added <span class="greekheb">καὶ χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χαρακτήρ</span>, as its form indicates, originally meant the cutting agent [<span class="greekheb">χαράσσειν</span>], the tool or person who engraved. In common use, however, it usurped the place of <span class="greekheb">χάραγμα</span> and denoted the impress or mark made by the graving tool, especially the mark upon a coin which determined its value; hence, any distinguishing mark, identifying a thing or person, <span class="ital">character</span>. “Express image” translates it well. The mark left on wax or metal is the “express image” of the seal or stamp. It is a reproduction of each characteristic feature of the original. <span class="greekheb">ὑποστάσεως</span> rendered “person” in A.V.; “substance,” the strict etymological equivalent, in R.V. To the English ear, perhaps, “nature” or “essence” better conveys the meaning. It has not the strict meaning it afterwards acquired in Christian theology, but denotes all that from which the glory springs and with which indeed it is identical. [We must not confound the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> with the <span class="greekheb">ἀπαύγασμα</span> as Hofmann and others do. The <span class="greekheb">ὑπόστασις</span> is the nature, the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> its quality, the <span class="greekheb">ἀπαύγασμα</span> its manifestation.] There is in the Father nothing which is not reproduced in the Son, save the relation of Father to Son. Menegoz objects that though a mirror perfectly reflects the object before it and the wax bears the very image of the seal, the mirror and the wax have not the same nature as that which they represent. And Philo more than once speaks of man’s rational nature as <span class="greekheb">τύπος τις καὶ χαρακτὴρ θείας δυνάμεως</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">ἀπαύγασμα</span> of that blessed nature, see <span class="ital">Quod deter, insid.</span>, c. xxiii.; <span class="ital">De Opif. Mundi</span>, c. li. All that he means by this is, that man is made in God’s image. But while no doubt the primary significance of the terms used by the writer to the Hebrews is to affirm the fitness of Christ to reveal God, the accompanying expressions, in which Divine attributes are ascribed to Him, prove that this fitness to reveal was based upon community of nature. The two clauses, <span class="greekheb">ὂς</span> to <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, have frequently been accepted as exhibiting the Trinitarian <span class="ital">versus</span> the Arian and Sabellian positions; the Sabellians accepting the <span class="greekheb">ἀπαύγασμα</span> as representing their view of the modal manifestation of Godhead, the Arians finding it possible to accept the second clause, but neither party willing to accept both clauses—separate or individual existence of the Son being found in the figure of the seal, while identity of nature seemed to be affirmed in <span class="greekheb">ἀπαύγασμα</span>. [<span class="greekheb">ὑπόστασις</span> was derived from the Stoics who used it as the equivalent of <span class="greekheb">οὐσία</span>, that which formed the essential substratum, <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑποκείμενον</span>, of all qualities. The Greek fathers, however, understood by it what they termed <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον ὁμοούσιον</span> and affirmed that there were in the Godhead three <span class="greekheb">ὑποστάσεις</span>. The Latin fathers translating <span class="greekheb">ὑπόστασις</span> by <span class="ital">substantia</span> could not make this affirmation. Hence arose confusion until Gregory Nazianzen pointed out that the difference was one of words not of ideas, and that it was due to the poverty of the Latin language. See Suicer, s.v.; Bleek in <span class="ital">loc</span>.; Bigg’s <span class="ital">Christian Platonists</span>, p. 164–5; Dean Strong’s <span class="ital">Articles</span> in <span class="ital">J.T.S</span>. for 1901 on the History of the Theological term Substance; Calvin <span class="ital">Inst.</span>, i., 13, 2; Loofs’ <span class="ital">Leitfaden</span>, p. 109 note and p. 134.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">φέρων τε τὰ πάντα</span> … “and upholding all things by the word of His power”. The meaning of <span class="greekheb">φέρως</span> is seen in such expressions as that of Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-14.htm" title="I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.">Numbers 11:14</a> <span class="greekheb">οὐ δυνήσομαι ἐγὼ μόνος φέρειν πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον</span>, where the idea of being responsible for their government and guidance is involved. So in Plutarch’s <span class="ital">Lucullus</span>, 6, <span class="greekheb">φέρειν τὴν πόλιν</span> of governing the city. In Latin Cicero (<span class="ital">Proverbs Flac.</span>, 37) reminds his judges “sustinetis rempublicam humeris vestris”. See Bleek. In Rabbinic literature, as Schoettgen shows, God is commonly spoken of as “portans mundum,” the Hebrew word being <span class="greekheb">סָבַל</span>. In Philo, the Logos is the helmsman and pilot of all things (<span class="ital">De Cherub</span>.) <span class="greekheb">τῷ ῥήμαι</span>, by the expression of His power, by making His will felt in all created nature. The present, <span class="greekheb">φέρων</span>, seems necessarily to involve that during the whole of His earthly career, this function of upholding nature was being discharged. Probably the clause is inserted not merely to illustrate the dignity of the Son, but to suggest that the whole course of nature and history, when rightly interpreted, reveals the Son and therefore the Father. The responsibility of bringing the world to a praiseworthy issue depends upon Christ, and as contributing to this work His earthly ministry was undertaken. For the notable thing He accomplished as God’s Son, the use He made of his dignity and power, is expressed in the words, <span class="greekheb">καθαρισμὸν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτιῶν ποιησάμενος</span> “having accomplished purification of the sins”. This was as essential to the formation of the covenant as the ability rightly to represent God’s mind and will. This itself was the supreme revelation of God, and it was only after accomplishing this He could sit down at God’s right hand as one who had finished the work of mediating the eternal covenant. <span class="greekheb">ποιησάμενος</span>, the mid. voice, supersedes the necessity of <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἑαυτοῦ</span>. The aorist part. implies that the cleansing referred to was a single definite act performed before He sat down, and in some way preparatory to that Exaltation. The word receives explanation in subsequent passages of the Ep. vii. 27, ix. 12–14. <span class="greekheb">καθαρισμός</span> as used in LXX suggests that the cleansing referred to means the removal of guilt and its consciousness. The worshippers were fitted by cleansing to appear before God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισεν ἐνδεξιᾷ</span> … “sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high”. <span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισεν</span> seems to denote that the work undertaken by the Son was satisfactorily accomplished; while the sitting down <span class="greekheb">ἐν δεξιᾷ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. denotes entrance upon a reign. The source of the expression is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a> (cited <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-13.htm" title="For every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.">Hebrews 5:13</a>) where the Lord says to Messiah <span class="greekheb">κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου</span>, and this not only as introducing Him to the place of security and favour, but also of dignity and power. “The King’s right hand was the place of power and dignity, belonging to the minister of his authority and his justice, and the channel of his mercy, the Mediator in short between him and his people” (Rendall). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-17.htm" title="Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.">Psalm 80:17</a>. In contrast to the ever-growing and never complete revelation to the fathers, which kept the race always waiting for something more sufficing, there came at last that revelation which contained all and achieved all. But the expression not only looks backward in approval of the work done by the Son, but forward to the result of this work in His supremacy over all human affairs. <span class="greekheb">μεγαλωσύνη</span> is ascribed to God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-25.htm" title="And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.">Judges 1:25</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-3.htm" title="Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe you greatness to our God.">Deuteronomy 32:3</a> <span class="greekheb">δότε μεγαλωσύνην τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also Clem., <span class="ital">Ep.</span>, xvi. Here it is used to denote the sovereign majesty inherent in God (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-62.htm" title="And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Mark 14:62</a>). The words <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑψήλοις</span> are connected by Westcott and Vaughan with <span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισεν</span>. It is better, with Beza and Bleek, to connect them with <span class="greekheb">μεγαλωσύνης</span>, for while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>, where it is said He sat down on the throne <span class="ital">of God</span>, no further designation is needed; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>, as here, where it is said that He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty, it is felt that some further designation is needed and <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span> is added. No local region is intended, but supreme spiritual influence, mediation between God, the ultimate love, wisdom and sovereignty, and this world. This writer and his contemporary fellow-Christians, had reached the conviction here expressed, partly from Christ’s words and partly from their own experience of His power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">the brightness</span>] The substitution of “effulgence” for “brightness” in the Revised Version is not, as it has been contemptuously called, “a piece of finery,” but is a rendering at once more accurate and more suggestive. It means “efflux of light”—“Light of (i.e. from) Light” (“<span class="ital">effulgentia</span>” not “<span class="ital">repercussus</span>”) Grotius. It implies not only resemblance—which is all that is involved in the vague and misleading word “brightness,” which might apply to a mere <span class="ital">reflexion</span>:—but also “origin” and “independent existence.” The glory of Christ is the glory of the Father just as the sun is only revealed by the rays which stream forth from it. So the “Wisdom of Solomon” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>)—which offers many resemblances to the Epistle to the Hebrews, and which some have even conjectured to be by the same author—speaks of wisdom as “the effulgence of the everlasting light.” The word is also found in Philo where it is applied to man. This passage, like many others in the Epistle, is quoted by St Clement of Rome (<span class="ital">ad Cor.</span> 36).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of his glory</span>] God was believed in the Old Dispensation to reveal Himself by a cloud of glory called “the Shechinah,” and the Alexandrian Jews, in their anxious avoidance of all <span class="ital">anthropomorphism</span> and <span class="ital">anthropopathy</span>—i.e. of all expressions which attribute the human form and human passions to God—often substituted “the Glory” for the name of God. Similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2 Peter 1:17</a> the Voice from God the Father is a Voice “from the magnificent glory.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-55.htm" title="But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,">Acts 7:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-9.htm" title="And, see, the angel of the Lord came on them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.">Luke 2:9</a>. St John says “God is Light,” and the indestructible purity and impalpable essence of Light make it the best of all created things to furnish an analogy for the supersensuous light and spiritual splendour of the Being of God. Hence St John also says of the Word “we beheld His glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>); and our Lord said to Philip “he who hath seen Me hath seen the Father” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-29.htm" title="And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.">Luke 9:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the express image</span>] Rather, “the stamp” (<span class="ital">charactçr</span>). The R. V. renders this word by “very image” (after Tyndale), and in the margin by “impress.” I prefer the word “stamp” because the Greek “<span class="ital">charactçr</span>” like the English word “stamp,” may, according to its <span class="ital">derivation</span>, be used either for the <span class="ital">impress</span> or for the stamping-tool itself. This Epistle has so many resemblances to Philo that the word may have been suggested by a passage (Opp. i. 332) in which Philo compares man to a coin which has been stamped by the Logos with the being and type of God; and in that passage the word seems to bear this unusual sense of a “stamping-tool,” for it impresses a man with the mark of God. Similarly St Paul in the Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>)—which most resembles this Epistle in its Christology—called Christ “the image (<span class="ital">eikôn</span>) of the invisible God;” and Philo says, “But the word is the image (<span class="ital">eikôn</span>) of God, by Whom the whole world was created,” <span class="ital">De Monarch</span>, (Opp. ii. 225).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of his person</span>] Rather, “of His substance” or “essence.” The word <span class="ital">hypostasis, substantia</span> (literally that which “<span class="ital">stands under</span>”) is, in philosophical accuracy, the imaginary substratum which remains when a thing is regarded apart from all its accidents. The word “person” of our A. V. is rather the equivalent to <span class="ital">prosôpon</span>. <span class="ital">Hypostasis</span> only came to be used in this sense some centuries later. Perhaps “Being” or “Essence,” though it corresponds more strictly to the Greek <span class="ital">ousia</span>, is the nearest representative which we can find to <span class="ital">hypostasis</span>, now that “substance,” once the most abstract and philosophical of words, has come (in ordinary language) to mean what is solid and concrete. It is only too possible that the word “substance” conveys to many minds the very opposite conception to that which was intended and which alone corresponds to the truth. Athanasius says, “<span class="ital">Hypostasis</span> is <span class="ital">essence</span>” (<span class="greekheb">οὐσία</span>); and the Nicene Council seems to draw no real distinction between the two words. In fact the Western Church admitted that, in the Eastern sense, we might speak of <span class="ital">three hypostaseis</span> of the Trinity; and in the Western sense, of <span class="ital">one hypostasis</span>, because in this sense the word meant Essence. For the use of the word in the LXX. see Ps. 38:6, 88:48. It is curiously applied in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/16-21.htm" title="For thy sustenance declared thy sweetness unto thy children, and serving to the appetite of the eater, tempered itself to every man's liking.">Wis 16:21</a>. In the technical language of theology these two clauses represent the Son as co-eternal and co-substantial with the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upholding all things</span>] He is not only the Creative Word, but the Sustaining Providence. He is, as Philo says, “the chain-band of all things,” but He is also their guiding force. “In Him all things subsist” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>). Philo calls the Logos “the pilot and steersman of everything.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the word of his power</span>] Rather, “by the utterance (<span class="ital">rhemati</span>) of His power.” It is better to keep “word” for <span class="ital">Logos</span>, and “utterance” for <span class="ital">rhema</span>. We find “strength” (<span class="greekheb">κράτος</span>) and “force” (<span class="greekheb">ἰσχύς</span>) attributed to Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>, as “power” (<span class="greekheb">δύναμις</span>) here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when he had by himself purged our sins</span>] Rather, “after making purification of sins.” The “by Himself” is omitted by some of the best MSS. (<span class="greekheb">א</span>, A, B), and the “our” by many. But the notion of Christ’s <span class="ital">independent</span> action (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Php 2:7</a>) is involved in the middle voice of the verb. On the purification of our sins by Christ (in which there is perhaps a slight reference to the “Day of Atonement,” called in the LXX. “the Day of <span class="ital">Purification</span>,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm" title="And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.">Exodus 29:36</a>), see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1 Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm" title="But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.">2 Peter 1:9</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm" title="And why do you not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and you shall seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.">Job 7:21</a>, LXX.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sat down</span>] His glorification was directly consequent on His voluntary humiliation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-1.htm" title="Hold not your peace, O God of my praise;">Psalm 109:1</a>), and here the whole description is brought to its destined climax.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on the right hand</span>] As the place of honour comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>.

The LXX. sometimes went so far as to substitute for “God” the phrase “the <span class="ital">place</span>” where God stood (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>, LXX.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on high</span>] Literally, “in high places;” like “Glory to God <span class="ital">in the highest</span>,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm" title="Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.">Job 16:19</a>); and “in heavenly places,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-4.htm" title="The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty waves of the sea.">Psalm 93:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-5.htm" title="A good man shows favor, and lends: he will guide his affairs with discretion.">Psalm 112:5</a>).

The first participle and likewise the second, from the finite verb <span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισεν</span>, <span class="ital">sat down</span>, being the aorist, have the meaning of an imperfect tense, and may be resolved into <span class="ital">because</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὢν</span>, <span class="greekheb">φέρων τε</span>, <span class="ital">because</span> (inasmuch as) <span class="ital">He was, because</span> (inasmuch as) <span class="ital">He was upholding</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">ὢν</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>); but the third, as being without the particle <span class="greekheb">τὲ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>, cohering more closely with the same finite verb, is to be resolved into <span class="ital">after that:</span> <span class="greekheb">ποιησάμενος</span>, <span class="ital">after that He made</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὢν</span>—<span class="greekheb">φέρων τε</span>, <span class="ital">because</span> [inasmuch as] <span class="ital">He was—and upheld</span>) That glory, on which the Son entered when He was exalted to the right hand of the Father, no angel was capable of taking, but the Son took it; for He also had it formerly in respect of God, whose <span class="ital">glory shines refulgently</span> in Him, and in respect of <span class="ital">all things</span>, which He <span class="ital">upholds;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-62.htm" title="What and if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?">John 6:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm" title="I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.">Revelation 1:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπαύγασμα</span>, <span class="ital">the brightness</span>) <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-25.htm" title="For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her....">Wis 7:25-26</a> : <span class="ital">For she</span> (<span class="ital">wisdom</span>) <span class="ital">is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the</span> GLORY (<span class="greekheb">ΔΟΞΗΣ</span>) <span class="ital">of the Almighty: therefore no defiled thing falls into her.

If we gather from the LXX. the meaning of this word, variously used by them—never however concerning GOD—it denotes here the immoveable everlastingness of the Divine life and power; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-11.htm" title="They shall perish; but you remain; and they all shall wax old as does a garment;">Hebrews 1:11</a>.

In this chapter he describes the glory of Christ, in that light chiefly, as He is the Son of GOD; then subsequently he describes the glory of Christ as man, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm" title="But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?">Hebrews 2:6</a>. He mentions the actual glory of the Son of GOD before His humiliation in a summary manner; but His glory after His exaltation, most fully; for it was from this exaltation in particular, and not before, that the glory which He had from eternity began to be most clearly seen. And <span class="ital">the purging of our sins</span>, and subsequent <span class="ital">sitting on the right hand of the Majesty</span>, are most fully treated of in ch. 7, etc.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισεν</span>, <span class="ital">He sat down</span>) by the will of the Father; comp. <span class="greekheb">ἔθηκε</span>, <span class="ital">He appointed</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>.

This transcendent idea is conveyed by two metaphorical expressions, differing in the metaphors used, but concurrent in meaning. <span class="cmt_word">The brightness of his glory</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "glory"), though net in classical Greek carrying with it the idea of light, is used in the LXX. for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, which denotes the splendor surrounding God; manifested on Mount Sinai, in the holy of holies, in the visions of Ezekiel, etc.; and regarded as existing eternally "<span class="accented">above</span> the heavens" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-15.htm">Exodus 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7, 8</a>, etc.). But the full blaze of this glory, accompanying" the face" of God, even Moses was not allowed to see; for no man could see <span class="accented">him</span> and live. Moses was hidden in a cleft of the rock while the God's glory passed by, and saw only its outskirts, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the radiance left behind after it; had passed; hearing meanwhile a proclamation of the moral attributes of Deity, by a perception of which he might best see God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>, etc.). Similarly in the New Testament. There also, as on Sinai, in the tabernacle, and in prophetic vision, the glory of God is occasionally manifested under the form of an unearthly radiance; as in the vision of the shepherds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>), the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28</a>, etc.), the ecstasy of Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>). But in itself, as it surrounds "the face" of God, it is still invisible and unapproachable; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>, "<span class="accented">No</span> man hath seen God at any time;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>, "God is Light;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>, "<span class="accented">Dwelling</span> in the light which no man can approach unto (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), whom no man hath seen nor can see." It denotes really, under the image of eternal, self-existent, unapproachable light, the ineffable Divine perfection, the essence of Deity, which is beyond human ken. "Sempiterna ejus virtus et divinitas" (Bengel). Of this glory the SON is the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> - a word not occurring elsewhere in the New Testament, but used by the Alexandrian writers. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "<span class="accented">to</span> radiate," "to beam forth brightness;" and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, according to the proper meaning of nouns so formed, should mean the brightness beamed forth - this rather than its reflection from another object, as the sun's light is reflected from a cloud. So the noun is used in Wisd. 7:26, as applied to <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is there personified in a manner suggestive of the doctrine of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> And Philo speaks of the breath of life breathed lute man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> ('De Spec. Leg.,' &sect; 11). As, then, the eradiated brightness is to the source of light, so is the SON, in his eternal being, to the Father. It is, so to speak, begotten of the source, and of one substance with it, and yet distinguishable from it; being that through which its glory is made manifest, and through which it enlightens all things. The Person of the Son is thus represented, not as of one apart from God, irradiated by his glory, but as himself the sheen of his glory; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>. The above is the view taken by the Fathers generally, and expressed in the Church's Creed, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And express Image of his substance</span>; not "of his person," as in the A.V. The latter rendering is due to the long-accepted theological use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of <span class="accented">personal subsistence</span>, as applied to each of the Three in One. What the Latins called <span class="accented">persona</span> the Greeks at length agreed to call <span class="accented">hypostasis</span>, while the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">essentia</span>) and the Latin <span class="accented">substantia</span> (though the latter word etymologically corresponds with <span class="accented">hypostasis</span>) were used as equivalents in meaning. But it was long after the apostolic age that this scientific use of the word became fixed. After as well as before the Nicene Council <span class="accented">usia</span> was sometimes used to denote what we mean by <span class="accented">person</span>, and <span class="accented">hypostasis</span> to denote what we mean by the <span class="accented">substance</span> of the Godhead; and hence came misunderstandings during the Arian controversy. Bull ('Def. Fid. Nic.,' 2:9. 11) gives a catena of instances of this uncertain usage. The definite doctrine of the Trinity, though apparent in the New Testament, had not as yet come under discussion at the time of the writing of this Epistle, or been as yet scientifically formulated; and hence we must take the word in its general and original sense, the same as that now attached to its etymological equivalent, <span class="accented">substantia. It</span> means literally, "a standing under," and is used <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in a physical sense, for "foundation," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>, "I sink in deep mire where there is no standing," where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> metaphorically, for "confidence" or "certainty," as below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> metaphysically, for that which underlies the phenomena of things and constitutes their essential being. Of the <span class="accented">substance</span>, understood in the last sense, of God the Son is the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, which word expresses a similar kind of relation to the Divine substance as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> does to the Divine glory. Derived from <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (equivalent to "mark," "grave," or "stamp," with an engraven or imprinted character), its proper meaning is the perceptible image on the material so stamped or engraved, of which it thus becomes the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>. Thus the "image and superscription" on a coin is its <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, manifesting what the coin is. The instance of the tribute money (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-20.htm">Matthew 22:20</a>) at once occurs to us: our Lord pointed to the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> on the coin as manifesting its <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, as being Caesar's money. Thus also the lineaments of a countenance are called its <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, as in Herod., 1:116, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. A passage in Philo is illustrative of the sense intended; and it is to be observed (both with regard to the expression before us and to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) that the Alexandrian theologians are important guides to the interpretation of phrases in this Epistle, their influence on its modes of thought and expression being perceptible. He says ('De Plant. Nee.,' &sect; 5) that Moses called the rational soul the image (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Divine and Invisible, as being <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Here, be it observed, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> is used for the form or lineament of the Divine seal itself, not for the copy stamped on the plastic material. And it is applied, as here, to the "Eternal Word," as being the manifestation of what the unseen Godhead is. Hence it would be wrong to understand the word, as some have done, as denoting the form impressed by one substance on another - as though the impression left on the wax were the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> of the seal. This misconception would mislead (as might also <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, if rendered "reflection") in that it would seem to represent the Son as distinct from God, though stamped with his likeness and irradiated by his glory. Arian views about the SON, or even mere humanitarian views about the Christ, might thus seem countenanced. The two words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, as has been said, express a similar relation to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> respectively, and convey the same general idea of the Son's eternal relation to the Father. But both are, of course, but figures, each necessarily inadequate, of the inscrutable reality. If we may distinguish between them, it may be said that the former especially intimates the view of the operation and energy of the Godhead being through the Son, while the latter more distinctly brings out the idea of the Son being the Manifestation of what the God- head is, and especially of what it is to us. <span class="cmt_word">And upholding all things</span>. We have here still the present participle, denoting the intrinsic operation of him who was revealed as Son. Though the word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of upholding or sustaining creation, does not occur elsewhere in the, New Testament, it can hardly have any other meaning here, considering the context. We find a similar use of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-14.htm">Numbers 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, "<span class="accented">to bear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) all this people alone." And in the later Greek and rabbinical writers parallels are found. Chrysostom interprets <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> as meaning <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, which comes to the same thing as "upholding" or "sustaining." The meaning is that not only were "<span class="accented">the</span> worlds" made through him; in his Divine nature he ever "upholds" the "all things" which were made through him, and of which, as SON, he was appointed "Heir;" el. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>, "And in him all things consist." And this upholding operation must not be supposed to have been in abeyance during the period of his humiliation. He was still what he had been eternally, though he had "emptied himself" of the state and prerogatives of Deity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>); el. (though the text is somewhat doubtful) <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>, "The Son of man, which is (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>) in heaven." By the word (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) of his power is an expression elsewhere used of the <span class="accented">voluntas efficax</span> of Deity - the <span class="accented">utterance</span> of Divine power; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, "The worlds were framed by the Word (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) of God." The writer could hardly have used it in this connection, if speaking of a created being. As to the reference of "his" before" power," whether to the subject of the sentence or to God, there is the same ambiguity in the Greek as in the English translation. Even if <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> be intended, and not <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (and the former is most likely, since the pronoun, though it be reflective, is not emphatically so), it may with grammatical propriety refer either, like the previous <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, to God, or to him who thus upholds all things. In either case the general meaning of the clause remains the same. Enough has been said on the whole series of phrases which is thus concluded to show the untenableness of the Socinian interpretation, which would refer them only to Christ in the flesh and to the Christian dispensation. On such interpretation of the first of them Bull remarks, "Interpretatio Socinistarum, Deum nempe dici per Filiam saecula condidisse, quod per ipsum genus humanum reformavit et restauravit, et in novum quemdam statum transtulit, prodigiosum est commentum. Sane juramento aliquis tuto affirmare possit, ex Hebraeis, ad quos scripta fuit ilia epistola, ne unum quidem fuisse, qui scriptoris verba hoc sensu intellexerit, aut vel per somnium cogitaverit, per <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">saeculaa</span>, significarum fuisse tantum genus humanum, nedum ejus pattem illam, cui tunc temporis evangelii lux effulserat" ('Jud. Eccl. Cath.,' 5:8). <span class="cmt_word">When he had made purification of sins</span>. (So, according to the best-supported 'rod now generally accepted text.) The aorist is now resumed, denoting an act in time - the act accomplished by him as incarnate SON, previous to and necessary for his entering on the inheritance appointed to him as such. This act, the grand purpose of the Incarnation, was <span class="accented">atonement.</span> There can be no doubt that the cleansing effected by atonement, and not the mere <span class="accented">moral</span> reformation of believers, is meant here by <span class="accented">purification of sins</span>. The sequel of the Epistle, being, as aforesaid, the full expression of the drift of the exordium, is sufficient proof of this. For in it Christ is exhibited at great length as the true High Priest of humanity, accomplishing truly what the Jewish priesthood signified; and as having "sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the <span class="accented">heavens</span>," in virtue of his accomplished atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>). Nor would the Hebrew readers to whom the Epistle was addressed be likely to understand <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> ("purification") in any other sense than this. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the LXX. equivalent for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, frequent in the Old Testament for ceremonial cleansing, the result of atoning sacrifice; in which sense it is accordingly used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>. of this Epistle. The theory of the Jewish ceremonial law was that the whole congregation, including the priests themselves, were too much polluted by sin to approach the holy God who dwelt between the cherubim. Therefore sacrifices were ordained to make atonement for them. The word for "making atonement for" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, which means properly "to cover;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to cover sin from the sight of God. And the result of such atonement was called "purification," or "cleansing." This appears clearly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where the ceremonies of the great Day of Atonement are detailed. After an account of the various sacrifices of atonement, for the high <span class="accented">priest</span> and his house, for the people, and for the holy place itself polluted by their sins, we read (ver. 19), "And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the altar] with his finger seven times, and <span class="accented">cleanse it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), and hallow it from the <span class="accented">uncleanness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">of</span> the children of Israel." And finally (ver. 30), "For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to <span class="accented">cleanse</span> you (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), that ye may be <span class="accented">clean</span> from all your sins before the Lord." It is to be observed, further, that it is especially the meaning of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement that Christ is spoken of afterwards in the Epistle as having fulfilled. For the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Its meaning in the Epistle may be that Christ, by his death, brought into being and established a permanent purification of sins - "a fountain open for sin and for uncleanness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>) - in his blood, which is regarded as now ever offered at the heavenly mercy-seat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>) and sprinkled on the redeemed below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14, 22</a>). Thus the distinction, observed above, between the atonement (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), of sacrifice and its application for cleansing (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) would be preserved (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sat down</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> entered on his inheritance of all things; not simply in the sense of resuming his pristine glory, but of obtaining the preeminence denoted in prophecy as appointed to the Son, human as well as Divine, and won by obedience and accomplished atonement. And this his supreme exaltation (as will be seen hereafter) carries with it the idea of an exaltation of humanity, of which he was the High Priest and Representative. But be it observed that there is no change in the subject; of the sentence. He who "sat down on high" after making purification is the same with him through whom the worlds were made, and whose eternal Divinity has been expressed by the present participles. This identification supports the orthodox position of there being but one personality in Christ, notwithstanding the two natures, and justifies, against Nestorian-ism, the term <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;</span> applied to the blessed Virgin, with other cognate expressions accepted in orthodox theology, such as, "God suffered," though in his human, not his Divine, nature; "God shed his blood" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">On the right hand of the Majesty on high</span>. The expression is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, afterwards cited in this Epistle, and prominently referred to in like manner by St. Paul. The figure is suggested by the custom of Oriental kings, who placed at the right hand of the throne a son whom they associated with themselves in the prerogatives of royalty. Occurring as it does first in a Messianic psalm, the phrase is never applied to the Son's original relation to the Father "before the ages," but only to his exaltation as the Christ (on which see Bleek). The same idea seems expressed by our Lord's own words, "All authority hath been <span class="accented">given</span> unto me in heaven and in earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). But in the <span class="accented">end</span>, according to St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24, 28</a>), this peculiar "kingship" of the SON will cease, the redemptive purpose being accomplished. It is to be observed that, both here and afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>), a fine periphrasis is used for "right-hand of God;" "the right hand of the Majesty on high" and "the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." This may be regarded, not only as characteristic of the eloquent style of the Epistle, but also as implying an avoidance of too local or physical a view of the session spoken cf. It is apparent elsewhere how the writer sees in the figures used to denote heavenly things only signs, level to our comprehension, of corresponding realities beyond our ken. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Being (&#x3c9;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Representing absolute being.

Interpretation is divided between effulgence and reflection. Effulgence or outraying accords better with the thought of the passage; for the writer is treating of the preincarnate Son; and, as Alford justly remarks, "the Son of God is, in this his essential majesty, the expression and the sole expression of the divine light; not, as in his incarnation, its reflection." The consensus of the Greek fathers to this effect is of great weight. The meaning then is, that the Son is the outraying of the divine glory, exhibiting in himself the glory and majesty of the divine Being. "God lets his glory issue from himself, so that there arises thereby a light-being like himself" (Weiss). &#x394;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; glory is the expression of the divine attributes collectively. It is the unfolded fullness of the divine perfections, differing from &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; form of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>), in that &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768; is the immediate, proper, personal investiture of the divine essence. &#x394;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; is attached to deity. &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768; is identified with the inmost being of deity &#x394;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; is used of various visible displays of divine light and splendor, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-42.htm">Numbers 16:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-23.htm">Leviticus 9:23</a>, etc. We come nearer to the sense of the word in this passage in the story of Moses's vision of the divine glory, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>.<p>The express image of his person (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Rend the very image (or impress) of his substance The primary sense of &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; substance is something which stands underneath; foundation, ground of hope or confidence, and so assurance itself.

Upholding conveys too much the idea of the passive support of a burden. "The Son is not an Atlas, sustaining the dead weight of the world" (quoted by Westcott). Neither is the sense that of ruling or guiding, as Philo (De Cherub.  11), who describes the divine word as "the steersman and pilot of the all." It implies sustaining, but also movement. It deals with a burden, not as a dead weight, but as in continual movement; as Weiss puts it, "with the all in all its changes and transformations throughout the aeons." It is concerned, not only with sustaining the weight of the universe, but also with maintaining its coherence and carrying on its development. What is said of God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>, is here said or implied of Christ: &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; all things (collectively, the universe) consist or maintain their coherence in him. So the Logos is called by Philo the bond (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;) of the universe; but the maintenance of the coherence implies the guidance and propulsion of all the parts to a definite end. All things (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;) collectively considered; the universe; all things in their unity.

In carrying on all things toward their destined end of conformity to the divine archetype, the Son must confront and deal with the fact of sin, which had thrown the world into disorder, and drawn it out of God's order.
