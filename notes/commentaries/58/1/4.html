Two important questions have been asked:—(1) Does the writer adduce these quotations as strictly demonstrative? (2) If so, on what assumption does their relevancy rest? It is evident that the whole argument is addressed to men who believed that the Christ had appeared in the person of Jesus. Of the passages here cited some were already, by universal consent, applied to the Messiah. As to the others, it was sufficient if the trained and thoughtful reader could recognise the accuracy of such an application when once suggested. That in no case is there mere “accommodation” or illustration will, it is hoped, be made clear. On the other hand, the writer’s object is less to convince his readers of some <span class= "ital">new</span> truth than to draw attention to what the well-known passages really contain and express.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they....">Hebrews 1:4-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Being made </span>— Rather <span class="ital">being; </span>(for the word <span class="ital">made </span>is not implied in the original expression, <span class="greekheb">γενομενος</span>;) <span class="ital">so much better </span>— Higher; <span class="ital">than the angels </span>— As the Jews gloried exceedingly in the law of Moses, on account of its being delivered by the ministry of angels, the apostle proves, by passages from the Jewish Scriptures, that the Son is superior in nature and dignity to all the angelical hosts. How much more then may we glory in the gospel, which was given, not by the ministry of angels, but by the very Son of God. <span class="ital">As he hath by inheritance obtained </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">κεκληρονομηκην</span>, <span class="ital">he hath inherited; a more excellent name than they </span>— Namely, the name of <span class="ital">Son; </span>a name which he is said to inherit, because he really is God’s Son, and that in a sense in which no creature, man or angel, is his Song of Solomon 1 st, Not by adoption, regeneration, or title, as patriarchs, prophets, or any other saints might be his sons: for he is distinguished from all these, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-6.htm" title="Having yet therefore one son, his well beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will reverence my son.">Mark 12:6</a>. 2d, Not by the resurrection merely, by which the saints will hereafter be manifested to be the sons of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-36.htm" title="Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.">Luke 20:36</a>. For he was distinguished from Moses and Elias on the mount of transfiguration, who had both entered the immortal state, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-6.htm" title="And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.">Matthew 17:6</a>. 3d, Not by creation, as Adam was, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-38.htm" title="Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.">Luke 3:38</a>,) and angels are God’s sons; for he is here represented as having a right to the name of <span class="ital">Song of Solomon </span>by inheritance, which the angels have not. Hence he is termed <span class="ital">the only- begotten of the Father; </span>an expression which excludes from that honourable relation angels, and all other beings whatever. <span class="ital">For unto which of the angels</span> — Although sometimes termed in Scripture the sons of God, because created by him; <span class="ital">said he at any time, Thou art my Son </span>— God of God, Light of Light, the eternal Word of the eternal Father; <span class="ital">this day have I begotten thee </span>— Namely, in and from eternity; which, by its unalterable permanency of duration, is one continued unsuccessive day. See the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>. “It is true, because the angel said to his mother, <span class="ital">The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God; </span>some contend that these words, <span class="ital">Thou art my Son, </span>&c.; are a prediction of our Lord’s miraculous conception. But on that supposition the argument taken from the name falls: for instead of proving Jesus superior to angels, his miraculous conception does not make him superior to Adam, who was as much the immediate work of God as Christ’s human nature was the immediate work of the Holy Ghost. Besides, he is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-17.htm" title="For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.">John 3:17</a>) to have been the Son of God before he was sent into the world;” and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a> of this chapter, when the worlds were made by him.

Understood of the Messiah, it is a prediction that God would, in the most public manner, declare Jesus his Son by voices from heaven uttered on different occasions, and by the descent of the Holy Ghost on him after his baptism, and by his resurrection from the dead. Whereas the same promise spoken concerning Solomon, means only that he was to be the object of God’s especial affection and care. Accordingly it was so explained in the revelation to David himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>; <span class="ital">I will give him rest from all his enemies round about.

The appellation <span class="ital">first-begotten </span>includes that of <span class="ital">Son, </span>together with the rights of primogeniture, which the first-begotten Son of God enjoys, in a manner not communicable to any creature; <span class="ital">into the world </span>— Namely, at his incarnation; <span class="ital">he, </span>God, <span class="ital">saith, Let all the angels of God worship him — </span>So much higher was he, when in his lowest estate, than the highest angel! “In the Hebrew text it is <span class="ital">cal Elohim, </span>which in our Bibles is rendered <span class="ital">all ye gods. </span>But the expression is elliptical, and may be supplied as the writer of this epistle hath done; <span class="ital">all ye angels of God </span>— In the 97th Psalm, whence it is commonly thought this quotation is made, the establishment of the kingdom of Christ is foretold, together with its happy influence in destroying idolatry.

They looked upon them as mediators between God and men, and some went so far as to pay them a kind of religious homage or worship. Thus it was necessary that the apostle should insist, not only on Christ's being the Creator of all things, and therefore of angels themselves, but as being the risen and exalted Messiah in human nature, to whom angels, authorities, and powers are made subject. To prove this, several passages are brought from the Old Testament. On comparing what God there says of the angels, with what he says to Christ, the inferiority of the angels to Christ plainly appears. Here is the office of the angels; they are God's ministers or servants, to do his pleasure. But, how much greater things are said of Christ by the Father! And let us own and honour him as God; for if he had not been God, he had never done the Mediator's work, and had never worn the Mediator's crown. It is declared how Christ was qualified for the office of Mediator, and how he was confirmed in it: he has the name Messiah from his being anointed. Only as Man he has his fellows, and as anointed with the Holy Spirit; but he is above all prophets, priests, and kings, that ever were employed in the service of God on earth. Another passage of Scripture, Ps 102:25-27, is recited, in which the Almighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared, both in creating the world and in changing it. Christ will fold up this world as a garment, not to be abused any longer, not to be used as it has been. As a sovereign, when his garments of state are folded and put away, is a sovereign still, so our Lord, when he has laid aside the earth and heavens like a vesture, shall be still the same. Let us not then set our hearts upon that which is not what we take it to be, and will not be what it now is. Sin has made a great change in the world for the worse, and Christ will make a great change in it for the better. Let the thoughts of this make us watchful, diligent, and desirous of that better world. The Saviour has done much to make all men his friends, yet he has enemies. But they shall be made his footstool, by humble submission, or by utter destruction. Christ shall go on conquering and to conquer. The most exalted angels are but ministering spirits, mere servants of Christ, to execute his commands. The saints, at present, are heirs, not yet come into possession. The angels minister to them in opposing the malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting and keeping their bodies, instructing and comforting their souls, under Christ and the Holy Ghost. Angels shall gather all the saints together at the last day, when all whose hearts and hopes are set upon perishing treasures and fading glories, will be driven from Christ's presence into everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being made so much better - Being exalted so much above the angels. The word "better" here does not refer to moral character, but to exaltation of rank. As Mediator; as the Son of God in our nature, he is exalted far above the angels.<p>Than the angels - Than all angels of every rank; see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>. "Angels, and authorities, and powers being made subject unto him." He is exalted to his mediatorial throne, and all things are placed beneath his feet.<p>As he hath by inheritance - Or in virtue of his name - the Son of God; an exaltation such as is implied in that name. As a son has a rank in a family above servants; as he has a control over the property above that which servants have, so it is with the Mediator. He is the Son of God: angels are the servants of God, and the servants of the church. They occupy a place in the universe compared with what he occupies, similar to the place which servants in a family occupy compared with that which a son has. To illustrate and prove this is the design of the remainder of this chapter. The argument which the apostle insists on is, that the title "the Son of God is to be given to him alone. It has been conferred on no others. Though the angels, and though saints are called in general "sons of God," yet the title" the Son of God" has been given to him only. As the apostle was writing to Hebrews, he makes his appeal to the Hebrew Scriptures alone for the confirmation of this opinion.<p>A more excellent name - To wit, the name Son. It is a more honorable and exalted name than has ever been bestowed on them. It involves more exalted privileges, and entitles him on whom it is bestowed to higher respect and honor than any name ever bestowed on them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Being made &#8230; better&#8212;by His exaltation by the Father (Heb 1:3, 13): in contrast to His being "made lower than the angels" (Heb 2:9). "Better," that is, superior to. As "being" (Heb 1:3) expresses His essential being so "being made" (Heb 7:26) marks what He became in His assumed manhood (Php 2:6-9). Paul shows that His humbled form (at which the Jews might stumble) is no objection to His divine Messiahship. As the law was given by the ministration of angels and Moses, it was inferior to the Gospel given by the divine Son, who both is (Heb 1:4-14) as God, and has been made, as the exalted Son of man (Heb 2:5-18), much better than the angels. The manifestations of God by angels (and even by the angel of the covenant) at different times in the Old Testament, did not bring man and God into personal union, as the manifestation of God in human flesh does.<p>by inheritance obtained&#8212;He always had the thing itself, namely, Sonship; but He "obtained by inheritance," according to the promise of the Father, the name "Son," whereby He is made known to men and angels. He is "the Son of God" is a sense far exalted above that in which angels are called "sons of God" (Job 1:6; 38:7). "The fulness of the glory of the peculiar name "the Son of God," is unattainable by human speech or thought.

Christ is so much better than the angels, as the Creator, than the creature; as an independent being, than a dependent one; as he that blesses, than he that is blessed; as he that is worshipped, than he that worships: as a king, than his subjects; as a master, than his servants; and as he that sends, than he that is sent: and Christ may be said to be "made so", when he was manifested and declared to be so; and he was actually preferred to them, and exalted above them in human nature, after he had expiated the sins of his people, and when he was set down at the right hand of God, as in the latter part of the preceding verse, with which these words stand connected; for in his state of humiliation, and through his sufferings and death, he was made lower than they; but when he was risen from the dead, and ascended to heaven, he was placed at the right hand of God, where none of them ever was, or ever will be: besides, the phrase, "being made", signifies no more than that "he was"; and so the Syriac version renders it, "and he was so much better than the angels"; and so the Ethiopic version, "he is so much better": and this is observed, to prove him to be more excellent than any creature, since he is preferred to the most excellent of creatures; and to show, that the Gospel dispensation is superior to the legal dispensation, which was introduced by the ministration of angels; and to take off the Jews from the worship of angels, to which they were prone: and this doctrine of his could not be well denied by them, since it was the faith of the Jewish church, that the Messiah should be preferred to the angels: for in their ancient writings they say of him, he shall be exalted above Abraham, he shall be lifted up above Moses, and be higher than the ministering angels (s); and that he is above them, appears from what follows, <p>as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they; which is that of the Son of God, a name peculiar to him; and which belongs to him in such a sense as it does not to angels, as is evident from the following verse: and though this name is not founded on his office, as Mediator, but arises from his nature and relation to God; yet he was declared to be the Son of God, and it was made manifest, that this name of right belonged to him, upon the discharge of his office, at his resurrection and ascension to heaven; and therefore he is said to obtain it by inheritance; or he appeared to inherit it of right, and that it was his possession for evermore. <p>(s) Tanchuma spud Huls. p. 321. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> name than they.</span><p>(4) Before he comes to declare the office of Christ, he sets forth the excellency of his person.

The author has first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,...">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>, instituted a parallel between the mediators of the Old Testament revelations in general or <span class="ital">in pleno</span>, and the Mediator of the Christian revelation. But among the revelations of God under the Old Covenant, none attained in point of glory to the Mosaic; inasmuch as this was given not only through the medium of a man enlightened by the Spirit of God,—<span class="ital">i.e.</span> by one of the <span class="greekheb">προφῆται</span>, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>,—but, according to the universal Jewish belief (<span class="ital">vid. ad</span> ii. 2), was given by the instrumentality not only of Moses, but also of angels.

Contrary to the context, Delitzsch says: the name <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΥἹΌς</span></span></span> suffices not to express the thought in connection with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὌΝΟΜΑ</span></span></span>. The supra-angelic name, to which the author refers, lies beyond the notionally separating and sundering language of men. It is the heavenly total-name of the Exalted One, His <span class="greekheb">שֵׁם הַמְּפֹרָשׁ</span>, <span class="ital">nomen explicitum</span>, which in this world has entered into no human heart, and can be uttered by no human tongue, the <span class="greekheb">ὄνομα ὃ οὐδεὶς οἶδεν εἰ μὴ αὐτός</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>. The following words of Scripture are, he supposes, only upward pointing signs, which call forth in us some foreboding as to how glorious He is. But this is opposed to the connection. For even though it be true, as advanced by Delitzsch in support of his view, that in the following O. T. passages there occur also, in addition to <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span>, the wider appellations <span class="greekheb">θεός</span> and <span class="greekheb">κύριος</span>; yet, on the other hand, not merely <span class="greekheb">ἐν υἱῷ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>, as likewise <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you?

We have not, in connection with <span class="greekheb">κεκληρονόμηκεν</span>, to think “quite in general of the O. T. time, in which the future Messiah received in the Word of God the name of Son,” as is asserted by Riehm (Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr. p. 274), whose statement is endorsed by E.

The exaltation of the Mediator to the right hand of Sovereignty is in keeping with His designation as Son, a designation which marked Him out as superior to the angels. Proof is adduced from the O.T. To this proof, in accordance with the writer’s manner, a resulting admonition is attached, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-1.htm" title="Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip....">Hebrews 2:1-4</a>. And the remainder of chap. 2 is occupied with an explanation of the reasonableness of the incarnation and the suffering it involved; or, in other words, it is explained why if Christ is really greater than the angels, He had to be made a little lower than they.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοσούτῳ κρείττων γενόμενος</span> … “having become as much superior to the angels as He has obtained a more excellent name than they”. The form of comparison here used, <span class="greekheb">τοσ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ὅσῳ</span> is found also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-20.htm" title="And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:...">Hebrews 7:20-22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm" title="Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.">Hebrews 10:25</a>; also in Philo. <span class="greekheb">κρείττων</span> is one of the words most necessary in an Epistle in which comparison is never out of sight. The Son <span class="ital">became</span> (<span class="greekheb">γενόμενος</span>) greater than the angels in virtue of taking His seat at God’s right hand. This exaltation was the result of His earthly work. It is as Mediator of the new revelation, who has cleansed the sinful by His death, that He assumes supremacy. And this is in keeping with and in fulfilment of His obtaining the name of Son. This name <span class="greekheb">κεκληρονόμηκεν</span>, He has obtained, not “von Anfang an” as Bleek and others say, but as Riehm points out, in the O.T. The Messiah, then future, was spoken of as Son; and therefore to the O.T. reference is at once made in proof. The Messianic Sonship no doubt rests upon the Eternal Sonship, but it is not the latter but the former that is here in view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In support of this statement the writer adduces an abundance of evidence, no fewer than seven passages being cited from the O.T. Before considering these, two preliminary objections may first be removed. (1) To us nothing may seem less in need of proof than that Christ who has indelibly impressed Himself on mankind is superior to the angels who are little more than a picturesque adornment of earthly life. But when this writer lived the angels may be said to have been in possession, whereas Christ had yet to win His inheritance. Moreover, as Schoettgen shows (p. 905) it was usual and needful to make good the proposition, “Messias major est Patriarchis, Mose, et Angelis ministerialibus”. Prof. Odgers, too, has shown (<span class="ital">Proceedings of Soc. of Hist. Theol.</span>, 1895–6) that quite possibly the writer had in view some Jewish Gnostics who believed that Christ Himself belonged to the angelic creation and had, with the angels, a fluid personality and no proper human nature. In any case it was worth the writer’s while to carry home to the conviction of his contemporaries that a mediation accomplished by one who was tempted and suffered and wrought righteousness, a mediation of an ethical and spiritual kind, must supersede a mediation accomplished by physical marvels and angelic ministries. (2) The passages cited from the Old Testament in proof of Christ’s superiority although their immediate historical application is disregarded, are confidently adduced in accordance with the universal use of Scripture in the writer’s time. But it must not be supposed that these passages are culled at random. With all his contemporaries this writer believed that where statements were made of an Israelitish king or other official in an ideal form not presently realised in those directly addressed or spoken of, these were considered to be Messianic, that is to say, destined to find their fulfilment and realisation in the Messiah. These interpretations of Scripture were the inevitable result of faith in God. The people were sure that God would somehow and at some time fulfil the utmost of His promise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first two quotations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>) illustrate the giving of the more excellent name; the remaining quotations exhibit the superiority of the Son to angels, or more definitely the supreme rule and imperishable nature of the Son, in contrast to the perishable nature and servile function of the angels.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">being made</span>] Rather, “becoming,” or “<span class="ital">proving himself to be</span>.” The allusion is to the Redemptive Kingdom of Christ, and the word merely qualifies the “better name.” Christ, regarded as the Agent or Minister of the scheme of Redemption, <span class="ital">became</span> mediatorially superior to the Angel-ministrants of the Old Dispensation, as He always <span class="ital">was</span> superior to them in dignity and essence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so much</span>] The familiar classical <span class="greekheb">ὄσῳ</span> … <span class="greekheb">τοσούτῳ</span> (involving the comparison and contrast which runs throughout this Epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-20.htm" title="And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:">Hebrews 7:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm" title="Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.">Hebrews 10:25</a>) is not found once in St Paul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">better</span>] This word, common as it is, is only thrice used by St Paul (and then somewhat differently), but occurs 13 times in this Epistle alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-9.htm" title="But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.">Hebrews 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-7.htm" title="And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.">Hebrews 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-34.htm" title="For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.">Hebrews 10:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-16.htm" title="But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.">Hebrews 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-35.htm" title="Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:">Hebrews 11:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so much better than the angels</span>] The writer’s object in entering upon the proof of this fact is not to check the tendency of incipient Gnostics to <span class="ital">worship</span> Angels. Of this there is no trace here, though St Paul in his letter to the Colossians, raised a warning voice against it. Here the object is to shew that the common Jewish boast that “they had received the law by the disposition of Angels” involved no disparagement to the Gospel which had been ministered by One who was “far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>). Many Jews held, with Philo, that the Decalogue alone had been uttered by God, and that all the rest of the Law had been spoken by Angels. The extreme development of Jewish Angelology at this period may be seen in the Book of Enoch. They are there called “the stars,” “the white ones,” “the sleepless ones.” St Clement of Rome found it necessary to reproduce this argument in writing to the Corinthians, and the 4th Book of Esdras illustrates the tendency of mind which it was desirable to counteract.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath by inheritance obtained</span>] Rather, “hath inherited.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm" title="And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.">Luke 1:35</a>. “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him and given Him a name which is above every name” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Php 2:9</a>). He does not here seem to be speaking of the eternal generation. Christ inherits His more excellent name, not as the Eternal Son, but as the God-Man. Possibly too the writer uses the word “inherited” with tacit reference to the prophetic promises.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a more excellent name than they</span>] Not here the name of “the only-begotten Son of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-18.htm" title="He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.">John 3:18</a>), which is in its fulness “a name which no one knoweth save Himself” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>). The “name” in Scripture often indeed implies the inmost essence of a thing. If, then, with some commentators we suppose the allusion to be to this Eternal and Essential name of Christ we must understand the word “inheritance” as merely phenomenal, the manifestation to our race of a præexistent fact. In that view the glory indicated by the name belonged <span class="ital">essentially</span> to Christ, and His work on earth only <span class="ital">manifested</span> the name by which it was known. This is perhaps better than to follow St Chrysostom in explaining “inherited” to mean “always possessed as His own.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32</a>, “He shall be called the Son of the Highest.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">more excellent … than</span>] This construction (<span class="greekheb">παρὰ</span> after a comparative) is not found once in St Paul’s Epistles, but several times in this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.">Hebrews 1:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>).

(For the same Greek form of comparison, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3</a>.) "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> ingentem printer caeteros excellentiam denotat" (Bengel). This verse, though, in respect of grammatical construction, it is the conclusion of the exordium, serves as the thesis of the first section of the argument to follow, the drift of which is to show the SON'S superiority to the angels. The mention of the angels comes naturally after the allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, viewed and quoted as it is afterwards in connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>, in which "<span class="accented">a little lower than</span> the angels" is taken to denote the state <span class="accented">previous</span> to the exaltation; and it is preparatory also for the argument that follows. The more distinguished name, expressing the measure of superiority to the angels, is (as the sequel shows) the name of SON, assigned (as aforesaid) to the Messiah in prophecy, and so, with all that it implies, "inherited" by him in time according to the Divine purpose. Observe the perfect, "hath inherited," instead of the aorist as hitherto, denotes, with the usual force of the Greek tense, the continuance of the inheritance obtained. If we have entered into the view all along taken by the writer, we shall see no difficulty in the SON being said to have <span class="accented">become</span> better than the angels at the time of his exaltation, as though he had been below them before. So he had in respect of his assumed humanity, and it is to the SON denoted in prophecy to be humanly manifested in time that the whole sentence in its main purport refers. As such, having been, with us, lower than the angels, he <span class="accented">became</span> greater, the interposed references to his eternal personality retaining their full force notwithstanding. But why should the name of SON in itself imply superiority to the angels? Angels themselves are, in the Old Testament, called "sons of God." It has been suggested that the writer of the Epistle was not aware of the angels being so designated, since the LXX., from which he invariably quotes, renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. But this is not so invariably. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; and Psalms 89:7, we find <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. And, whatever be the application of the words in each of these passages, they at any rate occur in the LXX. as denoting others than the Messiah. Nor, in any case, would it be easily supposable that one so versed in biblical lore as the writer must have been had been thus misled in so important a point of his argument. The fact is that his argument, properly understood, is quite consistent with a full knowledge of the fact that others as well as the Messiah are so designated. For it is not merely the term "Son" as applied to the Messiah in prophecy, but the unique manner in which it is so applied, that is insisted on in what follows. The form of his commencement shows this. He does not say, "Whom, except the Messiah, did he ever call Son?" but, "To which of the angels did he ever speak as follows, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee?" In language generally the meaning of a word may depend very materially on the context in which it occurs and other determining circumstances. Indeed, the mere use of the title in the singular, "my Son," carries with it a different idea from its use in the plural of a class of beings. But this is not all. A series of passages from the Old Testament is adduced by way of expressly showing that the sonship assigned to the Messiah carries with it the idea of a relation to God altogether beyond any ever assigned to angels. Such is the position of the writer. We shall see in the sequel how He makes it good. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The detailed development of the argument is now introduced. The point is to show the superiority of the agent of the new dispensation to the agents of the old - the angels and Moses. Christ's superiority to the angels is first discussed.<p>Being made so much better than the angels (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>The informal and abrupt introduction of this topic goes to show that the writer was addressing Jewish Christians, who were familiar with the prominent part ascribed to angels in the O.T. economy, especially in the giving of the law. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-9.htm">Galatians 3:9</a>. For being made, rend. having become; which is to be taken in close connection with sat down, etc., and in contrast with &#x3c9;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd; being, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. It is not denied that the Son was essentially and eternally superior to the angels; but his glorification was conditioned upon his fulfillment of the requirements of his human state, and it is this that is emphasized. After having passed through the experience described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>, he sat down on the right hand of the divine majesty as messianic sovereign, and so became or proved to be what in reality he was from eternity, superior to the angels. &#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; - &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#837; so much - as.

It does not indicate here moral excellence, but dignity and power. He became superior to the angels, resuming his preincarnate dignity, as he had been, for a brief period, less or lower than the angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm">Hebrews 2:7</a>). The superiority of Messiah to the angels was affirmed in rabbinical writings.<p>He hath by inheritance obtained (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>More neatly, as Rev., hath inherited, as a son.
