The quotation involves some difficulty.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, however, we find words identical with those of the text in most copies of the LXX.; but there is nothing answering to them in the Hebrew, and there is no sufficient reason for supposing that the clause has dropped out of the Hebrew text. There are similarities (both of subject and of diction) between the Psalm and the last section of the Song of Moses, which make it easy to see how the words could find their way into the Song. The Psalm belongs to a cycle (Psalms 93, 95-99) whose theme is the triumphant announcement of the coming of God’s kingdom, by which was denoted (as the readers of the Epistle knew) the kingdom of Christ. In the divine plan the predicted Theophany was coincident with the fulfilment of the Messianic hope. In both Psalm and Song we read of the judgment exercised and the vengeance inflicted by the enthroned King. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a>.) This agreement in tone and subject renders less important the question whether the Hebrew original of the Song really contained the words. The thought was familiar from Scripture, and in this very connection. When the Messiah, reigning as the Firstborn of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>), shall appear for judgment—that is, when God leadeth a second time His Firstborn into “the world of men” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm" title="For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.">Hebrews 2:5</a>), that He may receive full possession of His inheritance—He saith, And let all angels of God worship Him. The word here rendered “leadeth in” is in frequent use for the introduction of Israel (typically God’s “firstborn,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a>) into the land of Canaan. It should, perhaps, be noted that, though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a> “angels” may not be perfectly exact as a rendering of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Elohim, the</span> verse so distinctly expresses the homage done to the King by superhuman powers, that its fitness for the argument here is obvious.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:4-14 Many Jews had a superstitious or idolatrous respect for angels, because they had received the law and other tidings of the Divine will by their ministry. They looked upon them as mediators between God and men, and some went so far as to pay them a kind of religious homage or worship. Thus it was necessary that the apostle should insist, not only on Christ's being the Creator of all things, and therefore of angels themselves, but as being the risen and exalted Messiah in human nature, to whom angels, authorities, and powers are made subject. To prove this, several passages are brought from the Old Testament. On comparing what God there says of the angels, with what he says to Christ, the inferiority of the angels to Christ plainly appears. Here is the office of the angels; they are God's ministers or servants, to do his pleasure. But, how much greater things are said of Christ by the Father! And let us own and honour him as God; for if he had not been God, he had never done the Mediator's work, and had never worn the Mediator's crown. It is declared how Christ was qualified for the office of Mediator, and how he was confirmed in it: he has the name Messiah from his being anointed. Only as Man he has his fellows, and as anointed with the Holy Spirit; but he is above all prophets, priests, and kings, that ever were employed in the service of God on earth. Another passage of Scripture, Ps 102:25-27, is recited, in which the Almighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared, both in creating the world and in changing it. Christ will fold up this world as a garment, not to be abused any longer, not to be used as it has been. As a sovereign, when his garments of state are folded and put away, is a sovereign still, so our Lord, when he has laid aside the earth and heavens like a vesture, shall be still the same. Let us not then set our hearts upon that which is not what we take it to be, and will not be what it now is. Sin has made a great change in the world for the worse, and Christ will make a great change in it for the better. Let the thoughts of this make us watchful, diligent, and desirous of that better world. The Saviour has done much to make all men his friends, yet he has enemies. But they shall be made his footstool, by humble submission, or by utter destruction. Christ shall go on conquering and to conquer. The most exalted angels are but ministering spirits, mere servants of Christ, to execute his commands. The saints, at present, are heirs, not yet come into possession. The angels minister to them in opposing the malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting and keeping their bodies, instructing and comforting their souls, under Christ and the Holy Ghost. Angels shall gather all the saints together at the last day, when all whose hearts and hopes are set upon perishing treasures and fading glories, will be driven from Christ's presence into everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And again - Margin, "When he bringeth in again." The proper construction of this sentence probably is, "But when, moreover, he brings in," etc. The word "again" refers not to the fact that the Son of God is brought "again" into the world, implying that he had been introduced before; but it refers to the course of the apostle's argument, or to the declaration which is made about the Messiah in another place. "The name Son is not only given to him as above, but also in another place, or on another occasion when he brings in the first-begotten into the world." "When he bringeth in." When he introduces. So far as the "language" here is concerned this might refer to the birth of the Messiah, but it is evident from the whole connection that the writer means to refer to something that is said in the Old Testament. This is plain because the passage occurs among quotations designed to prove a specific point - that the Son of God, the Author of the Christian system, was superior to the angels.<p>A declaration of the writer here, however true and solemn, would not have answered the purpose. A "proof-text" was missing; a text which would be admitted by those to whom he wrote to bear on the point under consideration. The meaning then is, "that on another occasion different from those to which he had referred, God, when speaking of the Messiah, or when introducing him to mankind, had used language showing that he was superior to the angels." The meaning of the phrase, "when he bringeth in," therefore, I take to be, when he introduces him to people; when he makes him known to the world - to wit, by the declaration which he proceeds immediately to quote. "The first-begotten." Christ is called the "first-begotten," with reference to his resurrection from the dead, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>. It is probable here, however, that the word is used, like the word "first-born," or "first-begotten" among the Hebrews, by way of eminence.<p>As the first-born was the principal heir, and had special privileges, so the Lord Jesus Christ sustains a similar rank in the universe of which God is the Head and Father; see notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the word "only-begotten" is used to denote the dignity and honor of the Lord Jesus. "Into the world." When he introduces him to mankind, or declares what he is to be. "He saith, And let all the angels of God worship him." Much difficulty has been experienced in regard to this quotation, for it cannot be denied that it is intended to be a quotation. In the Septuagint these very words occur in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, where they are inserted in the Song of Moses. But they are not in the Hebrew, nor are they in all the copies of the Septuagint. The Hebrew is, "Rejoice, O ye nations with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries." The Septuagint is, "Rejoice ye heavens with him; and let all the angels of God worship him. Let the nations rejoice with his people, and let all the sons of God be strong in him, for he has avenged the blood of his sons." But there are objections to our supposing that the apostle had this place in his view, which seem to me to settle the matter.<p>(1) one is, that the passage is not in the Hebrew; and it seems hardly credible that in writing to Hebrews, and to those residing in the very country where the Hebrew Scriptures were constantly used, he should adduce as a proof-text on an important doctrine what was not in their Scriptures.<p>(2) a second is, that it is omitted in all the ancient versions except the Septuagint.<p>(3) a third is, that it is impossible to believe that the passage in question in Deuteronomy had any reference to the Messiah. It does not relate to his "introduction" to the world. It would not occur to any reader that it had any such reference. The context celebrates the victory over the enemies of Israel which God will achieve. After saying that "his arrows would be drunk with blood, and that his sword would devour flesh with the blood of the slain and of captives, from the time when he began to take vengeance on an enemy," the Septuagint (not the Hebrew) immediately asserts, "let the heavens rejoice at the same time with him, and let all the angels of God worship him." That is, "Let the inhabitants of the heavenly world rejoice in the victory of God over the enemies of his people, and let them pay their adoration to him." But the Messiah does not appear to be alluded to anywhere in the context; much less described as "introduced into the world."<p>There is, moreover, not the slightest evidence that it was ever supposed by the Jews to have any such reference; and though it might be said that the apostle merely quoted "language" that expressed his meaning - as we often do when we are familiar with any well-known phrase that will exactly suit our purpose and convey an idea - yet it should be remarked that this is not the way in which this passage is quoted. It is a "proof-text," and Paul evidently meant to be understood as saying that that passage had a "fair" reference to the Messiah. It is evident, moreover, that it would be admitted to have such a reference by those to whom he wrote. It is morally certain, therefore, that this was not the passage which the writer intended to quote. The probability is, that the writer here referred to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a>, (in the Septuagint <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-7.htm">Psalm 96:7</a>). In that place, the Hebrew is, "worship him, all ye gods" &#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  kaal 'elohiym - "all ye 'elohiym."<p>In the Septuagint it is, "Let all his angels worship him;" where the translation is literal, except that the word "God" - "angels of God" - is used by the apostle instead of "his" - "all his angels" - as it is in the Septuagint. The word "gods" - &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'elohiym - is rendered by the word "angels" - but the word may have that sense. Thus, it is rendered by the Septuagint; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-15.htm">Job 20:15</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>. It is well known that the word &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'elohiym may denote "kings" and "magistrates," because of their rank and dignity; and is there anything improbable in the supposition that, for a similar reason, the word may be given also to "angels"? The fair interpretation of the passage then would be, to refer it to "angelic beings" - and the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/97-1.htm">Psalm 97:1-12</a> is for them to do homage to the Being there referred to. The only question then is, whether the Psalm can be regarded properly as having any reference to the Messiah? Did the apostle fairly and properly use this language as referring to him? On this we may remark:<p>(1) That the fact that he uses it thus may be regarded as proof that it would be admitted to be proper by the Jews in his time, and renders it probable that it was in fact so used.<p>(2) two Jewish Rabbis of distinction - Rashi and Kimchi - affirm that all the Psalms P<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/93.htm">1 Samuel 93-101</a> are to be regarded as referring to the Messiah. Such was, and is, the opinion of the Jews.<p>(3) there is nothing in the Psalm which forbids such a reference, or which can be shown to be inconsistent with it. Indeed the whole Psalm might be taken as beautifully descriptive of the "introduction" of the Son of God into the world, or as a sublime and glorious description of his advent. Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>, the earth is called on to rejoice that the Lord reigns. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2-5</a>, he is introduced or described as coming in the most magnificent manner - clouds and darkness attend him; a fire goes before him; the lightnings play; and the hills melt like wax - a sublime description of his coming, with appropriate symbols, to reign, or to judge the world. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>, it is said that all people shall see his glory; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>, that all who worship graven images shall be confounded, and "all the angels are required to do him homage;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8-12</a>, the effect of his advent is described as filling Zion with rejoicing, and the hearts of the people of God with gladness. It cannot be proveD, therefore, that this Psalm had no reference to the Messiah; but the presumption is that it had, and that the apostle has quoted it not only as it was usually regarded in his time, but as it was designed by the Holy Ghost. If so, then it proves, what the writer intended, that the Son of God should be adored by the angels; and of course that he was superior to them. It proves also more. Whom would God require the angels to adore? A creature? A man? A fellow-angel? To ask these questions is to answer them. He could require them to worship none but God, and the passage proves that the Son of God is divine. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. And&#8212;Greek, "But." Not only this proves His superiority, BUT a more decisive proof is Ps 97:7, which shows that not only at His resurrection, but also in prospect of His being brought into the world (compare Heb 9:11; 10:5) as man, in His incarnation, nativity (Lu 2:9-14), temptation (Mt 4:10, 11), resurrection (Mt 28:2), and future second advent in glory, angels were designed by God to be subject to Him. Compare 1Ti 3:16, "seen of angels"; God manifesting Messiah as one to be gazed at with adoring love by heavenly intelligences (Eph 3:10; 2Th 1:9, 10; 1Pe 3:22). The fullest realization of His Lordship shall be at His second coming (Ps 97:7; 1Co 15:24, 25; Php 2:9). "Worship Him all ye gods" ("gods," that is, exalted beings, as angels), refers to God; but it was universally admitted among the Hebrews that God would dwell, in a peculiar sense, in Messiah (so as to be in the Talmud phrase, "capable of being pointed to with the finger"); and so what was said of God was true of, and to be fulfilled in, Messiah. Kimchi says that the ninety-third through the hundred first Psalms contain in them the mystery of Messiah. God ruled the theocracy in and through Him.<p>the world&#8212;subject to Christ (Heb 2:5). As "the first-begotten" He has the rights of primogeniture (Ro 8:29); Col 1:15, 16, 18). In De 32:43, the Septuagint has, "Let all the angels of God worship Him," words not now found in the Hebrew. This passage of the Septuagint may have been in Paul's mind as to the form, but the substance is taken from Ps 97:7. The type David, in the Ps 89:27 (quoted in Heb 1:5), is called "God's first-born, higher than the kings of the earth"; so the antitypical first-begotten, the son of David, is to be worshipped by all inferior lords, such as angels ("gods," Ps 97:7); for He is "King of kings and Lord of lords" (Re 19:16). In the Greek, "again" is transposed; but this does not oblige us, as Alford thinks, to translate, "when He again shall have introduced," &c., namely, at Christ's second coming; for there is no previous mention of a first bringing in; and "again" is often used in quotations, not to be joined with the verb, but parenthetically ("that I may again quote Scripture"). English Version is correct (compare Mt 5:33; Greek, Joh 12:39).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is a further proof of the great gospel Minister being more excellent than angels, by God’s command to them to worship him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the world:</span> palin some refer to God the Father’s speech, as: <span class="ital">Again he saith:</span> others think it too gross a transposition, and unusual in the Scripture, and so read it as it stands in the Greek text: He again, or a second time, bringeth, &c.

By "the first begotten" is meant Christ. This is a name given him in the Old Testament, and is what the Hebrews were acquainted with, and therefore the apostle uses it; it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a> from whence it seems to be taken here, and which the ancient Jews (u) acknowledge is to be understood of the Messiah; who, as the Son of God, is the only begotten of the Father, and was begotten from eternity, as before declared, and before any creature had a being, and therefore called the firstborn of every creature, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a> and is sometimes styled the first begotten from the dead; he rose the first in time, and is the first in causality and dignity: and he may be called the firstborn, with respect to the saints, who are of the same nature with him, and are partakers of the divine nature, and are adopted into the family of God, though they are not in the same class of sonship with him; and the bringing of him into the world may refer to his second coming, for this seems agreeable from the natural order of the words, which may be rendered, "when he shall bring again", &amp;c. that is, a second time, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-1.htm">Psalm 97:1</a> from whence the following words are cited; and from the glory he shall then have from the angels, who will come with him, and minister to him; and not to his resurrection from the dead, when he was exalted above angels, principalities, and powers; though, as we read the words, they seem to regard his first coming in to this habitable world, at his incarnation and birth, when he was attended with angels, and worshipped by them, according to the order of God the Father, as follows: <p>he saith, and let all the angels of God worship him; these words are cited from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a> where the angels are called Elohim, gods. So Aben Ezra on the place observes, that there are some (meaning their doctors) who say, that "all the gods are the angels"; and Kimchi says, that the words are not imperative, but are in the past tense, instead of the future, <p>all the angels have worshipped him; that is, they shall worship him; as they have done, so they will do. According to our version, they are called upon to worship God's firstborn, his only begotten Son, with a religious worship and adoration, even all of them, not one excepted; which shows, that Christ, as the first begotten, is the Lord God, for he only is to be served and worshipped; and that if angels are to worship him, men ought; and that angels are not to be worshipped, and that Christ is preferable to them; and the whole sets forth the excellency and dignity of his person.

It must then have been written: <span class="greekheb">πάλιν δέ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅταν εἰσαγάγῃ</span> … <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>. The possibility of an inversion of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ</span></span></span> is defended, it is true, by Bleek, after the precedent of Carpzov, on the authority of two passages in Philo (<span class="ital">Legg. Allegor</span>. iii. p. 66; ed. Mangey, p. 93). But neither of these presents a case analogous to the one before us, nor does an inversion of the <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> at all take place in them. For in both <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ</span></span></span> has the signification <span class="ital">in turn</span>, or <span class="ital">on the other hand</span>, inasmuch as in the former two classes of persons (<span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ νοῦν τὸν ἴδιον ἀπολείπων</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΔἙ ΠΆΛΙΝ ἈΠΟΔΙΔΡΆΣΚΩΝ ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span>), in the latter two classes of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑΙ</span></span></span> or opinions (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΜῈΝ ΤῸΝ ἘΠῚ ΜΈΡΟΥς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΤῸΝ ΓΕΝΝΗΤῸΝ ΚΑῚ ΘΝΗΤῸΝ ἈΠΟΛΙΠΟῦΣΑ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΔῈ ΠΆΛΙΝ ΘΕῸΝ ἈΠΟΔΟΚΙΜΆΖΟΥΣΑ</span></span></span>), are compared together by way of contrast, in such wise that in both <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ</span></span></span> only serves for bringing the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΈ</span></span></span> into stronger relief, and in both has occupied its legitimate place. By virtue of its position, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ</span></span></span>, in our passage, can be construed only with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸΣΑΓΆΓῌ</span></span></span>, in such wise that a bringing again of the First-born into the world, which is an event still belonging to the future, is spoken of. In the former member of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a> the reference can accordingly be neither to the time of the Incarnation of the Son (Chrysostom, Primasius, Calvin, Owen, Calov, Bengel, Storr, Kuinoel [Stuart: or beginning of His ministry], Bleek II. <span class="ital">alii</span>); nor to the time of the Resurrection and Exaltation to heaven (Schlichting, Grotius, Hammond, Wittich, Braun, Wetstein, Rambach, Peirce, Whitby, and others); nor, as Bleek I. supposed, to a moment yet preceding the Incarnation of Christ, in which the Father had, by a solemn act as it were, conducted forth and presented the Son to the beings created by Him, as the First-born, as their Creator and Ruler, who was to uphold and guide all things,[36]—which in any case would be an entirely singular thought in the N. T.,—but simply and alone to the coming again of Christ to judgment, and the accomplishment of the Messianic kingdom. So, rightly, Gregory Nyssen, <span class="ital">contra Eunom. Orat</span>. iii. p. 541; Cornelius a Lapide, Cameron [Mede: for the inauguration of His millennial kingdom], Gerhard, Calmet, Camerarius, Estius, Gomar, Böhme, de Wette, Tholuck, Bisping, Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>.

The objection brought by Bleek and Ebrard against this interpretation of the former member, required as it is by the exigencies of the grammar, viz. that the discourse could not turn on the bringing again of the First-born into the world, unless an earlier bringing in of the same into the world, or at least a former being of the Son <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ οἰκουμένῃ</span> had been explicitly spoken of, is invalidated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>, where certainly the discourse was already of the historic appearing of the Son on earth, and thus of a first bringing in of the same into the world. The additional objection of Bleek, however, that the author would hardly have limited the scope of a divine summons to the angels to do homage to the First-born to a time even in his day future, is set aside by the consideration that, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, Christ was during His earthly life humbled to a condition beneath the angels, and only the Parousia itself is the epoch at which His majesty will be unfolded in full glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΠΡΩΤΌΤΟΚΟΝ</span></span></span>] in the N.

Literaturbl. to the Darmstadt <span class="ital">A. K.-Z.</span>, No. 29, p. 662; Riehm, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 292 f.; Kurtz, Ewald, and others). For this interpretation is excluded by the absoluteness of the expression in our passage. Rather is Christ called the First-born with respect to Christians, who are His brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a> f.), and therefore likewise <span class="greekheb">υἱοί</span> of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>).

For, in the former passage, the LXX. have a reading divergent from that of our text, in the words: <span class="greekheb">καὶ προσκυνήσατε αὐτῷ πάντες</span> [<span class="greekheb">οἱ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι αὐτοῦ</span>, whereas in the Codex Vaticanus of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, the words occur as in our text; while the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span>, taken up by the author into his citation, manifestly points—seeing that it is without any importance for his reasoning—to the verbatim reproduction of an O. T. utterance. Now, it is true our author follows in other cases a form of the Sept. text which bears affinity less to that contained in the Codex Vaticanus than to that in the Codex Alexandrinus, and the latter displays the variation from the Cod. Vat. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, in so far as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΥἹΟῚ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> is found therein in place of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΓΕΛΟΙ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>. But the Song of Moses, of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a> forms the conclusion, is communicated anew, in many MSS. of the LXX., and so also in the Codex Alexandrinus, in a second recension, having its place after the Psalms; and in this second recension the Codex Alexandrinus, too, reads <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΓΕΛΟΙ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, only the article <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ</span></span></span> has been interpolated between <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΝΤΕς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΓΕΛΟΙ</span></span></span>. It is probable, therefore, that the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews did not take the citation direct from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, but mediately, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> from that second recension of the hymn.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It remains to be said that the words of the citation are wanting in the Hebrew; they are found only in the LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προσκυνεῖν</span>] with the <span class="ital">dative</span> only in the case of later classic authors, whereas the earlier combine the <span class="ital">accusative</span> with this verb.

A ce moment, les anges seuls étaient les êtres formant pour ainsi dire l’Eglise du Verbe (comme <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>), et qui pouvaient recevoir l’ordre de Dieu d’adorer le Fils.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅταν δὲ πάλιν εἰσαγάγῃ</span> … “And when He shall again have brought the first-begotten into the world [of men], He says, “And let all God’s angels worship Him”. Having shown that “Son” is a designation reserved for the Messiah and not given to any of the angels, the writer now advances a step and adduces a Scripture which shows that the relation of angels to the Messiah is one of worship. It is not easy to determine whether <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> merely indicates a fresh quotation (so Bleek, Bruce, etc.) as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>; or should be construed with <span class="greekheb">εἰσαγάγῃ</span>. On the whole, the latter is preferable. Both the position of <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> and the tense of <span class="greekheb">εἰσαγ</span>. seem to make for this construction. The “bringing in” is still future. Apparently it is to the second Advent reference is made; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>. To refer <span class="greekheb">εἰσαγ</span>. to the incarnation, with Chrysostom, Calvin, Bengel, Bruce (see esp. Schoettgen); or to the resurrection with Grotius; or to an imagined introduction of the Son to created beings at some past period, with Bleek, is, as Weiss says, “sprachwidrig”. Rendall remarks: “The words <span class="ital">bring in</span> have here a legal significance; they denote the introduction of an heir into his inheritance, and are used by the LXX with reference to putting Israel in possession of his own land both in the time of Joshua and at the Restoration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm" title="And I will bring you in to the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-17.htm" title="You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.">Exodus 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-5.htm" title="And the LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers.">Deuteronomy 30:5</a>).” This throws light not only on <span class="greekheb">εἰσαγ</span>. but also on <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκον</span> and <span class="greekheb">οἰκουμένην</span>, and confirms the interpretation of the clause as referring to the induction of the first-born into His inheritance, the world of men. <span class="greekheb">πρωτότ</span>. is used of Christ (1) in relation to the other children of Mary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>); (2) in relation to other men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>); (3) in relation to creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>). Nowhere else in N.T. is it used absolutely; but <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a>. “I will make him first-born,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, superior in dignity and closer in intimacy. <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, the present is used because the words recorded in Scripture and still unfulfilled are meant. These words, <span class="greekheb">καὶ προσκυνησάτωσαν</span> … occur verbatim in Moses’ song (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>). In the Alexandrian text, from which this writer usually quotes, we find <span class="greekheb">υἱοὶ Θεοῦ</span> (<span class="ital">v</span>. Swete’s LXX), but in a copy of the song subjoined to the Psalter this MS. itself has <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>. The words are not represented in the Hebrew, and are supposed by Delitzsch to have been added in the liturgical use of Moses’ song. The part of the song to which they are attached represents the coming of God to judgment, a fact which further favours the view that it is the second Advent our author has in view.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world</span>] The older and literal rendering is as in the R. V., “<span class="ital">and when he, again, shall have brought in</span> …” The A. V. takes the word “again” (<span class="ital">palin</span>) as merely introducing a new quotation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-13.htm" title="And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.">Hebrews 2:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-5.htm" title="And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.">Hebrews 4:5</a>, &c. The word “again,” says Bp. Wordsworth, serves the purpose of inverted commas (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/15-10.htm" title="And again he said, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people....">Romans 15:10-12</a>). In that case it is displaced by an accidental <span class="ital">hyperbaton</span> or <span class="ital">trajection</span>, as this transmission of a word into another clause is called. If however the “again” belongs to the verb it can only be explained of Christ’s second coming to judge the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a>) unless the writer, assuming the point of view of the ancient prophet, alludes to the Resurrection. But since the mere displacement of the <span class="ital">palin</span> is certainly possible, it is better to accept this simple explanation than either to adopt these latter theories or to suppose that there had been some previous and premundane presentation of the Son to all created beings. <span class="ital">Hypotheses non fingo</span> is a rule even more necessary for the theologian than for the scientist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bringeth in</span>] The Greek verb is in the aorist subjunctive (<span class="greekheb">εἰσαγαγῇ</span>), and means “shall have brought in,” exactly as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm" title="And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.">Exodus 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-11.htm" title="And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,">Exodus 13:11</a> (where the same word occurs in the LXX.) and as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-10.htm" title="So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.">Luke 17:10</a>, “when ye <span class="ital">shall have done</span> all that is commanded you” (<span class="greekheb">ποιήσητε</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the firstbegotten</span>] Rather, “first-born.” This title (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a>) was always applied in a Messianic sense to Christ as “the first-born of all creation” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>; and the first-born of many brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings....">Hebrews 2:10-11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into the world</span>] The Greek word here used is not <span class="ital">kosmos</span> the material world, but <span class="ital">oikoumene</span> “the habitable world.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he saith</span>] The language of the Scriptures is regarded as a permanent, continuous, and living utterance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-7.htm" title="Why (as the Holy Ghost said, To day if you will hear his voice,">Hebrews 3:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-6.htm" title="As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:...">Hebrews 8:8-10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And let all the angels of God worship him</span>] It is doubtful whether the quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a> “worship Him all ye gods (<span class="ital">Elohim</span>)”—where the word <span class="ital">Elohim</span> is rendered “angels” in the LXX. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm" title="For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and honor.">Psalm 8:5</a>—or rather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, where there is an “and,” and where the LXX. either added these words or found them in the Hebrew text.

Mill is of opinion that the omission was occasioned long ago by the recurrence of the verb <span class="greekheb">הרנינו</span>. Then [after the words in the LXX. at the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm" title="So I spoke to you; and you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>] there follows in Moses, <span class="greekheb">εὐφράνθητε ἔθνη μετὰ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">הרנינו גוים עמו</span> (where <span class="greekheb">ב</span> after <span class="greekheb">מ</span> is wanting), which <span class="ital">Paul</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm" title="And again he said, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.">Romans 15:10</a>, also refers to the times of the Messiah. Moses, especially in the Song, wrote of Christ. Nevertheless, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a> has, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΚΥΝΉΣΑΤΕ ΑὐΤῷ ΠΆΝΤΕς ΟἹ ἌΓΓΕΛΟΙ ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span>; and Paul refers to this psalm, for <span class="ital">the bringing in of the First-begotten into the world</span>, in this passage, corresponds to the inscription of the psalm in the LXX, <span class="greekheb">τῷ Δαβὶδ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτε ἡ γῆ αὐτοῦ καθίσταται</span>, that is, <span class="ital">of David, when the land is brought under his authority</span>, as Oederus has observed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[7] Ætiologia.

The most obvious translation of the Greek here seems at first sight to be, "But whenever he [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God] shall again bring [or, 'bring back'] the Firstborn into the inhabited world, he saith;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x1fc3;</span> denoting the indefiniteness of future time, and the position of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> connecting it most naturally with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x1fc3;</span>. If such be the force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, the reference must be to the second advent; which, however, is not suggested by the context, in which there has been no mention of a first advent, but only of the assignation to the Messiah of the name of Son. This supposed reference to a second advent may be avoided by disconnecting <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in sense from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x1fc3;</span>, and taking it (as in the verse immediately preceding, and elsewhere in the Epistle) as only introducing a new quotation. And the Greek will bear this interpretation, though the order of the words, taken by themselves, is against it. The "Firstborn" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is evidently the Son previously spoken of; the word is so applied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>) in a passage undoubtedly founded on the text last quoted. The same word is applied in the New Testament to Christ, as "the Firstborn among many brethren," "the Firstborn of every creature," "the Firstborn from the dead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>). And the idea conveyed by these passages may have been in the writer's mind, and intended to be understood by his Christian readers. But for the immediate purpose of his argument he may be supposed to refer only to this designation as applied in the Old Testament to the SON already spoken cf. Thus the meaning may be, "But, again, with reference to the time when he shall introduce this SON, the Firstborn, into our inhabited world, he speaks thus of the angels." Or it may be, "But whenever he shall bring a second time into the world the Firstborn who has already once appeared, he speaks thus of the angels." But the first meaning seems more suitable to the general context. The force of the writer's argument is the same, whichever view we take; the point being that, at the time of the advent of the So, whatever advent may be meant, the angels appear only as attendant worshippers. As to the understood nominative to "saith," we may suppose it to be "God," as in ver. 5. But it is to be observed that <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, without an expressed nominative, is a usual formula for introducing a scriptural quotation. The question remains - What is the text quoted, and how can it be understood as bearing the meaning here assigned to it? In the Hebrew Bible we find nothing like it, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a>, "Worship him, all ye gods," A.V.; where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a> we find in the LXX., though not in the Masoretic text, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: the very words, including the introductory <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, which are quoted. Hence, the quotations in this Epistle being mainly from the LXX., we may conclude that this is the text referred to. It occurs towards the end of the Song of Moses, in connection with its concluding picture of the LORD'S final triumph, in which the nations are called upon to rejoice with his people, when he would avenge the blood of his servants, and render vengeance to his adversaries, and make atonement for (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) his land and for his people. Viewed in the light of later prophecy, this triumph is identified with that of the Messiah's kingdom, and is therefore that of the time of bringing "the Firstborn into the world." cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm">Romans 15:10</a>, where "Rejoice, ye Gentiles," etc., from the same passage, is applied to the time of Christ. It is no objection to the quotation that, as it stands in the Epistle, "the Firstborn," though not mentioned in the original, seems to be regarded as the <span class="accented">object</span> of the angels' worship. The passage is simply cited as it stands, the reader being left to draw his own inference; and the main point of it is that the angels in "that day" are not, like the Son, sharers of the throne, but only worshippers. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Third quotation, marking the relation of angels to the Son.<p>And again, when he bringeth in, etc. (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Const. again with bringeth in.

This mode of introducing citations differs from that of Paul. The author's conception of the inspiration of Scripture leads him to regard all utterances of Scripture, without regard to their connection, as distinct utterances of God, or the Holy Spirit, or the Son of God; whereas, by Paul, they are designated either as utterances of Scripture in general, or of individual writers. Very common in this Epistle are the expressions, "God saith, said, spake, testifieth," or the like.
