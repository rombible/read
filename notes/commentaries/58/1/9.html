(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9-10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Therefore God.</span>—It is possible, but not probable, that the words, both here and in the Psalm, should be rendered, <span class= "ital">Therefore, O God, Thy God hath anointed Thee.</span><p><span class= "bld">Thy fellows</span>.—In the first application, probably, these words point to other earthly kings.

They looked upon them as mediators between God and men, and some went so far as to pay them a kind of religious homage or worship. Thus it was necessary that the apostle should insist, not only on Christ's being the Creator of all things, and therefore of angels themselves, but as being the risen and exalted Messiah in human nature, to whom angels, authorities, and powers are made subject. To prove this, several passages are brought from the Old Testament. On comparing what God there says of the angels, with what he says to Christ, the inferiority of the angels to Christ plainly appears. Here is the office of the angels; they are God's ministers or servants, to do his pleasure. But, how much greater things are said of Christ by the Father! And let us own and honour him as God; for if he had not been God, he had never done the Mediator's work, and had never worn the Mediator's crown. It is declared how Christ was qualified for the office of Mediator, and how he was confirmed in it: he has the name Messiah from his being anointed. Only as Man he has his fellows, and as anointed with the Holy Spirit; but he is above all prophets, priests, and kings, that ever were employed in the service of God on earth. Another passage of Scripture, Ps 102:25-27, is recited, in which the Almighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared, both in creating the world and in changing it. Christ will fold up this world as a garment, not to be abused any longer, not to be used as it has been. As a sovereign, when his garments of state are folded and put away, is a sovereign still, so our Lord, when he has laid aside the earth and heavens like a vesture, shall be still the same. Let us not then set our hearts upon that which is not what we take it to be, and will not be what it now is. Sin has made a great change in the world for the worse, and Christ will make a great change in it for the better. Let the thoughts of this make us watchful, diligent, and desirous of that better world. The Saviour has done much to make all men his friends, yet he has enemies. But they shall be made his footstool, by humble submission, or by utter destruction. Christ shall go on conquering and to conquer. The most exalted angels are but ministering spirits, mere servants of Christ, to execute his commands. The saints, at present, are heirs, not yet come into possession. The angels minister to them in opposing the malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting and keeping their bodies, instructing and comforting their souls, under Christ and the Holy Ghost. Angels shall gather all the saints together at the last day, when all whose hearts and hopes are set upon perishing treasures and fading glories, will be driven from Christ's presence into everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast loved righteousness - Thou hast been obedient to the Law of God, or holy and upright. Nothing can be more truly adapted to express the character of anyone than this is to describe the Lord Jesus, who was "holy, harmless, undefiled," who "did no sin, and in whose mouth no guile was found;" but it is with difficulty that this can be applied to Solomon. Assuredly, for a considerable part of his life, this declaration could not well be appropriate to him; and it seems to me that it is not to be regarded as descriptive of him at all. It is language prompted by the warm and pious imagination of the Psalmist describing the future Messiah - and, as applied to him, is true to the letter. "Therefore God, even thy God." The word "even" inserted here by the translators, weakens the force of the expression. This might be translated, "O God, thy God hath anointed thee." So it is rendered by Doddridge, Clarke, Stuart, and others.<p>The Greek will bear this construction, as well the Hebrew in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>. In the margin in the Psalm it is rendered "O God." This is the most natural construction, as it accords with what is just said before. "Thy throne, O God, is forever. Thou art just and holy, therefore, O God, thy God hath anointed thee," etc. It is not material, however, which construction is adopted. "Hath anointed thee." Anciently kings and priests were consecrated to their office by pouring oil on their heads; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-3.htm">Numbers 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-7.htm">2 Samuel 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. The expression "to anoint," therefore, comes to mean to consecrate to office, or to set apart to some public work. This is evidently the meaning in the Psalm, where the whole language refers to the appointment of the personage there referred to to the kingly office. "The oil of gladness." This probably means the perfumed oil that was poured on the head, attended with many expressions of joy and rejoicing. The inauguration of the Messiah as king would be an occasion of rejoicing and triumph. Thousands would exult at it as in the coronation of a king; and thousands would be made glad by such a consecration to the office of Messiah. "Above thy fellows." Above thine associates; that is, above all who sustain the kingly office. He would be more exalted than all other kings. Doddridge supposes that it refers to angels, who might have been associated with the Messiah in the government of the world. But the more natural construction is to suppose that it refers to kings, and to mean that he was the most exalted of all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. iniquity&#8212;"unnrighteousness." Some oldest manuscripts read, "lawlessness."<p>therefore&#8212;because God loves righteousness and hates iniquity.<p>God &#8230; thy God&#8212;Jerome, Augustine, and others translate Ps 45:7, "O God, Thy God, hath anointed thee," whereby Christ is addressed as God. This is probably the true translation of the Hebrew there, and also of the Greek of Hebrews here; for it is likely the Son is addressed, "O God," as in Heb 1:8. The anointing here meant is not that at His baptism, when He solemnly entered on His ministry for us; but that with the "oil of gladness," or "exulting joy" (which denotes a triumph, and follows as the consequence of His manifested love of righteousness and hatred of iniquity), wherewith, after His triumphant completion of His work, He has been anointed by the Father above His fellows (not only above us, His fellow men, the adopted members of God's family, whom "He is not ashamed to call His brethren," but above the angels, fellow partakers in part with Him, though infinitely His inferiors, in the glories, holiness, and joys of heaven; "sons of God," and angel "messengers," though subordinate to the divine Angel&#8212;"Messenger of the covenant"). Thus He is antitype to Solomon, "chosen of all David's many sons to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel," even as His father David was chosen before all the house of his father's sons. The image is drawn from the custom of anointing guests at feasts (Ps 23:5); or rather of anointing kings: not until His ascension did He assume the kingdom as Son of man. A fuller accomplishment is yet to be, when He shall be VISIBLY the anointed King over the whole earth (set by the Father) on His holy hill of Zion, Ps 2:6, 8. So David, His type, was first anointed at Bethlehem (1Sa 16:13; Ps 89:20); and yet again at Hebron, first over Judah (2Sa 2:4), then over all Israel (2Sa 5:3); not till the death of Saul did he enter on his actual kingdom; as it was not till after Christ's death that the Father set Him at His right hand far above all principalities (Eph 1:20, 21). The forty-fifth Psalm in its first meaning was addressed to Solomon; but the Holy Spirit inspired the writer to use language which in its fulness can only apply to the antitypical Solomon, the true Royal Head of the theocracy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity:</span> the administration of this King in his kingdom is suitable to his throne and sceptre, it is all goodness; for he so loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, being righteous and holy in himself, in life and death, expiating sin, and sanctifying believers.

Christ loves righteous persons and righteous works, faithfulness and integrity, and a just administration of government, everything that is holy, just, and good; which has appeared in the whole course of his life on earth, in working out a righteousness for his people, and in encouraging righteousness in them, which he leads them in the way of; and his love of justice will still more appear at the last day, when he will judge the world in righteousness, and give the crown of righteousness to proper persons: and he hates iniquity; or "unrighteousness", as the Alexandrian copy and another read; as being contrary to his nature, both as God and man, and to the righteous law of God; which has appeared by his inveighing against it, and dehorting from it; by his severity exercised towards delinquents; by his suffering for it, and abolishing of it; and by chastising his own people on account of it; and his abhorrence of it will still more appear at the day of judgment, when all workers of iniquity, professors and profane, will be bid to depart from him: <p>therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows: the anointer is the God of Christ; that is, God the Father, who is the God of Christ, as man; and is so called, because he prepared and formed the human nature of Christ, and supported it under all its sufferings, and has glorified it; and as such Christ prayed unto him, believed in him, loved him, and obeyed him: the anointed is the Son of God, the Son spoken to, and is called God in the preceding verse; though he is not anointed as God, but as Mediator, to be prophet, and priest, and King: what he is anointed with is not material oil, but spiritual, the Holy Ghost, as it is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a> called the oil of gladness, in allusion to the use of oil at feasts and weddings, for the delight and refreshment of the guests; and because of the spiritual effects of joy and gladness, both on Christ, as man, and on his people. Now Christ was anointed as Mediator from all eternity; that is, he was invested with his office as such; and at his conception and birth he was filled with the Holy Ghost; who also descended on him at his baptism, after which he went about doing good, and healing diseases; but here it seems to refer to the time of his ascension, when he was declared to be Lord and Christ, the anointed one; and received gifts for men, the fulness of the Spirit without measure, and with which he was anointed above his "fellows"; by whom are meant, not the angels, nor the kings and princes of the earth; but the saints, who are so called, because they are of the same nature, and are of the same family, and are partakers of the same spirit, and grace; and having received the unction from him, are also kings, priests, and prophets, and will be companions with him to all eternity. Now the reason of his being anointed, or exalted, and made Lord and Christ, is, because he loves righteousness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a> or rather, because he is anointed with the Holy Spirit without measure, therefore he loves righteousness; for the words may be rendered, "thou lovest righteousness--because God, thy God, hath anointed thee". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> iniquity; therefore God, <i>even</i> thy God, hath <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> fellows.</span><p>(r) This type of speech in which the Jews use contrasting phrases, has great force in it.<p>(s) In that, that the word became flesh, by sending the Holy Spirit on him without measure.<p>(t) For he is the head and we are his members.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm" title="You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Hebrews 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἠγάπησας δικαιοσύνην κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">Thou lovedst righteousness and hatedst wrong</span>.

Here, too, the author takes <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεός</span> as an apostrophe,[39] whereas in the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">אֱלֹהִים</span> is the subject to <span class="greekheb">משָׁחֲךָ</span>, and is taken up again into the discourse, and more nearly defined by <span class="greekheb">אֱלֹהֶיךָ</span>. The anointing with the oil of joy in the psalm is a figurative designation of the blessing and abundance given by God. Our author, however, understands it of the anointing to be king, as a figure of the divine glory with which the Son, after His life upon earth and His exaltation to heaven, has been crowned.

But what our author understood by it in the application is obscure. Kuinoel, Ebrard, Delitzsch, and Moll suppose the author, like the Psalmist, to intend the other kings; Riehm (Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr. p. 306), all earthly and heavenly princes; Wittich, Braun, Cramer, the kings, high priests, and prophets of the O. T., inasmuch as they were anointed as types of Christ; Klee, all the creatures; Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Bengel, and Bisping, men in general; Theodoret, Calvin, Beza, Cameron, Piscator, Schlichting, Maier, Kurtz, the Christians specially [Owen hesitates between <span class="ital">all believers</span> and <span class="ital">prophets and apostles</span>]; Bleek, Olshausen, Alford, and Ewald finally, after the precedent of Peirce and others, <span class="ital">the angels</span>, “as beings which do not indeed appear as sitting at the right hand of God, but yet as existing in immediate proximity to the divine throne.” The last supposition is the most probable. It is true de Wette regards it as the least conceivable, because the author has “placed the angels in no other position than deeply below Christ,” and Ebrard even thinks the author must have been “beside himself” if he had referred the words to the angels. But (1) it is a question throughout the whole section of a comparison of Christ with the angels; the renewed indication of this point of comparison also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm" title="You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Hebrews 1:9</a> cannot therefore in itself be found unsuitable. (2) If shortly before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>) the angels are placed deeply below Christ, so it will be admitted their inferiority is likewise expressly intimated by means of <span class="greekheb">παρά</span> in our passage. (3) The angels were, in the conception of the author, the next in rank after Christ; for they are exalted above men. To whom, therefore, could the author more fittingly apply the designation <span class="greekheb">μέτοχοι</span> than precisely to them? The objection of Delitzsch, finally, that after all angels are not anointed ones, would be of weight only if the author were obliged of necessity to think of the <span class="greekheb">μέτοχοι</span> too as anointed; he finds, on the contrary, in the anointing only of the Son, a fact expressed, from which the exaltedness of the same above His companions, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of those who of all others stand nearest to Him in dignity, is necessarily deduced. For <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆ</span></span></span> is used here not in the sense of the quantity arising from the notion of comparison, but denotes the part accruing to one to the exclusion of others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[39] On account of ver. 8 this construction is more natural than the supposition of Grimm, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 602; Alford, and Ewald (to which Delitzsch also leaves the choice open), that we have to explain in accordance with the Hebrew: “God, even Thy God.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm" title="You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Hebrews 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἠγάπησας δικαιοσύνην</span> … “Thou lovedst righteousness and didst hate lawlessness, therefore God, thy God, anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy fellows.” The quotation is verbatim from LXX of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm" title="All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you glad.">Psalm 45:8</a> [the Alexand. text reads <span class="greekheb">ἀδικίαν</span> in place of <span class="greekheb">ἀνομίαν</span>, so that the author used a text not precisely in agreement with that of Cod: Alex. <span class="ital">v</span>. Weiss]. The anointing as King is here said to have been the result [<span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>] of his manifestation of qualities fitting him to rule as God’s representative, namely, love of right and hatred of iniquity. [<span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm" title="Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.">1 John 3:4</a>, as the synonym and definition of <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἁμαρτία ἐστὶν ἡ ἀνομία</span>. It is contrasted with <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνῃ</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, <span class="greekheb">τίς γὰρ μετοχὴ δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἀνομίᾳ</span>;] It is the Messiah’s love of righteousness as manifested in His earthly life which entitles Him to sovereignty. <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span> is taken as a vocative here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm" title="But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.">Hebrews 1:8</a>, by Lünemann, Weiss and others; and <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός σου</span> as the direct nom. to <span class="greekheb">ἔχρισε</span>. Westcott thinks that the <span class="greekheb">ἔλαιον ἀγαλλ</span>. refers “not to the solemn anointing to royal dignity but to the festive anointing on occasions of rejoicing”. So Alford. Davidson, on the other hand, says: “As Kings were anointed when called to the throne, the phrase means made King”. So, too, Weiss and von Soden. But the psalm is not a coronation ode, but an epithalamium; the epithalamium, indeed, of the ideal King, but still a festive marriage song (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-10.htm" title="And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:...">Hebrews 1:10-14</a>), to which the festal <span class="greekheb">ἔλαιον ἀγαλ</span>. is appropriate. The oil of exultation is the oil expressive of intense joy (<span class="ital">cf.</span> psa 23:15 of the psalm). The only objection to this view is that God is said to be the anointer, but this has its parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>; and throughout Psalms 45. God is considered the originator of the happiness depicted (<span class="ital">cf. </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-2.htm" title="He makes me to lie down in green pastures: he leads me beside the still waters.">Psalm 23:2</a>). Whether the marriage rejoicings are here to be applied to the Messiah in terms of Psa 23:16 and 17 of the psalm is doubtful. The verse is cited probably for the sake of the note of superiority contained in <span class="greekheb">παρὰ τοὺς μετόχους σου</span>. In the psalm the <span class="greekheb">μέτοχοι</span> are hardly other Kings; rather the companions and counsellors of the young King. In the Messianic application they are supposed by Bleek, Pierce, Alford, Davidson, Peake, etc., to be the angels. It seems preferable to keep the term indefinite as indicating generally the supremacy of Christ (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-2.htm" title="You are fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into your lips: therefore God has blessed you for ever.">Psalm 45:2</a>).—[<span class="greekheb">παρά</span> “From the sense of (1) <span class="ital">beside, parallel to</span>, comes that of (2) <span class="ital">in comparison with</span>; and so (3) in <span class="ital">advantageous</span> comparison with, <span class="ital">more than, beyond</span>”.

And indeed the Son of God has the angels as His companions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-2.htm" title="And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, see, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,">Genesis 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm" title="If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:">Job 33:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm" title="You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.">Psalm 68:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a> : and it might have seemed proper that He should rather assume [take to Himself as associates] angels than the seed of Abraham, if a different economy [dispensation] had not demanded something different, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm" title="For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.">Hebrews 2:16</a>; and that very humiliation, of which Ibid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>, takes for granted intercourse with them. In short, the 45th Psalm itself addresses Christ as <span class="ital">God</span> in this very verse, and a little before as <span class="greekheb">גבור</span>, brave, strong, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.">Hebrews 1:4</a>; a term applied to the angels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm" title="Bless the LORD, you his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word.">Psalm 103:20</a>. Therefore the angels may appear to be called the fellows of Christ, especially since Paul refers all the sayings here quoted to the superiority of Christ above the angels. Nevertheless the peculiar relationship of Christ to men leads us to conclude, that men are here meant by “His fellows,” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a>, etc. For the Bridegroom has His companions, as the Bride has hers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-14.htm" title="She shall be brought to the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought to you.">Psalm 45:14</a> : and there is the same comparison, ibid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>, Thou art fairer than the sons of MEN.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Iniquity (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit. lawlessness.<p>Hath anointed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>.
