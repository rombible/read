(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>, where the same word is used.) “Shadow,” as the shadow has no substance or independent existence, but represents only the outline of an object. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>, where “shadow” is contrasted with “the very image”; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm" title=" Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.">Colossians 2:17</a>, where it is opposed to “the body.”) We must not confound these words, “token” and “shadow,” with “the pattern” mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>, quoted later in this verse. The “heavenly things” are “the sanctuary” and “the tabernacle “of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>, the realities to which the true earthly tabernacle corresponded; their nature can be understood only when Christ has come as High Priest of the good things to come. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>.) That every part of God’s earthly house might be a fitting emblem of spiritual truth to be afterwards revealed. Moses was charged in all respects to follow the pattern which had been shown him in the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>). Jewish tradition understood these words to imply the presentation of a heavenly tabernacle to the sight of Moses, as a model to be imitated with exactness; and Stephen’s words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm" title="Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.">Acts 7:44</a>, “according to the pattern” (the same word is here used) “which he had seen,” convey the same meaning. In itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>, when compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-9.htm" title="Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, said the Lord.">Hebrews 8:9</a> in the same chapter, does not necessarily involve a visible representation. But whether we think of a pattern shown in vision, or merely of explicit direction received by Moses, the meaning of “the heavenly things” remains the same. The view here presented of the Jewish tabernacle involves no depreciation, except in comparison with “the good things to come.” It was only <span class= "ital">a shadow;</span> but it rises above all temples and symbols of man’s art and device as being a shadow <span class= "ital">of the heavenly things.</span><p><span class= "bld">Was admonished of God.</span>—The words “of God” are not in the text, but are implied in “admonished.” (See the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-26.htm" title="And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.">Luke 2:26</a>.) “Hath been admonished:” another example of the writer’s characteristic mode of regarding Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/hebrews/8.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Hebrews<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE TRUE IDEAL</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>I DO not intend to deal with the original bearing of these words, nor with the use made of them by the writer of Hebrews. Primarily they refer to the directions as to the Tabernacle and its furniture, which are given at such length, and with such minuteness, in Leviticus, and are there said to have been received by Moses on Sinai. The author of this Epistle attaches an even loftier significance to them, as supporting his contention that the whole ceremonial worship, as well as the Temple and its equipment, was a copy of heavenly realities, the heavenly sanctuary and its altar and priest. I wish to take a much humbler view of the injunction, and to apply it, with permissible violence, as a maxim for conduct and the great rule for the ordering of our lives. ‘See that thou,’ in thy shop and office, and wherever thou mayst be, ‘make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.’ A far-reaching, high-soaring commandment, not to be obeyed without much effort, and able to revolutionise the lives of most of us. There are three points in it: the pattern, its universal applicability, and the place where we get to see it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The pattern.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The difference between noble and ignoble lives is very largely that the one has - and seeks, however partially and interruptedly, to follow - an ideal and the other has not. Or, to put it into plainer words, the one man regulates his life according to momentary inclinations and the obvious calls of sense, business and the like, and the other man has, far ahead and high up, a great light burning, to which he is ever striving to attain. The one has an aim to which he can only approximate, and the other largely lives from hand to mouth, as circumstances and sense, and the recurring calls of material necessities, or temptations that are put in his way every day, may dictate. And so, the one turns out a poor creature, and the other - God helping him - may turn out a saint. Which are you? Which we are depends very largely on the clearness with which we keep before us - like some great mountain summit rising above the mists, and stirring the ambition of every climber to reach the peak, where foot has never trod - the ideal, to use modern language, or to fall back upon the good old- fashioned Bible words, ‘the pattern shewed to us.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>You know that in mountain districts the mists are apt to gather their white folds round the summits, and that often for many days the dwellers in the plains have to plod along on their low levels, without a glimpse of the calm peak. And so it is with our highest ideal. Earth-born mists from the undrained swamps in our own hearts hide it too often from our eyes, and even when that is not the case, we are like many a mountaineer, who never lifts an eye to the sacred summit overhead, nor looks higher than his own fields and cattle-sheds. So it needs an effort to keep clear before us the pattern that is high above us, and to make very plain to ourselves, and very substantial in our thoughts, the unattained and untrodden heights. ‘Not in vain the distance’ should ‘beckon.’ ‘Forward, forward, let us range,’ should always be our word. ‘See that thou make all things after the pattern,’ and do not rule your lives according to whim, or fancy, or inclination, or the temptations of sense and circumstances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To aim at the unreached is the secret of perpetual youth. No man is old as long as he aspires. It is the secret of perpetual growth. No man stagnates till he has ceased to see, or to believe in great dim possibilities for character, as yet unrealised. It is the secret of perpetual blessedness. No man can be desolate who has for his companion the unreached self that he may become. And so artist, poet, painter, all live nobler lives than they otherwise would, because they live, not so much with the commonplace realities round them, as with noble ideals, be they of melody or of beauty, or of musical words and great thoughts. There should be the same life with, and directed towards, attaining the unstrained in the moralist, and above all in the Christian.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But then, do not let us forget that we are not here in our text, as I am using it in this sermon, relegated to a pattern which takes its origin, after all, in our own thoughts and imaginations The poet’s ideal, the painter’s ideal, varies according to his genius. Ours has taken solidity and substance and a human form, and stands before us, and says: ‘If any man serve Me, let him follow Me.’ ‘See that thou make all things according to the pattern,’ and be thankful that we are not left to our own thoughts, or to our brethren’s teachings, or to abstract ideas of the true and the beautiful and the good for our pattern and mould of life, but that we have the law embodied in a Person, and the ideal made actual, in our Brother and our Saviour. There is the joy and the blessedness of the Christian aim after Christian perfection. There is something unsubstantial, misty, shadowy, in an ideal which is embodied nowhere. It is ghost-like, and has little power to move or to attract. But for Christians the pattern is all gathered into the one sweet, heart. compelling form of Jesus, and whatever is remote and sometimes cold in the thought of an unattained aim, changes when we make it our supreme purpose to be like Jesus Christ. Our goal is no cold, solitary mountain top. It is the warm, loving heart, and companionable purity and perfectness of our Brother, and when we can, even in a measure, reach that sweet resting-place, we are wrapped in the soft atmosphere of His love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We shall be like Him when we see Him as He is; we grow like Him here, in the measure in which we do see Him, even darkly. We reach Him most surely by loving Him, and we become like Him most surely by loving Him, for love breeds likeness, and they who live near the light are drenched with the light, and become lights in their turn.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is another point here that I would suggest, and that is<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The universal applicability of the pattern - ‘See that thou make all things.’</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let us go back to Leviticus There you will find page after page that reads like an architect’s specification. The words that I have taken as my text are given in immediate connection with the directions for making the seven-branched candlestick, which are so minute and specific and detailed, that any brass-founder in Europe could make one to-day ‘after the pattern.’ So many bowls, so many knops, so many branches; such and such a distance between each of them; and all the rest of it - there it is, in most prosaic minuteness. Similarly, we read how many threads and fringes, and how many bells on the high priest’s robe. Verse after verse is full of these details; and then, on the back of them all, comes, ‘See that thou make all things according to the pattern.’ Which things are a parable - and just come to this, that the minutest pieces of daily life, the most commonplace and trivial incidents, may all be moulded after that great example, the life of Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is one of the miracles of revelation that it should be so. The life of Jesus Christ, in the fragmentary records of it in these four Gospels, although it only covered a few years, and is very imperfectly recorded, and in outward form was passed under conditions most remote from the strange complex conditions of our civilisation, yet fits as closely as a glove does to the hand, to all the necessities of our daily lives. Men and women, young men and maidens, old men and children, professional men and students, women in their houses, men of business, merchants, and they that sail the sea and they that dig in the mine; they may all find directions for everything that they have to do, in that one life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And here is the centre and secret of it. ‘Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.’ Therefore that which is the law for Jesus is the law for us, and the next verse goes on; ‘he that loveth hie life shall lose it,’ and the next verse hammers the nail farther in: ‘If any man serve Me, let him follow Me.’ - Take that injunction and apply it, in all the details of daily life, and you will be on the road to reproduce the pattern. But remember the ‘all things.’ It is for us, if we are Christian people, to bring the greatest principles to bear on the smallest duties, ‘Small duties?’ ‘ Great’ and ‘small’ are adjectives that ought never to be tacked on to ‘ duty.’ For all duties are of one size, and while we may speak, and often do speak, very mistakenly about things which we vulgarly consider ‘great,’ or superciliously treat as ‘small,’ the fact is that no man can tell what is a great thing, and what is a small one. For the most important crises in a man’s life have a strange knack of leaping up out of the smallest incidents; just as a whisper may start an avalanche, and so nobody can tell what are the great things and what the small ones. The tiniest pin in a machine drops out, and all the great wheels stop. The small things are the things that for the most part make up life. You can apply Christ’s example to the least of them, and there is very small chance of your applying it to the great things if you have not been in the way of applying it to the small ones. For the small things make the habits which the great ones test and require.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So ‘thorough’ is the word. ‘See that thou make all things according to the pattern.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I remember once going up to the roof of Milan Cathedral, and finding there stowed away behind a buttress - where I suppose one man in fifty years might notice it, a little statuette, as completely chiselled, as perfectly polished, as if it had been of giant size, and set in the facade for all the people in the piazza to see. That is the sort of way in which Christian men should carve out their lives. Finish off the unseen bits perfectly, and then you may be quite sure that the seen bits will take care of themselves. ‘See that thou make all things’ - and begin with the small ones - ‘according to the pattern.’ <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lastly,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Where we are to see the pattern. - ‘Shewed to thee in the mount.’ </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ay, that is where we have to go if we are to see it. The difference between Christian men’s convictions of duty depends largely on the difference in the distance that they have climbed up the hill. The higher you go, the better you see the He of the land. The higher you go, the purer and more wholesome the atmosphere. And many a thing which a Christian man on the low levels thought to be perfectly in accordance with ‘the pattern,’ when he goes up a little higher, he finds to be hopelessly at variance with it. It is of no use to lay down a multitude of minute, red-tape regulations as to what Christian morality requires from people in given circumstances. Go up the hill, and you will see for yourselves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Our elevation determines our range of vision. And the nearer, and the closer, and the deeper is our habitual fellowship with God in Christ, the more lofty will be our conceptions of what we ought to be and do. The reason for inconsistent lives is imperfect communion, mad the higher we go on the mountain of vision, the dearer will be our vision. On the other hand, whilst we see ‘the pattern’ in the mount, we have to come down into the valley to ‘make’ the ‘things.’ The clay and the potter’s wheels are down in Hinnom, and the mountain top is above. You have to carry your pattern- book down, and set to work with it before you. Therefore, whilst the way to see the pattern is to climb, the way to copy it is to descend. And having faithfully copied what you saw on the Mount of Vision, you will see more the next time you go back; for ‘to him that hath shall be given.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who serve </span>— Which priests, according to the Jewish institutions, serve in the temple, which was not yet destroyed; <span class="ital">unto, </span>or, <span class="ital">after, the example, </span>or, <span class="ital">pattern, and shadow of heavenly things — </span>Of gospel mysteries, even of Christ himself, with all that he did and suffered, and still continues to do, including spiritual, evangelical worship, and everlasting glory.

The word <span class="greekheb">υποδειγμα</span>, rendered <span class="ital">example, </span>or <span class="ital">pattern, </span>means somewhat expressed by the strokes pencilled out upon a piece of fine linen, which exhibit the figures of leaves and flowers, but have not yet received their splendid colours and curious shades; and <span class="greekheb">σκια</span>, the word rendered <span class="ital">shadow, </span>is that shadowy representation which gives some dim and imperfect idea of the body; but not the fine features, not the distinguishing air, none of those living graces, which adorn the real person.

God’s direction to Moses to make all according to the pattern showed him, is here appealed to by the apostle with great propriety, as a proof that the priests worshipped God in the tabernacle with a representation and shadow of heavenly things. For, since by this admonition Moses was required not only to make the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry, exactly according to the pattern showed him in the mount, but also, and indeed chiefly, to appoint the services of the priests in the tabernacles according to that pattern, the strictness of the injunction implied that there was some important reason for this exactness. Now what could that reason be, unless the one assigned by the apostle; namely, that the tabernacle was intended to be a shadow of the heavenly holy place, and the services of the tabernacles to be representations of the ministrations of Messiah as a priest in heaven?” Accordingly the tabernacles are called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-23.htm" title="Then called he them in, and lodged them.

He took upon himself human nature, appeared on earth, and there gave himself as a sacrifice to God for the sins of his people. We must not dare to approach God, or to present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending upon his merits and mediation; for we are accepted only in the Beloved. In all obedience and worship, we should keep close to God's word, which is the only and perfect standard. Christ is the substance and end of the law of righteousness. But the covenant here referred to, was that made with Israel as a nation, securing temporal benefits to them. The promises of all spiritual blessings, and of eternal life, revealed in the gospel, and made sure through Christ, are of infinitely greater value. Let us bless God that we have a High Priest that suits our helpless condition.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who serve unto the example - Who perform their service by the mere example and shadow of the heavenly things; or in a tabernacle, and in a mode, that is the mere emblem of the reality which exists in heaven. The reference is to the tabernacle, which was a mere "example" or "copy" of heaven. The word rendered here "example" - &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  hupodeigma - means a "copy, likeness, or imitation." The tabernacle was made after a pattern which was shown to Moses; it was made so as to have some faint resemblance to the reality in heaven, and in that "copy," or "example," they were appointed to officiate. Their service, therefore, had some resemblance to that in heaven.<p>And shadow - That is, in the tabernacle where they served there was a mere shadow of what was real and substantial. Compared with what is in heaven, it was what the shadow is compared with the substance. A shadow - as of a man, a house, a tree, will indicate the form, the outline, the size of the object; but it has no substance, or reality. So it was with the rites of the Jewish religion. They were designed merely as a shadow of the substantial realities of the true religion, or to present the dim outlines of what is true and real in heaven; compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a> note. The word "shadow" here - &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;  skia - is used in distinction from the body or reality - &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  so&#772;ma - (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a>), and also from &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;  eiko&#772;n - a perfect image or resemblance; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>.<p>Of heavenly things - Of the heavenly sanctuary; of what is real and substantial in heaven. That is, there exists in heaven a reality of which the service in the Jewish sanctuary was but the outline. The reference is, undoubtedly, to the service which the Lord Jesus performs there as the great high priest of his people.<p>As Moses was admonished of God - As he was divinely instructed. The word used used - &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  chre&#772;matizo&#772; - means properly to give oracular responses; to make communications to people in a supernatural way - by dreams, by direct revelations, etc.; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-12.htm">Matthew 2:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-22.htm">Matthew 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-26.htm">Luke 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>.<p>For, see, saith he - <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-30.htm">Exodus 26:30</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1-10</a>, it is also repeatedly said that Moses executed all the work of the tabernacle as he had been commanded. Great care was taken that an exact copy should be exhibited to him of all which he was to make, and that the work should be exactly like the pattern. The reason doubtless was, that as the Jewish service was to be typical, none but God could judge of the form in which the tabernacle should be made. It was not to be an edifice of architectural beauty, skill, or taste, but was designed to adumbrate important realities which were known only to God. Hence, it was needful that the exact model of them should be given to Moses, and that it should be scrupulously followed.<p>That thou make all things - Not only the tabernacle itself, but the altars, the ark, the candlestick, etc. The form and materials for each were specified, and the exact pattern shown to Moses in the mount.<p>According to the pattern - Greek &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  tupon - "type;" that is, figure, form. The word &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  tupos, "type," means properly anything produced by the agency or means of "blows" (from &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  tupto&#772;, "to strike"); hence, a mark, stamp, print, impression - as that made by driving nails in the hands <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>; then a figure or form, as of an image or statue <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>; the form of a doctrine or opinion <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17</a>; then an example to be imitated or followed <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>; and hence, a pattern, or model after which anything is to be made; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a>. This is the meaning here. The allusion is to a pattern such as an architect or sculptor uses; a drawing, or figure made in wood or clay, after which the work is to be modelled. The idea is, that some such drawing or model was exhibited to Moses by God on mount Sinai, so that he might have an exact idea of the tabernacle which was to be made. A similar drawing or model of the temple was given by David to Solomon; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-12</a>. We are not indeed to suppose that there was in the case of the pattern shown to Moses, any miniature model of wood or stone actually created and exhibited, but that the form of the tabernacle was exhibited to Moses in vision (note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>), or was so vividly impressed on his mind that he would have a distinct view of the edifice which was to be reared.<p>In the mount - In mount Sinai; for it was while Moses was there in the presence of God, that these communications were made. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

But as in Heb 13:10, "serve the tabernacle," that is, do it service: so "serve (the tabernacle which is but) the outline and shadow."

Things respecting the person, office, and grace of Christ; the priests themselves were types of him; the places they ministered in were an exemplar of the heavenly places, as the word may be rendered, where Christ is; and the things they ministered were shadows of the good things which are by Christ; and the shadows were mere representations; dark, obscure, glimmering ones, and were fleeting and transitory: <p>as Moses was admonished of God; by an oracle; he was a peculiar favourite of God, and was the mediator between God and the people of Israel, and what he received was oracle wise; what he delivered to the people was what he received from God; and what was thus delivered ought to be received as from God: and this admonition or oracle was given him <p>when he was about to make the tabernacle; the Levitical one, with everything appertaining to the worship of God in it: this is ascribed to Moses, though it was made by others, because it was by his direction, and under his care and oversight; and he had this admonition at the beginning of it; and at the finishing of it he looked upon it, and saw that it was all done as the Lord had commanded; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>, <p>for see, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the Mount; Moses was taken up into a mountain with God, even Mount Sinai; and while he was there, a pattern was given him of the tabernacle and all its utensils; this was not a device of his own, but was shown him by God; and this pattern reached to every particular thing; and great care and circumspection were used that the most minute thing answered to it. The Jews think this pattern was given him by the ministry of angels; Gabriel, they say (f), girt himself with a girdle, and showed to Moses the work of the candlestick; and they further say, that an ark of fire, and a table of fire; and a candlestick of fire, descended from heaven, and Moses saw them, and made according to them: from whence it may be observed that the tabernacle, and tabernacle worship, were of divine institution; the ceremonious rites of the Jews were not, as some have affirmed, borrowed from the Egyptians; nor were they given as diversions to that people, nor only to preserve them from idolatry, and keep them separate from others, but were designed to lead them to Christ, whom they were typical of; wherefore the abuse, and not the use of them, were condemned under the former dispensation; though they were to continue no longer than till Christ came, and suffered and died; and now they are abolished: moreover, it may be gathered from hence, that whatever is done in a way of religious worship, should be according to a divine rule; a church of Christ ought to be formed according to the primitive pattern, and should consist, not of all that are born in a nation, province, or parish; nor should all that are born of believing parents be admitted into it; no unholy, unbelieving, and unconverted persons, only such as are true believers in Christ, and who are baptized according as the word of God directs; the officers of a church should be only of two sorts, bishops, elders, pastors or overseers, and deacons; the ordinances are baptism, which should only be administered to believers, and by immersion, and the Lord's supper, of which none should partake, but those who have tasted that the Lord is gracious; and this should be performed as Christ performed it, and as the Apostle Paul received it from him; the discipline of Christ's house should be regarded, and all the laws of it carefully and punctually in execution; and a conversation becoming the Gospel should be attended to. <p>(f) T.

Such questions are otiose, because even if they were worth asking at all they do not admit of any answer, and involve no instruction, and no result of the smallest value. The Palestinian Jews in their slavish literal way said that there was in Heaven an exact literal counterpart of the Mosaic Tabernacle with “a fiery Ark, a fiery Table, a fiery Candlestick,” &c, which descended from heaven for Moses to see; and that Gabriel, in a workman’s apron, shewed Moses how to make the candlestick,—an inference which they founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-4.htm" title="And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, to the shaft thereof, to the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according to the pattern which the LORD had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.">Numbers 8:4</a>, “And <span class="ital">this</span> work of the candlestick” (Menachoth, f. 29. 1). Without any such fetish-worship of the letter it is quite enough to accept the simple statement that Moses worked after a pattern which God had brought before his mind. The chief historical interest in the verse is the fact that it was made the basis for the Scriptural Idealism by which Philo and the Alexandrian Jews tried to combine Judaism with the Platonic philosophy, and to treat the whole material world as a shadow of the spiritual world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑποδείγματι καὶ σκιᾷ</span>) A Hendyadys.

All that is necessarily implied is that he was divinely admonished to make the tabernacle after the fashion conveyed, in whatever way, to his apprehension when on the mount, so that it might be a true representation of some heavenly reality (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>The connection is, "there are those who offer the gifts according to the law, such as (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) serve," etc. For &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; serve, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>.

The meaning is that, in all essential features, the Levitical system of worship was a copy of a heavenly reality. This was pressed into an absurd literalism by the Rabbins, who held that there were in heaven original models of the tabernacle and of all its appurtenances, and that these were shown to Moses in the Mount. The writer draws out of this vulgar conception the thought that the material tabernacle was an emblem of a spiritual, heavenly sanctuary. The Levitical priests, therefore, serve only a copy and shadow. </body></html>
