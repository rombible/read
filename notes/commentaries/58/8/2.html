It is difficult, however, to decide on the meaning of the words here joined with it—whether they denote holy things or holy place; if the latter, what is the distinction between this holy place and “the true tabernacle”? The ordinary usage of the Epistle would suggest “holy place,” and perhaps the occurrence of both expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a> (where there is no doubt as to the translation) is sufficient to remove any hesitation here. The “sanctuary,” therefore, will probably be the heavenly counterpart of the Holiest Place; the “true (or, <span class= "ital">real</span>) Tabernacle,” the counterpart of the sacred Tent of Moses, containing both the Holy Place and the Holiest of all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2-4</a>). It is not certain that in this place we need go beyond this point, though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a> the more developed thought may require a closer interpretation. The Holy of Holies is the place of God’s immediate presence; the Tabernacle, that of God’s appointed service. The latter is expressly mentioned here because special reference is to be made to its typical representation upon earth; this is shown by the following words, which point to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.">Exodus 33:7</a>. The word rendered “true” (which occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>) is full of interest, denoting that which is contrasted with everything shadowy or imperfect or merely typical; it is a word especially characteristic of the Gospel of St. John.

He took upon himself human nature, appeared on earth, and there gave himself as a sacrifice to God for the sins of his people. We must not dare to approach God, or to present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending upon his merits and mediation; for we are accepted only in the Beloved. In all obedience and worship, we should keep close to God's word, which is the only and perfect standard. Christ is the substance and end of the law of righteousness. But the covenant here referred to, was that made with Israel as a nation, securing temporal benefits to them. The promises of all spiritual blessings, and of eternal life, revealed in the gospel, and made sure through Christ, are of infinitely greater value. Let us bless God that we have a High Priest that suits our helpless condition.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A minister of the sanctuary - Margin, "or holy things."

The word "sanctuary" - &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  qodesh - was given to the tabernacle or temple as a "holy place," and the plural form which is used here - &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  ta hagia - was given to the most holy place by way of eminence - the full form of the name being - &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  qodesh  &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  qodesh qoda&#770;shiym, or, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  hagia hagio&#772;n - "hagia hagion," (Jahn's Arche. section 328), or as it is used here simply as &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  ta hagia. The connection seems to require us to understand it of the "most holy place," and not of holy things. The idea is, that the Lord Jesus the Great High Priest, has entered into the Holy of Holies in heaven, of which that in the tabernacle was an emblem. For a description of the Most Holy place in the temple, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>.<p>And of the true tabernacle - The "real" tabernacle in heaven, of which that among the Hebrews was but the type. The word "tabernacle" - &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;  ske&#772;ne&#772; - means properly a "booth, hut, or tent," and was applied to the "tent" which Moses was directed to build as the place for the worship of God. That tabernacle, as the temple was afterward, was regarded as the special abode of God on earth. Here the reference is to heaven, as the dwelling place of God, of which that tabernacle was the emblem or symbol. It is called the "true tabernacle," as it is the real dwelling of God, of which the one made by Moses was but the "emblem." It is not moveable and perishable like that made by man, but is unchanging and eternal.<p>Which the Lord pitched, and not man - The word "pitched" is adapted to express the setting up of a "tent." When it is said that "the Lord pitched the true tabernacle," that is, the permanent dwelling in heaven; the meaning is, that heaven has been prepared by God himself, and that whatever is necessary to constitute that an appropriate abode for the divine majesty has been done by him. To that glorious dwelling the Redeemer has been received, and there he performs the office of high priest in behalf of man. In what way he does this, the apostle specifies in the remainder of this chapter, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9.htm">Hebrews 9-10</a>: <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. minister&#8212;The Greek term implies priestly ministry in the temple.<p>the sanctuary&#8212;Greek, "the holy places"; the Holy of Holies. Here the heavenly sanctuary is meant.<p>the true&#8212;the archetypal and antitypical, as contrasted with the typical and symbolical (Heb 9:24). Greek "alethinos" (used here) is opposed to that which does not fulfil its idea, as for instance, a type; "alethes," to that which is untrue and unreal, as a lie. The measure of alethes is reality; that of alethinos, ideality. In alethes the idea corresponds to the thing; in alethinos, the thing to the idea [Kalmis in Alford].<p>tabernacle&#8212;(Heb 9:11). His body. Through His glorified body as the tabernacle, Christ passes into the heavenly "Holy of Holies," the immediate immaterial presence of God, where He intercedes for us. This tabernacle in which God dwells, is where God in Christ meets us who are "members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones." This tabernacle answers to the heavenly Jerusalem, where God's visible presence is to be manifested to His perfected saints and angels, who are united in Christ the Head; in contradistinction to His personal invisible presence in the Holy of Holies unapproachable save to Christ. Joh 1:14, "Word &#8230; dwelt among us," Greek, "tabernacled."<p>pitched&#8212;Greek, "fixed" firmly.<p>not man&#8212;as Moses (Heb 8:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A minister; </span> this is spoken of the High Priest sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens, and relates to that work of his whereby he was constituted leitourgov which, according to Suidas, is compounded of two words, para to lhion <span class="ital">vel</span> lhiton ergon, public work; so as it might be rendered administrator, and notes any public officer from the highest to the lowest. The Spirit of God in the New Testament hath applied it to the highest and subordinate ministry; in this verse to Christ himself in his exalted state, and so notes a ruler, as he was now God’s published, settled King, the Lord Administrator of all things in his kingdom, agreeably to what he foretold, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>,7 110:1</span>; compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a></span>.

For heaven is the place, the sanctuary, wherein saints the persons for whom, and all holy endowments the matter about which, he administers, do descend. But the holy house, or <span class="ital">sanctuary, </span> is the proper import of it; and so, though expressed in the plural number, to all the holy parts of its types, the temple and tabernacle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And of the true tabernacle:</span> some, because of the connection of this to the former word, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">sanctuary, </span> would have it import the same thing, even heaven; but the Spirit distinguisheth these from each other, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1</a>,2</span>. Some would understand it of the body of Christ, but here not so properly and agreeably to what the Spirit is speaking of. But by <span class="ital">tabernacle, </span> here, is meant Christ mystical, the true temple, church, and habitation of God on earth. For as Christ was the body and truth by all the shadows and types of the tabernacle, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm" title=" Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.">Colossians 2:17</a></span>, so not all one way. Some of the types were single, and terminated on his person, as priesthood, sacrifice, altar, shew-bread, incense, ark of the covenant, &c. Other types were aggregate, and compounded of many things, as tent, sanctuary, and tabernacle here; parallel to this, there must be a truth in Christ complex, that is, Christ the church, so framed and pitched a house by God, that he may dwell in it. The apostle so interprets it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>,17 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a></span>; compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>,21 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1 Peter 2:4</a>,5</span>. Christ in person is its foundation; saints are the several living materials, of which the house and tabernacle is made; their dispositions, graces, and endowments, the ornaments of it; the laws, rules, orders, ordinances, are the cement, the cords and stakes that join them together; and the glory of God fills it, as it did the tabernacle and temple, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm" title="And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:7</a>,9 Re 21:23</span>.

The reason of this interpretation is evident. A tabernacle is God’s habitation; the Christian church is such, it answers in all parts, and bears its proportion to the complex type, and cannot fully be matched by any other things: it is congruous to Christ’s session in glory; for thence he doth, as the honourable and glorious Administrator of God’s church, order and manage all on it according to his will, having settled in his true tabernacle a ministry, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men....">Ephesians 4:8-13</a></span>, covenant, as below, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises....">Hebrews 8:6-13</a></span>, service, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a>,5</span>, and privileges, far exceeding its type: all which this grand officer, as the only royal High Priest and Head of his church, Prophet of his people, orders by his Spirit, the only Vicar he useth in it. Of this true tabernacle, church, or house of God, the sovereign, independent, omnipotent, infinitely wise and holy, the eternal Lord, was the author; and such is his work as no other can question it, can add to or alter it, can reach it, so proportioned is it to its Framer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which the Lord pitched; </span> ephzen he framed and prepared every piece that constituteth this tabernacle himself, as the materials of the first were wrought by his pattern and order.

The Alexandrian Jews, as well as the Christian scholars of Alexandria, had adopted from Plato the doctrine of Ideas, which they regarded as divine and eternal archetypes of which material and earthly things were but the imperfect copies. They found their chief support for this introduction of Platonic views into the interpretation of the Bible in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-30.htm" title="And you shall raise up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 26:30</a> (quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>). Accordingly they regarded the Mosaic tabernacle as a mere sketch, copy, or outline of the Divine Idea or Pattern. The Idea is the perfected Reality of its material shadow. They extended this conception much farther:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“What if earth<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Be but the shadow of heaven, and things therein<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Each to the other like, more than on earth is thought?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “genuine tabernacle” is the Heavenly Ideal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>) shewn to Moses.

But what is the <span class="accented">true</span> tabernacle, in which Christ ministers? Are we to suppose that an actual prototype of the earthly tabernacle is regarded as existing locally beyond the sky? No; it is only implied that there are, in the suprasensuous sphere, facts and relations which are symbolized and made level to our comprehension by local imagery. Still, there may be conceived as present to the writer's mind an ideal picture of a heavenly temple, such as was seen in vision by prophets, and served to aid their conception of realities beyond their ken. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>, where the thunderstorm is described, the LORD is conceived, in the introductory and concluding verses, as enthroned above it in his heavenly temple, sitting there a King for ever, and worshipped by the "sons of God." Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a> Michaiah sees in vision "the Loud sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him, on his right hand and on his left." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. this throne is seen as the distinct counterpart of the mercy-seat in the earthly temple, with the winged forms above it, and the "house" filled with the smoke of incense, and live coals upon the altar. Ezekiel's still more remarkable visions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1, 10, 11</a>.) are in like manner enlargements of the idea of the Shechinah in the holy of holies (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>:20). Then the visions of St. John in the Revelation have the same basis; there is still seen a glorious counterpart above of the temple below; though now with new accessories, expressive of accomplished redemption. But that St. John's visions are meant only as imagery representing the incomprehensible is evident throughout, and especially from the ideal description of the holy city in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, in which ver. 22 is peculiarly significant: "And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it." In the same way is to be understood the "true tabernacle." If, as we may suppose, the writer had before his mind the prophetic visions of such a heavenly temple, he entertains them only as imaging spiritual facts and relations in the regions of eternity. "Which the Lord pitched," etc., may have reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A minister (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Sat down as a minister.
