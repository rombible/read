The law not only made all subject to it, liable to be condemned for the guilt of sin, but also was unable to remove that guilt, and clear the conscience from the sense and terror of it. Whereas, by the blood of Christ, a full remission of sins was provided, so that God would remember them no more. God once wrote his laws to his people, now he will write his laws in them; he will give them understanding to know and to believe his laws; he will give them memories to retain them; he will give them hearts to love them, courage to profess them, and power to put them in practice. This is the foundation of the covenant; and when this is laid, duty will be done wisely, sincerely, readily, easily, resolutely, constantly, and with comfort. A plentiful outpouring of the Spirit of God will make the ministration of the gospel so effectual, that there shall be a mighty increase and spreading of Christian knowledge in persons of all sorts. Oh that this promise might be fulfilled in our days, that the hand of God may be with his ministers so that great numbers may believe, and be turned to the Lord! The pardon of sin will always be found to accompany the true knowledge of God. Notice the freeness of this pardon; its fulness; its fixedness. This pardoning mercy is connected with all other spiritual mercies: unpardoned sin hinders mercy, and pulls down judgments; but the pardon of sin prevents judgment, and opens a wide door to all spiritual blessings. Let us search whether we are taught by the Holy Spirit to know Christ, so as uprightly to love, fear, trust, and obey him. All worldly vanities, outward privileges, or mere notions of religion, will soon vanish away, and leave those who trust in them miserable for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not according to the covenant ... - An arrangement or dispensation relating mainly to outward observances, and to temporal blessings. The meaning is, that the new dispensation would be different from what was made with them when they came out of Egypt. In what respects it would differ is specified in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10-12</a>.<p>Because they continued not in my covenant - In Jeremiah, in the Hebrew, this is, "while my covenant they brake." That is, they failed to comply with the conditions on which I promised to bestow blessings upon them. In Jeremiah this is stated as a simple fact; in the manner in which the apostle quotes it, it is given as a reason why he would give a new arrangement. The apostle has quoted it literally from the Septuagint, and the sense is not materially varied. The word rendered "because" - &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  hoti - may mean "since" - "since they did not obey that covenant, and it was ineffectual in keeping them from sin, showing that it was not perfect or complete in regard to what was needful to be done for man, a new arrangement shall be made that will be without defect." This accords with the reasoning of the apostle; and the idea is, simply, that an arrangement may be made for man adapted to produce important ends in one state of society or one age of the world, which would not be well adapted to him in another, and which would not accomplish all which it would be desirable to accomplish for the race. So an arrangement may be made for teaching children which would not answer the purpose of instructing those of mature years, and which at that time of life may be superseded by another. A system of measures may be adapted to the infancy of society, or to a comparatively rude period of the world, which would be ill adapted to a more advanced state of society. Such was the Hebrew system. It was well adapted to the Jewish community in their circumstances, and answered the end then in view. It served to keep them separate from other people; to preserve the knowledge and the worship of the true God, and to introduce the gospel dispensation.<p>And I regarded them not - In Jeremiah this is, "Although I was an husband unto them." The Septuagint is as it is quoted here by Paul. The Hebrew is, &#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; &#1489;&#1510;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;&#1501;  wa'aanokiy baa&#8219;altiy baam - which may be rendered, "although I was their Lord;" or as it is translated by Gesenius, "and I rejected them." The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;  ba&#768;al - means:<p>(1) to be lord or master over anything <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-13.htm">Isaiah 26:13</a>;<p>(2) to become the husband of anyone <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>;<p>(3) with ba-, "to disdain, to reject"; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. It is very probable that this is the meaning here, for it is not only adopted by the Septuagint, but by the Syriac. So Abulwalid, Kimchi, and Rabbi Tanchum understood it.<p>The Arabic word means "to reject, to loath, to disdain." All that is necessary to observe here is, that it cannot be demonstrated that the apostle has not given the true sense of the prophet. The probability is, that the Septuagint translators would give the meaning which was commonly understood to be correct, and there is still more probability that the Syriac translator would adopt the true sense, for.<p>(1) the Syriac and Hebrew languages strongly resemble each other; and,<p>(2) the old Syriac version - the Peshito - is incomparably a better translation than the Septuagint.<p>If this, therefore, be the correct translation, the meaning is, that since they did not regard and obey the laws which he gave them, God would reject them as his people, and give new laws better adapted to save people. Instead of regarding and treating them as his friends, he would punish them for their offences, and visit them with calamities. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Paul's translation here is supported by the Septuagint, Syriac, and Gesenius, and accords with the kindred Arabic. The Hebrews regarded not God, so God, in righteous retribution, regarded them not. On "continued not in my covenant," Schelling observes: The law was in fact the mere ideal of a religious constitution: in practice, the Jews were throughout, before the captivity, more or less polytheists, except in the time of David, and the first years of Solomon (the type of Messiah's reign). Even after the return from Babylon, idolatry was succeeded by what was not much better, formalism and hypocrisy (Mt 12:43). The law was (1) a typical picture, tracing out the features of the glorious Gospel to be revealed; (2) it had a delegated virtue from the Gospel, which ceased, therefore, when the Gospel came.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Spirit proceedeth to show the form of the covenant denied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers; </span> not the same covenant for habit or form, nor any like unto the same for the manner of its administration, as was made by the Lord with the Hebrews their progenitors, when they were strangers in Egypt, and under great bondage there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the day when I took them by the hand; </span> the day that I laid my hand on them, and took hold of theirs, even the last day of the four hundred and thirty years foretold to Abraham, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a>,16</span>; compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>,41</span>; as a father takes hold of his child to pluck it out of danger. It is a metaphor setting out God’s special act of providence, in their miraculous deliverance out of Egypt, keeping them in his hand, while he was smiting their enemies; setting them at liberty, and then striking covenant with them, and binding them by it to be his obedient people, as such redemption mercy did deserve. At which time the covenant was unlike the promise or gospel one for external habit and form only, as carried on by a ceremonial law and priesthood, over which Christ’s was to have the pre-eminency for power and efficacy of administration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because they continued not in my covenant; </span> these unbelieving Hebrews, under that administration of the covenant, continued not faithful to it, as by their own word and consent they bound themselves to it, but apostatized from God and his truth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-27.htm" title="Go you near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak you to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to you; and we will hear it, and do it.">Deu 5:27</a></span>. The word used by the prophet Nrph signifieth the breaking and making void the covenant. The administration of it did not hold them in close to God, but they frustrated all God’s ordinances, turned idolaters, forsook the Lord, and worshipped the gods of the nations round about. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And I regarded them not; </span> hmelhsa, I took no care of them, I did neither esteem nor regard them, but cast them off from being my people for their lewd, treacherous covenant-breaking with me; they would not return unto me, and I rejected them from being my people, or a people as they were before. Who knows where the nine tribes and the half are? And in what a dispersed, shattered condition are the remaining Jews to this day! The apostle in this follows the Septuagint, who read the effect of their sin, their rejection, for what was their sin itself, which by the prophet is expressed yhleb ybzaw should I be a Lord or Husband to them; which is an aggravation of their sin from God’s dominion over them or marriage-relation to them; yet did they break his marriage-covenant with them according to their lewd and whorish heart: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/16-1.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,...">Ezekiel 16:1-63</a>,23:1-49</span>.

The ancestors of the Jews at Mount Sinai: <p>in the day when I took then, by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; which is mentioned, not only to observe the time when the former covenant was made with the Israelites, which was just upon their deliverance out of Egypt; but also to show their weakness and inability to have delivered themselves, and the tenderness of God towards them; they were like children, they could not help themselves when God took them by the hand, and brought them forth with an outstretched arm; and likewise to expose their ingratitude, and vindicate his conduct towards them: <p>because they continued not in my covenant; though they promised, at the reading of it, that all that the Lord had said, they would hear and do; but their hearts were not right with God, and they were not steadfast in his covenant, and therefore their carcasses fell in the wilderness: <p>and I regarded them not, saith the Lord; the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a> are very differently rendered in our translation, "although I was an husband unto them": and so it becomes an aggravation of their sin of ingratitude, in not continuing in his covenant: in the margin it is rendered interrogatively, "should I have continued an husband unto them?" that is, after they had so treated him, no; as if he should say, I will not behave towards them as such; I will reject them, and disregard them. The Chaldee paraphrase is just the reverse of the apostle's translation, "and I was well pleased with them": some render them, "I ruled over them", as a lord over his servants, in a very severe manner. Others, observing the great difference there is between the Hebrew text, and the apostle's version, have supposed a different Hebrew copy from the present, used by the Septuagint, or the apostle, in which, instead of  it was read either  or  but there is no need of such a supposition, since Dr. Pocock (g) has shown, that  in the Arabic language, signifies to loath and abhor, and so to disregard; and Kimchi (h) relates it as a rule laid down by his father, that wherever this word is used in construction with  it is to be taken in an ill part, and signifies the same as  "I have loathed"; in which sense that word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-8.htm">Zechariah 11:8</a> and so here, I have loathed them, I abhorred them, I rejected them, I took no care of them, disregarded them, left their house desolate, and suffered wrath to come upon them to the uttermost. <p>(g) Not.

Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>).—<span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ οὐκ ἐνέμειναν ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ μου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κᾀγὼ ἠμέλησα αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard</span> (<span class="ital">care for</span>) <span class="ital">them</span>) Correlatives, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm" title="For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:">Hebrews 8:10</a>, from the opposite, <span class="ital">I will be to them a</span> GOD, <span class="ital">and they shall be to Me a people;</span> but the method of proceeding is now reversed: the people had begun first to put an end to the covenant: God both begins and perfects all things in the new covenant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-10.htm" title="For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:...">Hebrews 8:10-11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">κᾀγὼ ἠμέλησα αὐτῶν</span>) LXX., <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγὼ ἠμέλησα αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">and I did not regard them</span>. <span class="greekheb">ואנכי בעלתי בם</span>, and I ruled over them; although some claim for the verb <span class="greekheb">בעל</span>, the meaning <span class="greekheb">געל</span>, disregard, from the Arabic idiom. God’s ruling and disregard may, in some measure, be reconciled in this view: I treated them as if they were not Mine; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a> : nor was I propitious to their sins; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-19.htm" title="And it come to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:">Deuteronomy 29:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>, etc. They are not regarded over whom such lordly rule is exercised; they do not rejoice in (are not privileged with) that access, in which those who are in covenant or in friendship rejoice; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-15.htm" title="From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.">John 15:15</a> : but they are treated as slaves; nor are they held in great consideration, whatever may befall them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-6.htm" title="Why thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.">Ezekiel 24:6</a>, at the end; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/15-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth....">Jeremiah 15:1-2</a>.

The Hebrew Masters, as Surenhusius shows, in <span class="greekheb">βίβλῷ καταλλαγῆς</span>, p. 628, understand the word <span class="greekheb">בעלתי</span> to apply to the dominion of love and good pleasure; and it is not, save by an error in writing, that they turn it into the contrary, <span class="greekheb">בחלתי</span>, I have disdained or disregarded (fastidivi).
