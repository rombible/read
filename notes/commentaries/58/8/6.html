(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a>.) We have here another of those proportional statements commented on in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.">Hebrews 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>. The last of these passages is closely akin to this. There we read that by how much the Priest appointed by the divine oath is raised above all other priests, by so much is His covenant better than theirs. Here, that as He is Mediator of a better covenant, in the same proportion does His ministry excel that of priests on earth.<p><span class= "bld">Which was established.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">one that hath been ordained.</span> The verb, properly meaning “to legislate,” has already occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>, “the people hath received the Law” (literally, <span class= "ital">hath been legislated for</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Here, then, a word which properly refers to the passing of a law is applied to a covenant. The explanation must be sought in the special nature of the covenants of God with man (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>), which are not compacts between equals, but arrangements offered by the divine goodness, and made dependent upon conditions. Hence such a covenant may be spoken of as ordained, enacted, on the basis of promise. On the promises (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:">Hebrews 8:8-12</a>) which are given by God is based the “covenant” which becomes the law of His kingdom and the declaration of His procedure. The man who accepts the promises by entering into the conditions laid down is dealt with according to this law. Here, Jesus is the “Mediator,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a> (see Note) the “Surety,” of the better covenant. The idea is expanded below in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-18</a>. On the tacit comparison with Moses, as mediator of the first covenant, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises....">Hebrews 8:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">But now, </span>&c. — In this verse begins the second part of the chapter concerning the difference between the two covenants, the old and the new, with the pre-eminence of the latter to the former, and of the ministry of Christ to that of the Jewish high-priests. <span class="ital">He hath obtained a more excellent ministry, </span>&c. — His priesthood as much excels theirs as the promises of the gospel, whereof he is a surety, excelled those of the law; or, the excellence of his ministry above that of the Levitical priests is in proportion to the excellence of the covenant, whereof he is the Mediator, above the old covenant wherein they had ministered. With this argument the apostle closes his long discourse respecting the pre-eminence of Christ in his office above the high-priests of old, a subject to which he could not give too much evidence, nor too full a confirmation, considering that it was the very hinge on which his whole controversy with the Jews depended. <span class="ital">For if that first covenant had been faultless </span>— If that dispensation had answered all God’s designs and man’s wants, if it had not been weak and unprofitable; <span class="ital">then should no place, </span>&c. — “Although the Sinai covenant was well calculated to preserve the Jews from idolatry, and to give them the knowledge of their duty, it was faulty or imperfect in the following respects: 1st, The rites of worship which it enjoined, sanctified only to the purifying of the flesh, but not the consciences of the worshippers. 2d, These rites could be performed nowhere but in the tabernacle, or in the temple, consequently they could not be the religion of mankind. 3d, This covenant had no real sacrifices for sin, consequently it granted no pardon to any sinner. 4th, Its promises were all of a temporal kind. 5th, It required an unsinning obedience, which, in our present state, no one can give; and threatened death for every offence. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>. <span class="ital">No place have been sought for the second </span>— Since the <span class="ital">first covenant </span>is that which God made with the Israelites at Sinai by the publication of the law, the <span class="ital">second covenant </span>must be that which was made with mankind in general, by the publication of the gospel. Accordingly the publication of the gospel was foretold, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>,) under the idea of <span class="ital">making a new covenant with the house of Israel, </span>&c., and the gospel itself is called (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>,) <span class="ital">the law which went forth from Zion. </span>But it is to be observed, that the law of Moses is called the <span class="ital">first covenant, </span>not merely because it was prior to the gospel, but also because it was in some respects the same with the first covenant under which Adam was placed in paradise; for, like it, it required perfect obedience (in many cases) under the penalty of death, and allowed no pardon to any sinner, however penitent. It is likewise to be observed, that the gospel is called the <span class="ital">second covenant, </span>not merely because it was posterior to the law, but also because it is actually the same with the second covenant under which Adam was placed after the fall; for it requires, not a sinless, but a sincere obedience, and grants pardon to sinners on their repentance, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm" title="For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.">Galatians 3:10</a>. However, though the rigour of the first covenant, (which, properly speaking, was the law of nature written on Adam’s heart,) was mitigated under the second or gospel covenant, by the abolition of its curse, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>,) its obligation, as a rule of life, never was, nor ever could be cancelled, but its [moral] precepts have constantly remained in force. Hence all the sins which men commit, and which are pardoned under the second covenant, are very properly called <span class="ital">transgressions </span>of the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-6 The substance, or summary, of what had been declared was, that Christians had such a High Priest as they needed. He took upon himself human nature, appeared on earth, and there gave himself as a sacrifice to God for the sins of his people. We must not dare to approach God, or to present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending upon his merits and mediation; for we are accepted only in the Beloved. In all obedience and worship, we should keep close to God's word, which is the only and perfect standard. Christ is the substance and end of the law of righteousness. But the covenant here referred to, was that made with Israel as a nation, securing temporal benefits to them. The promises of all spiritual blessings, and of eternal life, revealed in the gospel, and made sure through Christ, are of infinitely greater value. Let us bless God that we have a High Priest that suits our helpless condition.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now hath he obtained - That is, Christ.<p>A more excellent ministry - A service of a higher order, or of a more exalted nature. It was the real and substantial service of which the other was but the emblem; it pertained to things in heaven, while that was concerned with the earthly tabernacle; it was enduring, while that was to vanish away; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-9</a>.<p>By how much - By as much as the new covenant is more important than the old, by so much does his ministry exceed in dignity that under the ancient dispensation.<p>He is the mediator - see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19-20</a>, where the word "mediator" is explained. It means here that Christ officiates between God and man according to the arrangements of the new covenant.<p>Of a better covenant - Margin, "Or testament." This word properly denotes a "disposition, arrangement, or ordering" of things; and in the Scriptures is employed to describe the arrangement which God has made to secure the maintenance of his worship on earth, and the salvation of people. It is uniformly used in the Septuagint and in the New Testament to denote the covenant which God makes with people. The word which "properly" denotes a "covenant or compact" - &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;  sunthe&#772;ke&#772; - "suntheke" is never used. The writers of the New Testament evidently derived its use from the Septuagint, but why the authors of that version employed it as denoting a "will" rather than the proper one denoting a "compact," is unknown. It has been supposed by some, and the conjecture is not wholly improbable, that it was because they were unwilling to represent God as making a "compact" or "agreement" with people, but chose rather to represent him as making a mere "arrangement or ordering of things;"  compare the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-8.htm">Hebrews 8:8</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-16.htm">Hebrews 9:16-17</a>. This is a better covenant than the old, inasmuch as it relates mainly to the pardon of sin; to a spiritual and holy religion; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>. The former related more to external rites and observances, and was destined to vanish away; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>.<p>Which was established upon better promises - The promises in the first covenant pertained mainly to the present life. They were promises of length of days; of increase of numbers; of seed time and harvest; of national privileges, and of extraordinary peace, abunance, and prosperity. That there was also the promise of eternal life, it would be wrong to doubt; but this was not the main thing. In the new covenant, however, the promise of spiritual blessings becomes the principal thing. The mind is directed to heaven; the heart is cheered with the hopes of immortal life, the favor of God and the anticipation of heaven are secured in the most ample and solemn manner. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. now&#8212;not time; but "as it is."<p>more excellent ministry&#8212;than any earthly ministry.<p>by how much&#8212;in proportion as.<p>mediator&#8212;coming between us and God, to carry into effect God's covenant with us.

"Like a physician who prescribes a certain diet to a patient, and then when the patient is beginning to recover, changes the diet, permitting what he had before forbidden; or as a teacher gives his pupil an elementary lesson at first; preparatory to leading him to a higher stage": so Rabbi Albo in his Ikkarim. Compare Jer 7:21, 22, which shows that God's original design in the old covenant ritual system was, that it should be pedagogical, as a schoolmaster leading and preparing men for Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry:</span> <span class="ital">but</span> is here adversative, setting this High Priest over against and above the Aaronical, on the account both of his ministry and covenant, of which theirs were but types and shadows.

Christ has a ministry, he is the minister of the sanctuary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm">Hebrews 8:2</a> he has "obtained" this ministry of his Father; he was called unto it and engaged in it by him; and he has "now" obtained it; for though he was called to it from eternity, it was in time he came an high priest of good things, to come; and his ministry is <p>a more excellent one than that of the priests, who offered gifts according to the law and served to the example and shadow of heavenly things; as abundantly appears from the preceding chapter, and from this, as well, as from what follows: <p>by how much also he is the Mediator of a better covenant; the covenant of grace, as administered under the Gospel dispensation; which is not only better than the covenant of works, that being conditional, this absolute; that stood on the foot of works, this on the foot of grace, and is established in Christ; that being broken and made void, this continues; and not only better than the covenant of the Levitical priesthood, which was but a typical one, and is now ceased, but also than the covenant of grace, as administered under the legal dispensation; being better than that, as to the manner of its manifestation, which is more full and clear; and as to the extent of its administration, reaching to Gentiles as well as Jews; and as to the ratification of it by the blood of Christ, called from thence the blood of the everlasting covenant; and as to the promises of it, here said to be better: <p>which was established upon better promises; which are not now delivered out as before, under the figure of earthly and temporal things; nor under a condition to be performed nor confined to a particular people and nation; and which are attended with a greater measure of the Spirit, to open and apply them; and are all secured in Christ Jesus, and confirmed by his blood: and now of this covenant Christ is the "Mediator"; a mediator is of more persons than one, and of these at variance; and he is a middle person between both; and his business is to bring both parties together, and make peace between them: the two parties in this case are God and man, set at a distance from each other by the sin of man, whereby man is become enmity to God; Christ is the Mediator between God and man, a middle person between both, being both God and man, the daysman, who lays his hands on both; who brings men to God that were afar off, and makes peace for them by the blood of his cross, and satisfies the justice of God, which he has done by the sacrifice of himself; and now appears in the presence of God for them, and intercedes for them, and applies the blessings of the covenant to them by his Spirit, and keeps and preserves them safe to his everlasting kingdom;

The word here used is not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("surety"), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> ("mediator"); on which it is to be observed that the mediator of the old covenant was not Aaron, but Moses (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>): it was he that intervened between God and the congregation in the establishment of the covenant; and thus, in this respect also, the priesthood of the new covenant transcends the old one, in that (as was shown also in the earlier part of the Epistle) the type of Moses, as well as of Aaron, is fulfilled in it. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("established" in A.V.; "enacted" in the recent R.V.) expresses the promulgation of a <span class="accented">law - appositely</span> in the first place to the Law of Moses, which constituted the conditions of the old covenant; but also to the description of the new covenant, which follows from Jeremiah, according to which the <span class="accented">law</span> remains, but to be written on the heart. The gospel is elsewhere regarded under the idea of <span class="accented">law</span>, though not a law of bondage, but of liberty - a law, not of the letter, but of the Spirit (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-31.htm">Romans 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>). The "better promises" are such as the passage from Jeremiah, quoted below, notably represents. Other passages might be referred to (such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 37:24, etc.), of similar significance, though not with the same marked mention of a new <span class="accented">covenant</span> to supersede the old one. This memorable passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-35</a>) occurs in a distinct section of Jeremiah's prophecies (30, 31.), delivered after the commencement of the Captivity, and directed to be written in a book. The subject of the whole section is the restoration of Israel, its ultimate Messianic reference being patent to all who acknowledge any such at all in prophecy. In evidence of this there is not only the passage before us, pointing to an entirely new covenant with Israel, and the ideal tone of the whole prophecy, but also, in particular, the view of all the scattered tribes, not Judah only - the whole ideal Israel - being gathered together from all countries to Zion, and of David himself to rule over them as king. The national and local framework, which the picture has in common with other prophetic visions of the coming days, is of course no difficulty to those familiar with the style of the prophetic books. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But now (&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;)<p>&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;is logical: as the case now stands.

"If he were on earth he could not be a priest," etc., but now, since Christ is a priest, and must have a sanctuary and an offering, he has a more excellent ministry.<p>He hath obtained a more excellent ministry (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>The ministry of the heavenly sanctuary.<p>He is the mediator of a better covenant (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>For &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; mediator, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>. Both here and in the following chapter, the ideas of the sanctuary and the covenant are closely united. God's covenant was embodied in the sanctuary. The ark was "the ark of the covenant"; the tables of the law were "the tables of the covenant." The essence of a covenant is the establishment of a relationship. The sanctuary was the meeting-place of God and man. The ritual of sacrifice adjusted the sinner's relation to a holy God. All the furniture and all the ordinances of the tabernacle assumed the covenant between God and his people. Thus the two ideas belong together. The minister of the Levitical sanctuary was the mediator of the old covenant. A new covenant implies a new ministry, a better covenant implies a better ministry. Christ's priesthood implies a sanctuary. The new sanctuary implies a new covenant. This covenant is a better covenant because it<p>Was established upon better promises (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>For established rend. enacted. &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to enact a law, only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11</a>.
