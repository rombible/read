Christian experience is a spiritual sense, taste, or relish of the goodness, sweetness, and excellence of the truths of the gospel.

You have been Christians long enough to he expected to understand such doctrines. This verse proves that those to whom he wrote were not recent converts.<p>Ye ought to be teachers - You ought to be able to instruct others. He does not mean to say, evidently, that they ought all to become public teachers, or preachers of the gospel, but that they ought to be able to explain to others the truths of the Christian religion. As parents they ought to be able to explain them to their children; as neighbors, to their neighbors; or as friends, to those who were inquiring the way to life.<p>Ye have need - That is, probably, the mass of them had need. As a people, or a church, they had shown that they were ignorant of some of the very elements of the gospel.<p>Again - This shows that they "had been" taught on some former occasion what were the first principles of religion, but they had not followed, up the teaching as they ought to have done.<p>The first principles - The very elements; the rudiments; the first lessons - such as children learn before they advance to higher studies. See the word used here explained in the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>, under the word "elements." The Greek word is the same.<p>Of the oracles of God - Of the Scriptures, or what God has spoken; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>. The phrase here may refer to the writings of the Old Testament, and particularly to those parts which relate to the Messiah; or it may include all that God had at that time revealed in whatever way it was preserved; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>, it is used with reference to the Christian religion, and to the doctrines which God had revealed in the gospel. In the passage before us, it may mean" the divine oracles or communications," in whatever way they had been made known. They had shown that they were ignorant of the very rudiments of the divine teaching.<p>And are become such - There is more meant in this phrase than that they simply "were" such persons. The word rendered "are become" - &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  ginomai - sometimes implies "a change of state," or a passing from one state to another - well expressed by the phrase "are become;" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm">Matthew 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-17.htm">Mark 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3-4</a>. The idea here is, that they had passed from the hopeful condition in which they were when they showed that they had an acquaintance with the great principles of the gospel, and that they had become such as to need again the most simple form of instruction. This agrees well with the general strain of the Epistle, which is to preserve them from the danger of apostasy. They were verging toward it, and had come to that state where if they were recovered it must be by being again taught the elements of religion.<p>Have need of milk - Like little children. You can bear only the most simple nourishment. The meaning is, that they were incapable of receiving the higher doctrines of the gospel as much as little children are incapable of digesting solid food. They were in fact in a state of spiritual infancy.<p>And not of strong meat - Greek. "Strong food." The word "meat" with us is used now to denote only animal food. Formerly it meant food in general. The Greek word here means "nourishment." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. for the time&#8212;considering the long time that you have been Christians. Therefore this Epistle was not one of those written early.<p>which be the first principles&#8212;Greek, "the rudiments of the beginning of." A Pauline phrase (see on [2552]Ga 4:3; [2553]Ga 4:9). Ye need not only to be taught the first elements, but also "which they be." They are therefore enumerated Heb 6:1, 2 [Bengel]. Alford translates, "That someone teach you the rudiments"; but the position of the Greek, "tina," inclines me to take it interrogatively, "which," as English Version, Syriac, Vulgate, &c.<p>of the oracles of God&#8212;namely, of the Old Testament: instead of seeing Christ as the end of the Old Testament Scripture, they were relapsing towards Judaism, so as not only not to be capable of understanding the typical reference to Christ of such an Old Testament personage as Melchisedec, but even much more elementary references.<p>are become&#8212;through indolence.<p>milk &#8230; not &#8230; strong meat&#8212;"Milk" refers to such fundamental first principles as he enumerates in Heb 6:1, 2. The solid meat, or food, is not absolutely necessary for preserving life, but is so for acquiring greater strength. Especially in the case of the Hebrews, who were much given to allegorical interpretations of their law, which they so much venerated, the application of the Old Testament types, to Christ and His High Priesthood, was calculated much to strengthen them in the Christian faith [Limborch].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For when for the time ye ought to be teachers:</span> the conviction of this fault in their understanding and will, is by the Spirit demonstrated; for their dulness proceeded from their neglect of God’s means of knowledge, and so was inexcusable; they had time and means enough of improving in the knowledge of this gospel doctrine of Christ’s priesthood, and to have gained in them the abilities of teachers of their families, fellow Christians, and neighbours, both from the law of Moses, and the other Scriptures, and by the teaching of Christ and his apostles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles; </span> yet such was their negligence and idleness, that their knowledge was diminished and lost, and they fallen off to the old Mosaical economy of priesthood, ceremonies and services, so as they had need again to be taught and instructed by others which are the stoiceia of God’s oracles in the Scriptures, such things as are the first in order, and first to be taught and learnt, the very fundamental principles of Christianity, without the knowledge of which none can be saved, and on which all others do depend.

These Hebrews had had great advantages; they were not only descended from Abraham, and had the law of Moses, and the writings of the Old Testament, but some of them had enjoyed the ministry of Christ, and however of his apostles; and it was now about thirty years from the day of Pentecost, in which the gifts of the Holy Ghost were bestowed in such an extraordinary manner, and a large number were converted, and a church state settled among them; and therefore considering the length of time, the opportunities and advantages they had enjoyed, it might have been expected, and indeed it is what should have been, that they would have been teachers of others, some in a private, and some in a public way: from whence it may be observed, that to have time for learning, and yet make no proficiency, is an aggravation of dulness; moreover, that men ought to be hearers, and make some good proficiency in hearing, before they are fit to be teachers of others; also, that persons are not only to hear for their own edification, but for the instruction of others, though all hearers are not designed for public teachers; for to be teachers of others, requires a considerable share of knowledge: to which may be added, that the churches of Christ are the proper seminaries of Gospel ministers. But this was so far from being the case of these Hebrews, that the apostle says of them, <p>ye have need that one teach on again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; by the oracles of God are meant the Scriptures, not the law of Moses only, but all the writings of the Old Testament, which were given by the respiration of God, and are authoritative and infallible; and by the "first principles" of them are intended, either the first promises in them, concerning the Messiah; or the institutions, rites, and ceremonies of the law, which are sometimes called  elements, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a> where the same word is used as here; and which were the alphabet and rudiments of the Gospel to the Jews: or else the apostle designs the plain doctrines of the Gospel, which were at first preached unto them, in which they needed to be again instructed, as they were at first; so that instead of going forward, they had rather gone back: <p>and are become such as have need of milk; of the types, shadows, and figures of the law, which were suited to the infant state of the church, who by sensible objects were directed to the view of Gospel grace; or of the plain and easier parts of the Gospel, comparable to milk for their purity, sweetness, nourishing nature, and being easy of digestion: <p>and not of strong meat: such as the deep things of God, the mysteries of the Gospel; those which are more hard to he understood, received, and digested; such as the doctrines of the Trinity, of God's everlasting love, of eternal election and reprobation, of the person of Christ, the abrogation of the law, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which <i>be</i> the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</span><p>(7) An example of an apostolic exhortation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>.

The word is taken as an <span class="ital">interrogative particle</span> by the Peshito and Vulgate, Augustine, <span class="ital">Tract</span>. 98 <span class="ital">in Joh</span>.; Schlichting, Grotius, Owen, Wolf, Bengel, Abresch, Schulz, Kuinoel, Klee, de Wette, Tischendorf, Stengel, Bloomfield, Conybeare, Delitzsch, Riehm, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 780; Reuss, Maier, Moll, Kurtz, Ewald, Hofmann, and the majority. As an <span class="ital">indefinite pronoun</span>, on the other hand, it is taken by Oecumenius, Luther, Calvin, Peirce, Cramer, Heinrichs, Böhme, Lachmann, Stuart, Bleek, Ebrard, Bisping, Alford, Woerner, and others. The latter alone grammatically possible. For in the opposite case, since the subject is a varying one in the <span class="ital">tempus finitum</span> (<span class="greekheb">χρείαν ἔχετε</span>) and the <span class="ital">infinitive</span> (<span class="greekheb">διδάσκειν</span>), either the infinitive passive must be written, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ διδάσκεσθαι ὑμᾶς</span>, or to the infinitive active a special accusative of the subject (perhaps <span class="greekheb">ἐμέ</span>) must be further added. Nor is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a> decisive in opposition hereto, since there the reading of Lachmann: <span class="greekheb">οὐ χρείαν ἔχομεν γράφειν ὑμῖν</span>, is the only correct one. See, besides, the remarks in my <span class="ital">Commentary on the Thessalonians, ad loc</span>. [E. T. p. 118 f.]. As, moreover, in a grammatical respect, so also in a logical respect is the accentuation <span class="greekheb">τίνα</span> to be rejected. For upon the adopting thereof the thought would arise, that the readers anew required instruction upon the question: <span class="ital">which articles are to be reckoned among the</span> <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα τῆς ἀρχῆς τῶν λογίων τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, or else: <span class="ital">of what nature these are</span>. But manifestly the author is only complaining—as is plain also from the explicative clause: <span class="greekheb">καὶ γεγόνατε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.—of the fact that the readers, who ought long ago to have been qualified for instructing others, themselves still needed to be instructed in the <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα</span>. While, for the rest, de Wette and Riehm erroneously find in the indefinite <span class="greekheb">τινά</span> “too strong a signification,” Delitzsch is equally mistaken in characterizing it as “unmeaning” and “flat.” With justice does Alford remark, in opposition to the last-named: “So far from <span class="greekheb">τινά</span>, <span class="ital">some one</span>, being, as Delitzsch most absurdly says, ‘matt und nichtssagend,’ it carries with it the fine keen edge of reproach; <span class="ital">q. d.</span> to teach you what all know, and any can teach.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>] preposed to the <span class="greekheb">τινά</span>, in order to bring into the more marked relief the antithesis to <span class="greekheb">εἶναι διδάσκαλοι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The notion of <span class="ital">rudimenta</span> already existing in <span class="greekheb">τὰ στοιχεῖα</span> is made yet more definitely prominent by the genitive <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἀρχῆς</span> (Calvin: “quo plus incutiat pudoris”).

Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1829, H. 2, p. 338), Ebrard, and others, in proof that the Epistle to the Hebrews cannot have been addressed to the Palestinean congregations, particularly not to the congregation at Jerusalem. The tenor of the verse might, it is true, appear strange, considering that the congregation at Jerusalem was the parent congregation of all the others, and out of its midst had proceeded the most distinguished teachers of Christianity. Nevertheless this last fact is not at all called in question by the statement of the verse. For the author has present to his mind the condition of the congregation as it was in his own time; he is addressing—in favour of which also <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸν χρόνον</span> pronounces—a second generation of Palestinean Christianity. The narrow-minded tendency, however, which this second generation had assumed, instead of advancing in its growth to the recognition of the freedom and universality of Christianity as the most perfect religion, might well justify with regard to it the utterance of a reproach such as we here meet with. Only thus much follows from the words,—what is also confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm" title="Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.">Hebrews 13:7</a>,—that when the author wrote, James the Lord’s brother had already been torn from the congregation at Jerusalem by death, since he would otherwise certainly have written in another tone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ ὀφείλοντες</span>.… “For indeed, though in consideration of the time [since you received Christ] ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the beginning [the elements] of the oracles of God.”—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸν χρόνον</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32</a>; how long they had professed Christianity we do not know, but quite possibly for twenty or thirty years.

This advance was their duty, <span class="greekheb">ὀφείλοντες</span>. Instead of thus accumulating Christian knowledge, they had let slip even the rudiments, so far at any rate as to allow them to fall into the background of their mind and to become inoperative. Their primal need of instruction had recurred. The need had again arisen, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ διδάσκειν ὑμᾶς τινὰ</span> “of some one teaching you,” the genitive following <span class="greekheb">χρείαν</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm" title="For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.">Hebrews 10:36</a>.

Here, then, “the beginning of the oracles of God” would mean the oracles of God as taught in the beginning of one’s education by these oracles. This of itself is a strong enough expression, but to make it stronger <span class="greekheb">τὰ στοιχεῖα</span> is added, as if he said “the rudiments of the rudiments,” the A B C of the elements. <span class="greekheb">τῶν λογίων τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span>, “oraculorum Dei, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, Evangelii, in quo maxima et summe necessaria sunt Dei oracula, quae et sic dicuntur, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.

Abundant illustrations from Greek literature in Wetstein. Instead of becoming adults, able to stand on their own feet, select and digest their own food, they had fallen into spiritual dotage, had entered a second childhood, and could only receive the simplest nourishment. Milk represents traditional teaching, that which has been received and digested by others, and is suitable for those who have no teeth of their own and no sufficiently strong powers of digestion. This teaching is admirably adapted to the first stage of Christian life, but it cannot form mature Christians.

The articles of the Old Testament are to the perfection of the doctrines of the New Testament, as letters are to further learning.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("oracles"), is used elsewhere for the revelations of the Old Testament, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>. Here its meaning can hardly be taken as confined to them, since the first principles of the gospel are being spoken cf. Still, a word that includes them in its meaning may be purposely used by way of intimating that the elements intended are those of Judaism as well as Christianity, or of the latter only in its first emergence out of Judaism. And accordingly, vers. 1, 2 of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, where they are enumerated, are (as will be seen) so worded as to imply no more than this; nor are the first principles there mentioned beyond what an enlightened Jew might be expected to understand readily. Be it observed that the Hebrew Church need not be supposed to have actually lost sight of these first principles, so as to require a new indoctrination into them. There may be a vein of delicate irony in what is said, after the manner of St. Paul. All that is of necessity implied is that there had been such a failure in seeing what these principles led to as to suggest the necessity of their being learnt anew. The writer does not, in fact, as he goes on, require them to be learnt anew; for he bids his readers leave them behind, as though already known, and proceed from them to perfection, though still with some misgiving as to their capability for doing so. The figure of milk for babes and solid food for full-grown men, to illustrate the teaching suitable for neophytes and for advanced Christians, is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1, 2</a>; and that of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>.
