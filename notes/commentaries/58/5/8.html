It was no singular thing for a son, or child of God by adoption, to be chastised, to suffer, and thereby to be instructed to obedience. He therefore speaks not of him as a son in such a way, or in any way in which a mere creature might be God’s son, but as he was his Son in a peculiar sense, his only-begotten Son, who was in the beginning with God, and was God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> : that <span class="ital">He </span>should do and suffer the things here spoken of, was indeed marvellous. Therefore it is said, he did and suffered them <span class="ital">although he was a Son. </span>Which words imply both the necessity of his doing and suffering what is here ascribed to him, and his love, that when, on his own account no such thing was required, or in any respect needful, yet that he would submit to this condition for our sakes. But what is the <span class="ital">obedience </span>here intended? To this it may be answered, the word <span class="greekheb">υπακοη</span>, so rendered, means an obediential attendance to, or compliance with, the commands of another, when they are <span class="ital">heard, </span>and thereby <span class="ital">known. </span>This obedience in Christ was two-fold: 1st, General, in the whole course of his life. Every thing he did was not only right and holy as to the matter of it, but as to the form and manner of it; it was obediential: he did all things, because it was the will of God that he should do them; and this his obedience to God was the life and beauty of the holiness, even of Christ himself. This, however, is not chiefly meant here, but rather, 2d, That peculiar compliance with the Father’s will, whereby he became <span class="ital">obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. </span>For this commandment had he received of the Father, that he should lay down his life for his people, and which he did in the way of obedience, saying, <span class="ital">A body hast thou prepared me; lo! I come to do thy will, </span>by offering up that body, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-9.htm" title="Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.">Hebrews 10:9</a>. But how did he <span class="ital">learn </span>this obedience? It must be observed, 1st, The word <span class="greekheb">μανθανω</span>, here used, signifies <span class="ital">to learn </span>as a disciple, with an humble, willing subjection to, and a ready reception of, the instruction given. 2d, It is said he learned <span class="ital">obedience, </span>not he learned to obey, which will give us light in the meaning of the passage. He did not learn that to be his duty which he knew not before, or did not consider; nor was he impelled to, or instructed, or directed in the various acts of the obedience required, as we are often taught by chastisements. But, 3d, He learned obedience by experiencing it, as a man learns the taste of meat by eating it. Thus he was said <span class="ital">to taste of death, </span>or to experience what was in it by undergoing it. The obedience he learned was a submission to undergo great, hard, and terrible things, accompanied with patience under them, and faith for deliverance from them. This he could have no experience of but by suffering the things he was to undergo, and by the exercise of appropriate graces while suffering. Thus he learned or experienced in himself, what difficulty obedience is attended with. And, 4th, This way of his learning it is what is so useful to us, and so full of consolation. For if he had only known obedience, though never so perfectly, in theory merely, what relief could have accrued to us from it? How could it have been a spring in him of suitable compassion toward us? But now, having fully experienced the nature of that special obedience which is yielded to God in a suffering condition, what difficulty it is attended with, what opposition is made to it, how great an exercise of grace is required, &c., he is disposed to support and succour us in this our obedience and sufferings.

This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of that number?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though he were a Son - Though the Son of God. Though he sustained this exalted rank, and was conscious of it, yet he was willing to learn experimentally what is meant by obedience in the midst of sufferings.<p>Yet learned he obedience - That is, he learned experimentally and practically. It cannot be supposed that he did not "know" what obedience was; or that he was "indisposed" to obey God before he suffered; or that he had, as we have, perversities of nature leading to rebellion which required to be subdued by suffering, but that he was willing to "test" the power of obedience in sufferings; to become personally and practically acquainted with the nature of such obedience in the midst of protracted woes; compare note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>. The "object" here is, to show how well suited the Lord Jesus was to be a Saviour for mankind; and the argument is, that he has set us an example, and has shown that the most perfect obedience may be manifested in the deepest sorrows of the body and the soul. Hence, learn that one of the objects of affliction is to lead us "to obey God." In prosperity we forget it. We become self-confident and rebellious. "Then" God lays his hand upon us; breaks up our plans; crushes our hopes; takes away our health, and teaches us that we "must" be submissive to his will. Some of the most valuable lessons of obedience are learned in the furnace of affliction; and many of the most submissive children of the Almighty have been made so as the result of protracted woes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Though He WAS (so it ought to be translated: a positive admitted fact: not a mere supposition as were would imply) God's divine Son (whence, even in His agony, He so lovingly and often cried, Father, Mt 26:39), yet He learned His (so the Greek) obedience, not from His Sonship, but from His sufferings. As the Son, He was always obedient to the Father's will; but the special obedience needed to qualify Him as our High Priest, He learned experimentally in practical suffering. Compare Php 2:6-8, "equal with God, but &#8230; took upon Him the form of a servant, and became obedient unto death," &c. He was obedient already before His passion, but He stooped to a still more humiliating and trying form of obedience then. The Greek adage is, "Pathemata mathemata," "sufferings, disciplinings." Praying and obeying, as in Christ's case, ought to go hand in hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He fulfilled his type in the end; for though he were God the Son incarnate, in a nearer and more excellent relation to the Father than any angel, or any high priest among men his types, being all servants to his Father and him; God’s Son by eternal generation as to his Deity, by conception from the Holy Ghost by the virgin as to his humanity, who for his worth might have been exempted from such burdens; yet did God teach him (not as if he wanted it at any time) by what he imposed and commanded him, and he learnt by what he did agree and covenant to perform, active obedience to God’s will, fulfilling all righteousness, being for his person, and doing for his work to a tittle what God required from him; but especially passive obedience, by his experience knowing what it meant, freely subjecting himself to his state of humiliation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:...">Philippians 2:6-8</a></span>, enduring all the indignities and sufferings for sinners from his birth to his death, even the most vile and cursed.

The Son of God, as the Vulgate Latin version reads; not by creation, nor by adoption, nor by office, but by nature, being the only begotten of the Father, having the same nature and perfections with him: <p>yet learned he obedience; not to his parents, or civil magistrates, though that is true; nor merely to the precepts of the law, which he did; but unto death: through sufferings he became obedient to death, even the death of the cross: and this he learnt; not that he was ignorant of the nature of it; nor was he destitute of an obedient disposition to it; but the meaning is, he had an experience of it, and effected it; and which was voluntary, and done in our room and stead; and is the rule and the measure of our righteousness before God: and this he learned, <p>by the things which he suffered; from men, from devils, and from the justice of God. Christ's sonship did not exempt him from obedience and sufferings; this shows the dignity of Christ's person, that he is the Son of God, not as Mediator, for as such he is a servant; and it would be no wonder that he should learn obedience as a servant; and this shows also the great humility and condescension of Christ in obeying and suffering for us; though so great a person; and likewise the vile nature of sin, and the strictness of divine justice: and we may learn from hence, not to expect to be exempted from sufferings on account of sonship; nor to conclude we are not sons, because we suffer; and that afflictions are instructive, and by them experience is learned. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Though he were a Son, yet <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</span><p>(i) He learned in deed what it is to have a Father, whom a man must obey.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καίπερ ὢν υἱός</span>] belongs together. With Heinrichs and others, to construe <span class="greekheb">καίπερ</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἔμαθεν</span>, and in this way to enclose <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a> within a parenthesis, is forbidden by the grammar, since <span class="greekheb">καίπερ</span> is never combined with a tempus finitum. <span class="greekheb">καίπερ ὢν υἱός</span>, however, is to be connected neither, by virtue of an hyperbaton, with <span class="greekheb">δεήσεις</span> … <span class="greekheb">προσενέγκας</span>, which Photius (in Oecumenius) and Clarius consider permissible, but which is already shown to be impossible by means of the addition <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰσακουσθεὶς ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλαβείας</span>, nor yet with <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰσακουσθεὶς ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλαβείας</span> itself (Chrysostom, Theophylact). For against <span class="ital">the latter</span> <span class="greekheb">καίπερ</span> is decisive, according to which the property of Sonship is insisted on as something in consequence of which the main statement might appear strange; it is not, however, strange, but, on the contrary, congruent with nature, if any one is heard by the Father on account of his sonship. <span class="greekheb">καίπερ ὢν υἱός</span> belongs, therefore, to <span class="greekheb">ἔμαθεν ἀφʼ ὧν ἔπαθεν τὴν ὑπακοήν</span>, and serves to bring the same into relief by way of contrast. Notwithstanding the fact that Christ was a Son, He learned from suffering (learned, in that He suffered) obedience, resignation to the will of the Father. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:...">Php 2:6-8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The article before <span class="greekheb">ὑπακοήν</span> marks <span class="ital">the definite virtue</span> of obedience. The article here cannot denote, as Hofmann will maintain (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 72, 2 Aufl.), the obedience “already present,” or the obedience “in which Jesus stood.” For, on the one hand, there must then have been previous mention of the obedience of Jesus, which is not the case; and then, on the other hand, we cannot any longer predicate the <span class="ital">learning</span> of a virtue of one in whom this virtue is already present. But altogether, that which Hofmann brings out as the import of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a> is a wonderful Quid pro quo. Instead of recognising, to wit, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;...">Hebrews 5:7-8</a> the sharply and clearly defined leading statement: <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἐν ταῖς ὃ μέραις τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἔμαθεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">τὴν ὑπακοήν</span> in itself, and in its simply confirmatory relation to <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἑαυτὸν ἐδόξασεν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-5.htm" title="So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you.">Hebrews 5:5</a>, Hofmann will have the stress to be laid upon the subsidiary defining note <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ὧν ἔπαθεν</span>, and then, moreover, make the whole weight of the words: <span class="greekheb">καίπερ ὢν υἱός</span>, fall upon that same <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ὧν ἔπαθεν</span>! In this way the thought expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a> is, forsooth: that Jesus afterwards (!) suffered that (!) for the averting of which He had made entreaty. The special point is not that He learnt anything as Son, nor that He learnt obedience (?!). He did not learn to obey, but the obedience in which He stood, He now (!) or in a new manner (!) <span class="ital">so</span> learnt, as it should there (!) be exercised, where (!) it was a question (!) of suffering. And this is to be taken as the meaning, in spite of the fact—apart from all other arbitrary assumptions—that we have <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ὧν ἔπαθεν</span> written, and not even <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἷς ἔπαθεν</span>, which at least must be expected as a support for such an exposition as that?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔμαθεν</span>] The <span class="ital">disposition</span> of obedience Christ possessed even before the suffering. But this needed, in order to become vouched for, to be tested in action. And this continued development of the disposition of obedience into the act of obedience is nothing else than a practical learning of the virtue of obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> with <span class="greekheb">μανθάνειν</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm" title="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:">Matthew 24:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm" title="Take my yoke on you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.">Matthew 11:29</a>, denoting the starting-point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ὧν ἔπαθεν</span>] well-known attraction in place of <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἐκείνων ἅ ἔπαθεν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The combination <span class="greekheb">ἔμαθεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἔπαθεν</span> is also of frequent occurrence with the classic writers and with Philo.

The result of his being heard was therefore that he suffered, but in the suffering He learned obedience, perfect unison with the will of God for the salvation of men so that He became a perfected Priest. He learned obedience <span class="greekheb">καίπερ ὢν υἱός</span>: “this is stated to obviate the very idea of assumption on his part” (Davidson). Perhaps, therefore, we should translate, with a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-5.htm" title="So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you.">Hebrews 5:5</a>, “although He was Son”. Although Son and therefore possessed of Divine love and in sympathy with the Divine purpose, He had yet to learn that perfect submission which is only acquired by obeying in painful, terrifying circumstances. He made deeper and deeper experience of what obedience is and costs. And <span class="ital">the particular obedience</span> [<span class="greekheb">τὴν ὑπακ</span>.] which was required of Him in the days of His flesh was that which at once gave Him perfect entrance into the Divine love and human need. It is when the child is told to do something which pains him, and which he shrinks from, that he learns obedience, learns to submit to another will. And the things which Christ suffered in obeying God’s will taught Him perfect submission and at the same time perfect devotedness to man. On this obedience, see Robertson Smith in <span class="ital">Expositor</span> for 1881, p. 424. <span class="greekheb">καίπερ</span> is often joined with the participle to emphasise its concessive use [see Burton, 437], as in Diod. Sic., iii. 17, <span class="greekheb">οὗτος ὁ βίος καίπερ ὢν παράδοξος</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔμαθεν ἀφʼ ὧν ἔπαθε</span>, a common form of attraction and also a common proverbial saying, of which Wetstein gives a number of instances; Herodot. i. 207; Æsch., <span class="ital">Agam.</span>, 177, <span class="greekheb">πάθει μάθος</span>, Demosth., 1232 <span class="greekheb">τοὺς μετὰ τὸ παθεῖν μανθάνοντας</span>.

The stress is not on His “<span class="ital">learning</span>” (of course <span class="ital">as a man</span>), but the whole expression is taken together, “He learnt from the things which He suffered,” in other words “He bowed to the experience of absolute submission.” “The things which He suffered” refer not only to the Agony and the Cross, but to the whole of the Saviour’s life. Some of the Fathers stumbled at this expression. Theodoret calls it hyperbolical; St Chrysostom is surprised at it; Theophylact goes so far as to say that here Paul (for he accepts the traditional authorship) “for the benefit of his hearers used such accommodation as obviously to say some unreasonable things.” All such remarks would have been obviated if these fathers had borne in mind that, as St Paul says, Christ “counted not equality with God a thing at which to grasp” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a>). Meanwhile passages like these, of which there are several in this Epistle, are valuable as proving how completely the co-equal and co-eternal Son “emptied Himself of His glory.” Against the irreverent reverence of the Apollinarian heresy (which denied Christ’s perfect manhood) and the Monothelite heresy (which denied His possession of a human will), this passage, and the earlier chapters of St Luke are the best bulwark. The human soul of Christ’s perfect manhood “learned” just as His human body grew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>). On this learning of “obedience” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-5.htm" title="The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.">Isaiah 50:5</a>, “I was not rebellious.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Php 2:8</a>, “Being found in fashion as a man he became obedient unto death.” The paronomasia “he learnt [<span class="ital">emathen</span>) from what He <span class="ital">suffered</span> (<span class="ital">epathen</span>)” is one of the commonest in Greek literature.

In His agony in Geth-semane He so sweetly, so frequently, appealed to the <span class="ital">Father</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>, etc.: and from this fact we have the clearest confirmation of the truth that Jesus was not the Son of God merely because He rose from the dead, and not previously.—<span class="greekheb">ἔμαθεν</span>, <span class="ital">He learned</span>) The word <span class="ital">learning</span> put before the word <span class="ital">suffering</span>, elegantly points to Christ <span class="ital">learning</span> with the utmost readiness and willingness. <span class="ital">He learned</span> obedience whilst He began to suffer, whilst He set Himself to drink the cup. The word <span class="ital">to learn</span> implies a kind of <span class="ital">beginning</span>, and the <span class="ital">making perfect</span> corresponds to this <span class="ital">beginning</span>, of which we shall afterwards speak. There is a pleasant paronomasia[31] in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΜΑΘΕΝ ἈΦʼ ὯΝ ἜΠΑΘΕ</span></span></span>. He also had experience of the adage, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΘΉΜΑΤΑ ΜΑΘΉΜΑΤΑ</span></span></span> [sufferings, the means of learning]. Christ alone fortified [secured] the path of obedience in a way consonant to the will of the Father. <span class="ital">Obedience</span> may be performed without <span class="ital">prayers</span>.[32]—<span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ών</span>) So <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΑΘΕῖΝ ἈΠῸ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm" title="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:">Matthew 24:32</a>.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῊΝ ὙΠΑΚΟῊΝ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">obedience</span>) That kind of humble obedience which is shown in suffering and dying. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Php 2:8</a>, note. He says to the Father, <span class="ital">as Thou wilt</span>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰσακουσθεὶς</span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΑΚΟΉΝ</span></span></span>, are conjugates. The Father <span class="ital">hearkened</span> to the Son, and the Son to the Father. In like manner Christ <span class="ital">obeyed</span> the Father;[33] we <span class="ital">obey</span> Christ; see the following verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[31] See Append.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[32] But Christ joined both <span class="ital">prayers</span> and <span class="ital">obedience:</span> and this is the Father’s will.—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[33] Equivalent to hearkened to, so as to obey, <span class="ital">obedio</span>, Th. <span class="ital">ob audio</span>.—ED.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Though he were a Son (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3c9;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>For were rend. was. His training for the priesthood involved suffering, even though he was a son. Connect with &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; learned, not with the preceding clause, which would mean that his position as a son did not exempt him from the obligation to godly fear, which is true as a fact (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>), but is not the point of emphasis here.<p>Learned he obedience (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>Omit he, since the subject of &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; learned is &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2; who, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>. Jesus did not have to learn to obey, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>; but he required the special discipline of a severe human experience as a training for his office as a high priest who could be touched with the feeling of human infirmities. He did not need to be disciplined out of any inclination to disobedience; but, as Alford puts it, "the special course of submission by which he became perfected as our high priest was gone through in time, and was a matter of acquirement and practice." This is no more strange than his growth in wisdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>. Growth in experience was an essential part of his humanity.<p>By the things which he suffered (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;' &#x3c9;&#788;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Or from the things, etc. Note the word-play, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;. So Croesus, addressing Cyrus, says, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, "my sufferings, though painful, have proved to be lessons" (Hdt. i.:207): so Soph. Trach. 142, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;' &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; "mayst thou not learn by suffering." </body></html>
