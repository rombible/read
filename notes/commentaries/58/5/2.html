The apostle’s words imply that a high-priest, who is not touched with a feeling of the weaknesses and miseries of others, is unfit to officiate for them, because he will be apt to neglect them in his ministrations, or be thought by the people in danger of so doing. <span class="ital">On the ignorant </span>— Who, not being properly instructed in divine things, are involved in error with respect to them; <span class="ital">and on them that are out of the way </span>— Of truth and duty, of wisdom, holiness, and happiness; or who, through their ignorance or any other cause, fall into sin: so that all sins and sinners are here comprehended. <span class="ital">For that he himself is compassed with infirmity </span>— So that under a consciousness thereof, he will officiate for them with the greater kindness and assiduity, knowing that he needs the compassion which he shows to others. <span class="ital">And by reason hereof </span>— Because he himself is a sinner; <span class="ital">he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, </span>(see the margin,) <span class="ital">to offer for sins </span>— That, being pardoned himself, and in a state of reconciliation and peace with God, he may offer for others with more acceptance.

This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of that number?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who can have compassion - Margin, "Reasonably bear with." The idea is that of "sympathizing with." The high priest is taken from among men, in order that he may have a fellow-feeling for those on whose behalf he officiates. Sensible of his own ignorance, he is able to sympathize with those who are ignorant; and compassed about with infirmity, he is able to succour those who have like infirmities.<p>And on them that are out of the way - The erring, and the guilty.

He is liable to err; He is subject to temptation; he must die, and appear before God - and encompassed with these infirmities, he is better qualified to minister in behalf of guilty and dying people. For the same reason it is, that the ministers of the gospel are chosen from among people. They are of like passions with others. They are sinners; they are dying men. They can enter into the feelings of those who are conscious of guilt; they can sympathize with those who tremble in dread of death; they can partake of the emotions of those who expect soon to appear before God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xii. 3, 2) remarks upon the striking self-restraint and moderation (<span class="greekheb">μετριοπαθησάντων</span>) of Vespasian and Titus towards the Jews notwithstanding their many conflicts.] If the priest is cordially to plead with God for the sinner, he must bridle his natural disgust at the loathsomeness of sensuality, his impatience at the frequently recurring fall, his hopeless alienation from the hypocrite and the superficial, his indignation at any confession he hears from the penitent. This self-repression he must exercise <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀγνοοῦσι καὶ πλανωμένοις</span>: “the ignorant and erring”.

The priests, living for the greater part of the year in their own homes, were known to have their weaknesses like other men, and even the high priests were not exempt from the common passions.

The Stoics held that these should be absolutely crushed and that “apathy” (<span class="greekheb">ἀπάθεια</span>) was the only fit condition for a Philosopher. The Peripatetics on the other hand—the school of Aristotle—held that the philosopher should not aim at apathy, because no man can be absolutely passionless without doing extreme violence to nature; but that he should acquire <span class="ital">metriopathy</span> that is a spirit of “moderated emotion” and self-control. The word is found both in Philo and Josephus. In common usage it meant “moderate <span class="ital">compassion</span>;” since the Stoics held “pity” to be not only a weakness but a vice. The Stoic <span class="ital">apatheia</span> would have utterly disqualified any one for true Priesthood.

Laert. says of Aristotle, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>. In this sense Philo uses <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> to express Abraham's sober grief after the death of Sarah (2:37) and Jacob's patience under his afflictions (2:45). The verb, followed, as here, by a dative of persons, may be taken, therefore, to denote moderation of feeling towards the persons indicated, such moderation being especially opposed in the case before us, where the persons are the ignorant and erring, to excess of severe or indignant feeling. Moderation, indeed, in this regard seems to have been the idea generally attached to the compound (cf. Plut., 'De Ira Cohib.' p. 453, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Josephus also speaks of the emperors Vespasian and Titus as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in their attitude towards the Jews after long hostility ('Ant.,' 12:3 2). This, then, being the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it is obvious how the capacity of it is essential to the idea of a high priest as being one who is resorted to as a mediator by a people laden with infirmities, to represent them and to plead for them. It is not of necessity implied that every high priest was personally <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: it is the ideal of his office that is spoken cf. And, in the case of human high priests, this ideal was fulfilled by their being themselves human, encompassed themselves with the infirmity of those for whom they mediated. Christ also, so far, evidently fulfils the condition. For, though he is afterwards distinguished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a>) from priests having themselves infirmity, yet he had, in his human nature, experienced what it was: "He was crucified <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>); "Himself took our infirmities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), and bare our sicknesses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>); the agony in the garden (whatever its mysterious import, of which more below)expressed personal experience of human <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Alford denies that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense supposed by him to be here intended, can be attributed to Christ, and hence that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> can apply to him (but see above on Hebrews 4:15, and below on vers. 3, 7). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Have compassion (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>N.T.o. olxx. oClass. Originally of the rational regulation of the natural passions, as opposed to the Stoic &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, which involved the crushing out of the passions.

Here it denotes a state of feeling toward the ignorant and erring which is neither too severe nor too tolerant. The high priest must not be betrayed into irritation at sin and ignorance, neither must he be weakly indulgent.<p>The ignorant (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;)<p>Comp. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; ignorances, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-31</a>, where the distinction is drawn between sins of ignorance and sins of presumption. Atonement for sins of ignorance was required by the Levitical law as a means of educating the moral perception, and of showing that sin and defilement might exist unsuspected: that God saw evil where men did not, and that his test of purity was stricter than theirs.<p>For that he himself also is compassed with infirmity (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Sympathy belongs to the high-priestly office, and grows out of the sense of personal infirmity.
