This verse and the next correspond to the general thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1-2</a>, so far as it is applicable to “Him who knew no sin.”<p>The following rendering will, it is believed, best show the meaning of these two important verses, and the connection of the several parts: <span class= "ital">Who, in the days of His flesh, having with a strong cry and tears offered up prayers and supplications unto Him that was able to save Him out of death, and having been heard for His reverent fear, though He was a son, yet learned obedience by the things which He suffered.</span> The most noticeable change of rendering occurs at the close of the seventh verse; here the interpretation given by all the Greek Fathers, followed in most of our English versions (and in the margin of the Authorised itself), certainly deserves the preference over that which, through the influence of Calvin and Beza, found its way into the Genevan Testament, and hence into the Bishops’ Bible and the translation of 1611. The word rendered “reverent fear” occurs in but one other place in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>); but the kindred verb and adjective are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm" title="By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.">Hebrews 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm" title="And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.">Acts 8:2</a>. It properly denotes, not terror, but a cautious foreseeing fear, opposed alike to rashness and to cowardice: the adjective, which is always rendered “devout,” is fully explained in the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>. No word could be more suitable where the relation of the Son of Man to His “God and Father” is expressed and it would be very difficult to find any other word which should be suitable to this relation and yet contain no implication of sin to be acknowledged with humility and shame. The object of the “prayers and supplications” thus heard and answered is implied in the words “unto Him that was able to save Him <span class= "ital">out of death.”</span> Not “from death:” the Greek words may have that meaning, but it is not their most natural sense, as a comparison of other passages would show. The prayer, we are persuaded, was not that death might be averted, but that there might be granted deliverance out of death. This prayer was answered: His death was the beginning of His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>). It may indeed be asked, Could such a prayer be offered by One who knew “the glory that should follow” His sufferings? In a matter so far beyond our reasoning it is most reverent to point to the mystery of another prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>) offered by Him who had often taught His disciples that He <span class= "ital">must</span> be put to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>). Mark the striking correspondence between the petition thus understood and St. Peter’s quotation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm" title="Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.">Acts 2:24</a>). Some of the expressions in this verse would lead us to believe that the writer’s thought is resting on the Agony in the Garden; but the “strong cry” brings before us the Crucifixion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-50.htm" title="Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.">Matthew 27:50</a>), and the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm" title="My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?">Psalm 22:1</a> lie very near the thought of this verse. It does not seem necessary to decide—we may doubt whether it is possible, and whether both should not be included. The opening words, “in the days of His flesh” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>), would certainly seem to favour this latter view. The word “offered” must not be lightly passed over. Of frequent occurrence in this Epistle, in every case except one (which is not at all in point) it has a sacrificial sense; it seems certain, therefore, that these prayers—a token of His suffering, an example of His reverent fear—are included in the sacrifice which comprised His whole life and death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/hebrews/5.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Hebrews<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">GETHSEMANE</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>WE may take these great and solemn words as a commentary on the gospel narrative of Gethsemane. It is remarkable that there should be here preserved a detail of that agony which is not found in our Gospels. The strong crying and tears find no record in our evangelists, and so it would appear as though the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews was not altogether dependent upon them for his knowledge of Christ’s life. In any case here we have independent witness to the story of Christ’s passion, and a very instructive hint as to the widespread and familiar knowledge of the story of our Lord’s suffering, which existed at the very early date of this Epistle in the churches, so that it could be referred to in this far-off allusive way with the certainty that hearers would distinctly understand what the writer was speaking about. So we get a confirmation of the historical veracity of the narrative that is preserved in our Gospel. But the value of such words as these is their bearing upon far deeper things than that. They point to Gethsemane as showing us Christ, as the companion of our sorrows and supplications, as a pattern of our submissive, devout resignation, and as a lesson for us all how prayer is most truly answered. First, then, take that great thought of my text, the Christ as being our companion in sorrow and in supplication. ‘In the days of His flesh - when He bore what I bear - in the days of His flesh He offered prayer and supplications with strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to save Him from death.’ Now I do not dwell at any length upon the additional contribution to the vividness and solemnity of the picture given us in the detail of the text before us, but I want to refer for one moment, and I will do it as reverently as I can, to the unapproachable narrative, and to make this one remark about it, that all the three evangelists who are our source of knowledge of that scene in the garden of Gethsemane employ strange, and all but unexampled, words in order to express the condition of our Saviour’s spirit then. Matthew, for instance, uses a word which, in our Bible, is translated ‘He began to be very heavy.’ Only once besides, as far as I know, is it employed in scripture, and it seems to mean something like ‘On the very verge of despair.’ And then Mark gives us the same singular expression, adding to it another one which is translated, ‘sore amazed.’ It has been suggested that a more adequate rendering would be ‘began to be appalled,’ and another suggestion has been, that it might be adequately rendered with the phrase ‘that He began to be out of Himself.’ Then comes Luke, with his word, which we have translated into English as ‘agony.’ And then there come Christ’s own strange words, ‘My soul is encompassed with sorrow almost up to the point of death.’ That is not a proverb; I take that to be a literal fact that one more pang and the physical frame would have given way. Now, I do not point to these things in any spirit of curious investigation. I feel, I hope, ‘Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.’ And yet I cannot help feeling that there is a tendency nowadays to say too little about the Gospel story of Christ’s sufferings; it is a reaction, no doubt, and prompted by good motives; it is a reaction from the preaching of a former time, when men used these sacred narratives of our Lord’s last days in the coarsest possible manner, and the climax of it is that horrible kind of preaching that Roman Catholic preachers used to indulge in - Passion sermons. And yet I cannot but feel that we are in danger of going to the other extreme and losing much by not sufficiently dwelling on the facts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then there is another point.. What is the meaning of that-what is the explanation of all the passion, and paroxysm of agony, and fear. and bloody sweat, and horror-stricken appeal? Is it not a very, very unheroic picture that? Is it not strangely unlike the spirit in which many men and women, who drew all courage from Christ, have gone to their death? Is not the servant above his master here, if you will think of a Latimer at the stake, or of many a poor unknown martyr that went to his death as to his bed, and set that side by side with the shrinking of Christ? Well, dear brethren, I know the attempt to explain the flood of sorrow, of dread, and horror of great darkness that wrapt the soul of Jesus Christ in these last moments, on psychological principles, and say it is a pure and lofty end, shrinking from death; but it seems to me the only explanation of it all is the good old one:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘The Lord hath made to meet upon Him the iniquity of us all.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so with the weight of the sins and the sorrows of the world, He began to be sorrowful and very heavy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And then, passing on, let me deal with the matter from another point of view, and remind you that, whatsoever there may be all His own and beyond that reach of common humanity, experienced in the solemn and awful hour, yet it is also the revelation of a companionship that never fails us in all our struggles, tears, and prayers. Oh, how different that makes our passage through the lonely experience of our human life! There are times in every life when all human affection and all human voices fail in the presence of a great sorrow, and when you feel that you must tread this path alone. Although loving hands are stretched out to me through the darkness, and have grasped my own and helped me to stand, yet nothing will still the aching of the solitary heart except the thought of a Christ who has suffered it all already, and who, in the days of His flesh, offered up, with strong crying and tears, His prayer unto Him that was able to save. You remember the old Roman story - grand in its heroic simplicity - of the husband and the wife resolved to escape from the miseries of a tyrant-ridden world by suicide - which to them was less criminal than it is to us - and the wife first of all struck the dagger into her own heart, and drawing it out, embrued with her own blood, hands it to her husband, with the dying words ‘Paetus! it is not painful.’ The sharp edge that strikes into your heart, brethren, has cut into Christ’s first, and the blade tinctured with His blood inflicts only healing wounds upon us. He is our priest because He has gone before us on every road of sorrow and loss, and is ready to sustain us when it comes to our turn to tread it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so turn for a moment to the other conception that is here, viz., that the same solemn scene shows us Christ as being, not only our companion in sorrow and supplication, but our pattern of submissive reverence. The language of my text needs just one word of explanation in order to show where this lies. You observe it reads, ‘And was heard in that He feared.’ Now, these last words, ‘in that He feared,’ have always received two varying expositions, and, I suppose, always will receive them. The text fairly allows one or the other. They may either mean, ‘He was heard or delivered from the thing He dreaded’ - which you know is not true - or they may mean that He was heard by reason of His reverence and submission, or, if we may use such a word - a word that is not Scriptural and very modern - was heard because of His piety. And I suppose the latter was distinctly the meaning in the writer’s mind. Christ’s prayer was, ‘If it be possible,’ and His second prayer was, ‘If this cup may not pass from Me Thy will be done.’ He felt the reluctance of the flesh to enter upon the path of suffering, the perfectly natural human shrinking from all that lay before Him. But that shrinking never made His purpose falter, nor made Him lose His son-like dependence upon the Father’s will and submission to the Father’s will. And so there come out of that, large lessons that I can only just touch for a moment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the first of them is this: let us learn and be thankful for the teaching, that resignation, submission to all the burdens and pains and struggles and sorrows which life brings to us, does not demand the suppression of the natural emotions and affections of the flesh. Christ recoiled from the cup, but Christ’s submission was perfect. And so for us there are two ways. Inclination and duty will often draw us two different ways. Tastes and weaknesses will often suggest one thing, and the high sense of the path we ought to travel upon will suggest another. But the inclination must never be allowed to mount up into the region of the will and to make our purpose falter, or make us abandon that which we feel will be the rough path-Then there will be no sin in the fact that the flesh shrinks, as shrink it must, from the thing which duty demands we should do. Christ, the example of a perfect resignation, is an example of a will that mastered flesh. That is full of encouragement and strength to us in our time of need and conflict.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And then there is the other side of the same thought Not only does there often come into our life the struggle of duty and inclination, but there comes into our life sometimes the other straggle between submission and sorrow. In like manner there is no sin in the tear, there is no sin in the strong crying. It is meet that when His hand is laid heavy upon my heart, my heart should feel the pressure; it is meet that I should take into my consciousness and into my feeling the pain; and then it is meet that if I cannot do anything more - and I don’t think we can - I should at least try through my tears to say, ‘Not my will, but Thine’; and if I cannot do anything more, at least, ‘I was dumb, I opened not my mouth because Thou didst it.’ <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the last point I touch upon is this, that according to the teaching of this commentary upon that solemn scene, our Lord in it sets before us the lesson of what the true answer to prayer is. ‘He prayed unto Him that was able to save Him from death,’ and says my text: ‘He was heard.’ Was He? How was He heard? He was heard in this. There appeared unto Him an angel from heaven strengthening Him. He was heard in this because His prayer was not ‘Let this cup pass,’ but His prayer was, ‘Thy will be done,’ and God’s will was done.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so there comes out the true heart of all true prayer, ‘Thy will be done.’ And the true answer that We get is, not the lifting away of the burden, but the breathing into our hearts strength to bear it, so that it ceases to be a burden. Let us make our prayers not petulant wishes to get our own way, but lowly efforts to enter into God’s way and make His will ours, so shall come to us peace and strength, and a power adequate to Our need. The cup will be sweetened, and our lips made willing to drink it. Christ was heard, and Christ was crucified.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Learn the lesson that if, in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, we make. our requests known unto God, whatsoever other answer may be sent, or not sent, the real and highest answer will surely’ be sent, and the peace of God, which passeth understanding, shall keep our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who, </span>&c. — The sum of the things treated of in the 7th and following chapters, is contained in this paragraph, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;...">Hebrews 5:7-10</a>, and in this sum is admirably comprised the process of his passion with its inmost causes, in the very terms used by the evangelists. <span class="ital">Who in the days of his flesh </span>— Those two days in particular wherein his sufferings were at the height; <span class="ital">when he had offered up prayers and supplications </span>thrice; <span class="ital">with strong crying and tears </span>— In the garden; <span class="ital">to him </span>(his heavenly Father) <span class="ital">that was able to save him from death </span>— Which yet he endured in obedience to his Father’s will. The reader will easily understand what is here said concerning the <span class="ital">fear </span>and sorrow, the <span class="ital">strong crying and tears </span>of the Son of God, if he remember that He, who was perfect God, and possessed of all possible perfections as the eternal Word of the Father, was also perfect man, “of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting:” in other words, that in his mysterious person, the perfect human nature, consisting of soul and body, was indeed united indissolubly to the divine, but was not while he was on earth, (and is not even now,) absorbed by it. The union was such as gave an infinite dignity to the person of the Redeemer, and infinite merit to his sufferings, but not such as made him incapable of suffering, or rendered his sufferings of no efficacy, which would have been the case if they had not been felt. Only let this be kept in remembrance, and Christ’s humiliation and sorrow will not be a stone of stumbling to us, or rock of offence, any more than his exaltation and glory. <span class="ital">And was heard in that he feared </span>— To be heard, signifies, in Scripture, <span class="ital">to be accepted in our requests, </span>or to be <span class="ital">answered in them. </span>There is no doubt but the Father heard the Son always in the former sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm" title="And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.">John 11:42</a> : but how far was he heard in the latter, so as to be delivered from what he prayed against? In answer to this it must be observed, the prayers of Christ on this occasion were, 1st, Conditional; namely, that the cup might pass from him if it were agreeable to his Father’s will; <span class="ital">Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm" title="Saying, Father, if you be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.">Luke 22:42</a>. He could not have been man, and not have had an extreme aversion to the sufferings that were coming upon him in that <span class="ital">hour and power of darkness: </span>when it is certain that Satan and his angels, who had departed from him for a season, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-13.htm" title="And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.">Luke 4:13</a>,) were again permitted to oppress his soul with inexpressible horror. Nothing, in fact, is suffering, or can be penal to us, but what is grievous to our nature. But the mind of Christ, amidst these assaults of hell, and the view given him of the sufferings which awaited him, was so supported and fortified, as to come to a perfect acquiescence in his Father’s will, saying, <span class="ital">Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. </span>But, 2d, His prayers were also <span class="ital">absolute, </span>and were <span class="ital">absolutely heard. </span>He had conceived a deep and dreadful apprehension of death, upon its being presented to him as attended with the wrath and curse of God, due to those sins of mankind, for which he was to make atonement. And he well knew how unable the human nature was to undergo it, (so as to remove that wrath and curse, and make way for the justification of such as should believe in him,) if not mightily supported and carried through the trial by the power of God. And while his faith and trust in God were terribly assaulted by the temptations of Satan suggesting fear, dread, and terrible apprehensions of the divine displeasure due to our sins, it was his duty, and a part of the obedience he owed to his heavenly Father, to pray that he might be supported and delivered, <span class="greekheb">απο της ευλαβειας</span>, <span class="ital">in that he </span>particularly <span class="ital">feared </span>— Or rather; <span class="ital">from his fear, </span>namely, the fear of that weight of infinite justice and wrath, which our sins had provoked; or, <span class="ital">the being bruised and put to grief </span>by the hand of God himself. Compared with this, every thing else was as nothing. And yet so greatly did he thirst to be obedient even unto this dreadful death, and to lay down his life for his sheep, under this dreadful load of anguish and sorrow, that he vehemently longed to be baptized with this baptism, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-50.htm" title="But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!">Luke 12:50</a>. The consideration of its being the will of God that he should thus suffer, first tempered his fear, and afterward swallowed it up. <span class="ital">And </span>he <span class="ital">was heard </span>— Not so that the cup should pass away, but so that he was enabled to drink it without any fear. Thus the prophet represents him as saying, <span class="ital">The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back: I gave my back to the smiters, &c., for the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded; therefore have I set my face like a flint, I know</span> <span class="ital">that I shall not be ashamed, </span>&c, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/50-5.htm" title="The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back....">Isaiah 50:5-8</a>. Add to this, that he was actually delivered from the power of death itself by a glorious resurrection, of which the prophet intimates his having an assured expectation, representing him as adding, <span class="ital">He is near that justifieth me; </span>namely, that acquits me from the charge of being an imposter and blasphemer, by raising me from the dead, exalting me to his own right hand, and investing me with all power in heaven and on earth, and especially by authorizing me to confer the Holy Ghost in his extraordinary gifts upon my disciples, and thereby to give demonstration of my being the true Messiah. In this sense the apostle seems to have understood the passage when he said, that he, who was <span class="ital">put to death in the flesh; </span>namely, as a blasphemer; <span class="ital">was justified in, </span>or by, <span class="ital">the Spirit, </span>conferred by him after his ascension.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The High Priest must be a man, a partaker of our nature. This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of that number?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who - That is, the Lord Jesus - for so the connection demands. The object of this verse and the two following is, to show that the Lord Jesus had that qualification for the office of priest to which he had referred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-2.htm">Hebrews 5:2</a>. It was one important qualification for that office that he who sustained it should be able to show compassion, to aid those that were out of the way, and to sympathize with sufferers; in other words, they were themselves encompassed with infirmity, and thus were able to succour those who were subjected to trials. The apostle shows now that the Lord Jesus had those qualifications, as far as it was possible for one to have them who had no sin. In the days of his flesh he suffered intensely; he prayed with fervor; he placed himself in a situation where he learned subjection and obedience by his trials; and in all this he went far beyond what had been evinced by the priests under the ancient dispensation.<p>In the days of his flesh - When he appeared on earth as a man. Flesh is used to denote human nature, and especially human nature as susceptible of suffering. The Son of God still is united to human nature, but it is human nature glorified, for in his case, as in all others, "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>. He has now a glorified body <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>, such as the redeemed will have in the future world; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-17</a>. The phrase "days of his flesh," means the "time" when he was incarnate, or when he lived on earth in human form. The particular time here referred to, evidently, was the agony in the garden of Gethsemane.<p>Prayers and supplications - These words are often used to denote the same thing. If there is a difference, the former - &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  dee&#772;seis - means petitions which arise "from a sense of need" - from &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  deomai - "to want, to need;" the latter refers usually to supplication "for protection," and is applicable to one who under a sense of guilt flees to an altar with the symbols of supplication in his hand. Suppliants in such cases often carried an olive-branch as an emblem of the peace which they sought. A fact is mentioned by Livy respecting the Locrians that may illustrate this passage. "Ten delegates from the Locrians, squalid and covered with rags, came into the hall where the consuls were sitting, extending the badges of suppliants - olive-branches - according to the custom of the Greeks; and prostrated themselves on the ground before the tribunal, with a lamentable cry;" Lib. xxix. 100:16. The particular idea in the word used here - &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  hikete&#772;ria - is petition for "protection, help," or "shelter" (Passow), and this idea accords well with the design of the passage. The Lord Jesus prayed as one who had "need," and as one who desired "protection, shelter," or "help." The words here, therefore, do not mean the same thing, and are not merely intensive, but they refer to distinct purposes which the Redeemer had in his prayers. He was about to die, and as a man needed the divine help; he was, probably, tempted in that dark hour (see the note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>), and he fled to God for "protection."<p>With strong crying - This word does not mean "weeping," as the word "crying" does familiarly with us. It rather means an outcry, the voice of wailing and lamentation. It is the cry for help of one who is deeply distressed, or in danger; and refers here to the "earnest petition" of the Saviour when in the agony of Gethsemane or when on the cross. It is the "intensity of the voice" which is referred to when it is raised by an agony of suffering; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>, "He prayed more earnestly;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>, "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice - My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" see also <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-50.htm">Matthew 27:50</a>.<p>And tears - Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>, and over Jerusalem; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>. It is not expressly stated by the Evangelists that he "wept" in the garden of Gethsemane, but there is no reason to doubt that he did. In such an intense agony as to cause a bloody sweat, there is every probability that it would be accompanied with tears. We may remark then:<p>(1) That there is nothing "dishonorable" in tears and that man should not be ashamed on proper occasions to weep. The fact that the Son of God wept is a full demonstration that it is not disgraceful to weep. God has so made us as to express sympathy for others by tears. Religion does not make the heart insensible and hard as stoical philosophy does; it makes it tender and susceptible to impression.<p>(2) it is not "improper" to weep. The Son of God wept - and if he poured forth tears it cannot be wrong for us. Besides, it is a great law of our nature that in suffering we should find relief by tears. God would not have so made us if it had been wrong.<p>(3) the fact that the Son of God thus wept should be allowed deeply to effect our hearts.<p>"He wept that we might weep;<p>Each sin demands a tear."<p>He wept that he might redeem us we should weep that our sins were so great as to demand such bitter woes for our salvation. That we had sinned; that our sins caused him such anguish; that he endured for us this bitter conflict, should make us weep. Tear should answer to tear, and sigh respond to sigh, and groan to groan, when we contemplate the sorrows of the Son of God in accomplishing our redemption. That man must have a hard heart who has never had an emotion when he has reflected that the Son of God wept, and bled, and died for him.<p>Unto him that was able - To God. He alone was able then to save. In such a conflict man could not aid, and the help of angels, ready as they were to assist him, could not sustain him. We may derive aid from man in trial; we may be comforted by sympathy and counsel; but there are sorrows where God only can uphold the sufferer. That God was "able" to uphold him in his severe conflict, the Redeemer could not doubt; nor need "we" doubt it in reference to ourselves when deep sorrows come over our souls.<p>To save him from death - It would seem from this, that what constituted the agony of the Redeemer was the dread of death, and that he prayed that he might be saved from that. This might be, so far as the language is concerned, either the dread of death on the spot by the intensity of his sufferings and by the power of the tempter, or it might be the dread of the approaching death on the cross. As the Redeemer, however, knew that he was to die on the cross, it can hardly be supposed that he apprehended death in the garden of Gethsemane. What he prayed for was, that, if it were possible, he might be spared from a death so painful as he apprehended; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>. Feeling that God had "power" to save him from that mode of dying, the burden of his petition was, that, if human redemption could be accomplished without such sufferings, it might please his Father to remove that cup from him.<p>And was heard - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a>, the Saviour says," I know that thou hearest me always." In the garden of Gethsemane, he was heard. His prayer was not disregarded, though it was not" literally" answered. The cup of death was not taken away; but his prayer was not disregarded. What answer was given; what assurance or support was imparted to his soul, we are not informed. The case, however, shows us:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. in the days of his flesh&#8212;(Heb 2:14; 10:20). Heb 5:7-10 state summarily the subject about to be handled more fully in the seventh and eighth chapters.<p>when he had offered&#8212;rather, "in that He offered." His crying and tears were part of the experimental lesson of obedience which He submitted to learn from the Father (when God was qualifying Him for the high priesthood). "Who" is to be construed with "learned obedience" (or rather as Greek, "His obedience"; "the obedience" which we all know about). This all shows that "Christ glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest" (Heb 5:5), but was appointed thereto by the Father.<p>prayers and supplications&#8212;Greek, "both prayers and supplications." In Gethsemane, where He prayed thrice, and on the cross, where He cried, My God, my God &#8230; probably repeating inwardly all the twenty-second Psalm. "Prayers" refer to the mind: "supplications" also to the body (namely, the suppliant attitude) (Mt 26:39) [Bengel].<p>with strong crying and tears&#8212;The "tears" are an additional fact here communicated to us by the inspired apostle, not recorded in the Gospels, though implied. Mt 26:37, "sorrowful and very heavy." Mr 14:33; Lu 22:44, "in an agony He prayed more earnestly &#8230; His sweat &#8230; great drops of blood falling down to the ground." Ps 22:1 ("roaring &#8230; cry"), Ps 22:2, 19, 21, 24; 69:3, 10, "I wept."<p>able to save him from death&#8212;Mr 14:36, "All things are possible unto Thee" (Joh 12:27). His cry showed His entire participation of man's infirmity: His reference of His wish to the will of God, His sinless faith and obedience.<p>heard in that he feared&#8212;There is no intimation in the twenty-second Psalm, or the Gospels that Christ prayed to be saved from the mere act of dying. What He feared was the hiding of the Father's countenance. His holy filial love must rightly have shrunk from this strange and bitterest of trials without the imputation of impatience. To have been passively content at the approach of such a cloud would have been, not faith, but sin. The cup of death He prayed to be freed from was, not corporal, but spiritual death, that is, the (temporary) separation of His human soul from the light of God's countenance. His prayer was "heard" in His Father's strengthening Him so as to hold fast His unwavering faith under the trial (My God, my God, was still His filial cry under it, still claiming God as His, though God hid His face), and soon removing it in answer to His cry during the darkness on the cross, "My God, my God," &c. But see below a further explanation of how He was heard. The Greek literally, is, "Was heard from His fear," that is, so as to be saved from His fear. Compare Ps 22:21, which well accords with this, "Save me from the lion's mouth (His prayer): thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns." Or what better accords with the strict meaning of the Greek noun, "in consequence of His REVERENTIAL FEAR," that is, in that He shrank from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the Father, yet was reverentially cautious by no thought or word of impatience to give way to a shadow of distrust or want of perfect filial love. In the same sense Heb 12:28 uses the noun, and Heb 11:7 the verb. Alford somewhat similarly translates, "By reason of His reverent submission." I prefer "reverent fear." The word in derivation means the cautious handling of some precious, yet delicate vessel, which with ruder handling might easily be broken [Trench]. This fully agrees with Jesus' spirit, "If it be possible &#8230; nevertheless not My will, but Thy will be done"; and with the context, Heb 5:5, "Glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest," implying reverent fear: wherein it appears He had the requisite for the office specified Heb 5:4, "No man taketh this honor unto himself." Alford well says, What is true in the Christian's life, that what we ask from God, though He may not grant in the form we wish, yet He grants in His own, and that a better form, does not hold good in Christ's case; for Christ's real prayer, "not My will, but Thine be done," in consistency with His reverent fear towards the Father, was granted in the very form in which it was expressed, not in another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here Christ is paralleled in his nature, work, and compassions, to his types, and is set above them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who in the days of his flesh:</span> he was taken out of men, as his type was, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1</a></span>.

As to this his Father did hear, answer, and help him; in his agony sent his angel to strengthen him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm" title="And there appeared an angel to him from heaven, strengthening him.">Luke 22:43</a></span>; and which he derfected for him at the end of his passion, when he breathed out his soul triumphantly into his Father’s hands, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>,50 Mr 15:37,39 Joh 19:28-30</span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. From the fear, that godly fear and care in him not to displease God in any thing he did or suffered; this was a proper cause of his acceptance, and his prayer being heard, and his deliverance, which is becoming the Mediator. This is a truth, and may be admitted; but it seemeth especially to refer to the former by his prevalency, against which by prayer he defeated the devil, was made feelingly sensible of his temptations, showed himself compassed with infirmities, though not with sinful ones, and as our High Priest was rendered pitiful and compassionate to us under our temptations, so as to intercede for us above, as he did pray for himself on earth, and to procure for us succour under and deliverance from them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hebrews/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who in the days of his flesh,.... Or "of his humanity", as the Arabic version renders it; or "when he was clothed with flesh", as the Syriac version; in the time of his humiliation, when he was attended with the sinless infirmities of the flesh, or human nature; it may take in the whole course of his life on earth, especially the latter part of it: it is not to be concluded from hence, that he has not flesh now, or is not in the flesh; for it is certain that he had flesh after his resurrection; only now he is free from all the infirmities of the flesh, the pains, and sorrows, and griefs of it, which he endured when here on earth: <p>when he had offered up prayers and supplications; as he often did in many parts of his life, particularly in the garden, and upon the cross, when he offered up himself: and as the days of Christ's flesh were filled up with prayers and supplications, so should ours be also: the word for "supplications" signifies branches of olive trees, covered with wool (d); which such as sued for peace carried in their hands, and so came to signify supplications for peace: the manner in which these were offered up by Christ was <p>with strong crying and tears; with a most vehement outcry, with a loud voice, as when on the cross; and though there is no mention of his tears at that time, or when in the garden, no doubt but he shed them: all that Christ did, and said, are not written; some things were received by tradition, and by inspiration; Christ wept at other times, and why not at these? and there are some circumstances in his prayers which intimate as much, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a> which shows the weight of sin, of sorrow, and of punishment, that lay upon him, and the weakness of the human nature, considered in itself: and it may be observed to our comfort, that as Christ's crying and tears were confined to the days of his flesh, or to the time of his life here on earth, so shall ours be also. Mention is made of , "strong prayers" (e), in Jewish writings. The person to whom Christ offered his prayers is described in the following words, <p>unto him that was able to save him from death; from a corporeal death, as he could, but that it was otherwise determined; or rather to raise him from the dead, to deliver him from the state of the dead, from the power of death, and the grave, as he did; and so the Syriac version renders it, "to quicken him from death"; to restore him from death to life: <p>and was heard in that he feared; or "by fear"; by God, who was the object of his fear, and who is called the fear of Isaac, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a> he was always heard by him, and so he was in the garden, and on the cross; and was carried through his sufferings, and was delivered from the fear of death, and was saved from the dominion and power of it, being raised from the dead by his Father: or "he was heard because of his fear", or "reverence"; either because of the dignity and reverence of his person, in which he was had by God; or because of his reverence of his Father. <p>(d) Harpocration.

II. 1, p. 399 f. 2 Aufl.) strangely supposes, of the supplication of Jesus, which He before (!) the learning of obedience offered for Himself as a sacrifice on account of weakness (!), with the sin-offering which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-3.htm" title="And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.">Hebrews 5:3</a>, the Levitical high priest had on this day to present for himself before he could yet offer on behalf of the people,—the author has present to his mind, according to the prevailing and, beyond doubt, <span class="ital">correct</span> view, the prayer of Christ in Gethsemane, as this was made known to him by oral or written tradition.

It is true we do not read in our Gospels that Christ at that time prayed to God <span class="greekheb">μετὰ δακρύων</span>. But, considering the great emotion of mind on the part of the Saviour, which is also described in the account given by our evangelists (comp. in particular, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-37.htm" title="And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.">Matthew 26:37</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο λυπείσθαι καὶ ἀδημονεῖν</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-33.htm" title="And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;">Mark 14:33</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο ἐκθαμβεῖσθαι καὶ ἀδημονεῖν</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-44.htm" title="And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.">Luke 22:44</a> : <span class="greekheb">καὶ γενόμενος ἐν ἀγωνίᾳ ἐκτενέστερον προσηύχετο ἐγένετο δὲ ὁ ἱδρῶς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ θρόμβοι αἵματος καταβαίνοντες ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν</span>), that fact has nothing improbable about it; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-35.htm" title="Jesus wept.">John 11:35</a>. On account of the addition <span class="greekheb">μετὰ κραυγῆς ἰσχυρᾶς</span>, others will have us understand <span class="ital">the loud crying of Christ upon the cross</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-34.htm" title="And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Mark 15:34</a>), either, as Calvin, Cornelius a Lapide, Piscator, Owen, Limborch, Schulz, Stein, Stuart, Delitzsch, <span class="ital">besides the prayer in Gethsemane</span>, or, as Cajetan, Estius, Calov, Hammond, Kurtz, <span class="ital">exclusively</span>, or even, as Klee, <span class="ital">the last cry, with which He departed</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-50.htm" title="Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.">Matthew 27:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-37.htm" title="And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.">Mark 15:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>). The supposition of such references we cannot, with de Wette (comp. also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 70 f. 2 Aufl.), characterize as “entirely-unsuitable.” For de Wette’s objection, that the author “manifestly regarded the prayer as the preparation and condition of the <span class="greekheb">ἔμαθε</span>,” that it must “thus precede the suffering,” does not apply, since <span class="greekheb">προσενέγκας</span> is not to be resolved into “after,” but into “in that,” or “inasmuch as.” Not as “preparation and condition of the <span class="greekheb">ἔμαθε</span>” is the prayer looked upon by the author, but rather is the historic fact of the fervent prayer of Christ mentioned by him as an evidence that Christ in reality submitted Himself to God, even in the severest sufferings. For that which Hofmann (<span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 67) objects hereto, that the author, if he had meant this, would have written: <span class="greekheb">μαθὼν ἀφʼ ὧν ἔπαθεν τὴν ὑπακοὴν δεήσεις τε καὶ ἱκετηρίας προσήνεγκεν</span>, is devoid of sense; because, by means of such a transposition, that which is merely a secondary statement would be made the main statement. Yet the supposing of such references is not necessary, since also the plural <span class="greekheb">δεήσεις τε καὶ ἱκετηρίας</span>, to which appeal has been made, is sufficiently explained by the repetitions of the prayer in the garden of Gethsemane.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To <span class="greekheb">ἱκετηρία</span>, which conjoined with <span class="greekheb">δέησις</span> further occurs LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-22.htm" title="The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.">Job 40:22</a> [27], as also with the classic writers, <span class="greekheb">ἐλαία</span> or <span class="greekheb">ῥάβδος</span> (not <span class="greekheb">κλάδος</span>) is originally to be supplemented, inasmuch as it denotes the olive branch which the supplicant pleading for protection bore in his hand. Later it acquired like signification with <span class="greekheb">ἱκετεία</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἱκεσία</span>. It implies thus the prostrate or urgent entreaty of one seeking refuge. As an intensifying of <span class="greekheb">δέησις</span> it is rightly placed after this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν δυνάμενον σώζειν αὐτὸν ἐκ θανάτου</span>] is most naturally referred to <span class="greekheb">προσενέγκας</span> (so Calvin, Abresch, <span class="ital">al</span>.). To the connecting with <span class="greekheb">δεήσεις τε καὶ ἱκετηρίας</span> (Böhme, Bleek, de Wette, Delitzsch, Alford, Maier, Moll) we are forced neither by the position before <span class="greekheb">μετὰ κραυγῆς ἰσχυρᾶς</span>, nor by the fact of the combination of <span class="greekheb">προσφέρειν</span> with the dative being chosen elsewhere in the epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>), as it is also the more usual one with classical writers, since likewise the conjoining with <span class="greekheb">πρός</span> is nothing out of the way. Comp. <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Polyb. iv. 51. 2 : <span class="greekheb">προσενεγκάμενοι πρὸς τὸν Ἀχαιὸν</span> (equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τῷ Ἀχαιῷ</span>) <span class="greekheb">τὴν χάριν ταύτην</span>. In the characteristic of God as the One who was able to deliver Christ from death, there lies, at the same time, the indication of that which Christ implored of God. <span class="greekheb">σώζειν ἐκ θανάτου</span>, however, may denote one of two things, either: <span class="ital">to save from death</span>, in such wise that it needs not to be undergone, thus to preserve from death, or: <span class="ital">to save out of</span> the <span class="ital">death</span> to which one is exposed, so that one does not remain the prey of death, but is restored to life. In favour of the former interpretation seems to plead the fact that Christ, according to the account in the Gospels, in reality prayed that He might be spared the suffering of death. Nevertheless what decides against this, and in favour of the second, is the consideration, in the first place, that Christ in reality still suffered death, and then the addition in our verse that the prayer of Christ was answered. And then, finally, we have to take into account the fact that, according to our Gospels also, Christ does not pray <span class="ital">absolutely</span> to be preserved from death, but makes this His wish dependent upon the will of the Father, thus entirely subordinates Himself to the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰσακουσθεὶς ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλαβείας</span>] <span class="ital">and being heard by reason of His piety</span>, or fear of God.

II. p. 270. Christ, however, was heard in His prayer, inasmuch as He was raised out of death, exalted to the right hand of God, and made partaker of the divine glory. To be rejected is the explanation of the word preferred by Ambrose, Calvin, Beza, Cameron, Scaliger, Schlichting, Grotius, Owen, Hammond, Limborch, “Wolf, Bengel, Wetstein, Whitby, Carpzov, Abresch, Böhme, Kuinoel, Paulus, Klee, Stuart, Stein, Ebrard, Bloomfield, Grimm (Theol.

II. 1, p. 69, 2 Aufl.), and many others, according to which a pregnancy of meaning is assumed for the same, and <span class="greekheb">εὐλάβεια</span> is interpreted in the sense of “metus:” “<span class="ital">heard</span> (and delivered) <span class="ital">from the fear</span>.” There is then found expressed in it either the thought (and this is the common acceptation) that Christ was delivered from His agony of soul by the strengthening on the part of the angel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm" title="And there appeared an angel to him from heaven, strengthening him.">Luke 22:43</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Who</span>] i.e. the Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of his flesh</span>] The word “flesh” is here used for His Humanity regarded on the side of its weakness and humiliation.

The word rendered “prayers” (<span class="ital">deçseis</span>) is rather “supplications,” i.e. “special prayers” for the supply of needs; the word rendered “entreaties” (which is joined with it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-3.htm" title="Will he make many supplications to you? will he speak soft words to you?">Job 41:3</a>, comp. 2 Mace. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-18.htm" title="Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.">Hebrews 9:18</a>) properly meant olive-boughs (<span class="greekheb">ἱκετηρίαι</span>) held forth to entreat protection. Thus the first word refers to the suppliant, the second implies an approach (<span class="greekheb">ἱκετηρίαι</span>) to God. The “supplications and entreaties “referred to are doubtless those in the Agony at Gethsemane (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-39.htm" title="And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him....">Luke 22:39-46</a>), though there may be a reference to the Cross, and some have even supposed that there is an allusion to Psalms 22, 116.

The old Latin (<span class="ital">Vetus Itala</span>) renders “<span class="ital">exauditus a metu</span>,” and some Latin Fathers and later interpreters explain it to mean “having been freed <span class="ital">from the fear of death</span>.” The Greek might perhaps be made to bear this sense, though the mild word used for “fear” is not in favour of it; but the rendering given above, meaning that His prayer was heard because of His awful submission (<span class="ital">Proverbs suâ reverentiâ</span>, Vulg.) is the sense in which the words are taken by all the Greek Fathers. The word rendered “from” (<span class="ital">apo</span>) may certainly mean “because of” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm" title="And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.">Luke 19:3</a>, “He could not because of (<span class="ital">apo</span>) the crowd;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-41.htm" title="And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here any meat?">Luke 24:41</a>, “disbelieving because of (<span class="ital">apo</span>) their joy” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-6.htm" title="And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find.

The word rendered “feared” is <span class="ital">eulabeia</span>, which means “reverent fear,” or “reasonable shrinking” as opposed to terror and cowardice. The Stoics said that the wise man could thus cautiously shrink (<span class="ital">eulabeisthai</span>) but never actually be afraid (<span class="ital">phobeisthai</span>). Other attempts to explain away the passage arise from the Apollinarian tendency to deny Christ’s perfect <span class="ital">manhood</span>: but He was “perfectly man “as well as “truly God.” He was not indeed “saved <span class="ital">from</span> death,” because He had only prayed that “the cup might pass from Him” if such were His Father’s will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.">Hebrews 10:7</a>); but He was saved <span class="ital">out of</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>) death” by being raised on the third day, so that “He saw no corruption.” For the word <span class="ital">eulabeia</span>, “piety” or “reverent awe” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὃς</span>, <span class="ital">who</span>) namely <span class="ital">Christ, the Son of God, the Priest.

When the cup was presented, there was also presented to the soul of the Saviour the horrible image of death, which was joined with sorrow, ignominy, and cursing, and was of a lingering nature, and He was moved to pray for the removal of the cup. But the purity of filial affection in the Saviour with the exercise of holy reason and moderation instantly softened that horror, and subsequently absorbed it completely, as the serenity of His mind returned. And <span class="ital">He was heard</span>, not that He should not drink the cup, but that He should now drink it without any horror; whence also He was strengthened by an angel. The fear was a something more horrible than death itself; when the feeling of horror was taken away before the coming of His enemies, He lays it down as a fixed principle, that the cup which he had wished conditionally not to drink, now cannot but be drunk. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm" title="Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?">John 18:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠῸ</span></span></span>) An abbreviated expression, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸΣΑΚΟΥΣΘΕῚς ἈΠῸ</span></span></span>, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘῤῬΑΝΤΙΣΜΈΝΟΙ ἈΠῸ</span></span></span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>.

This main intention of vers. 7, 8 must be kept in mind for a proper understanding of them. Christ is in them regarded, not as executing his priestly office, but as being prepared and consecrated for it. His eternal priesthood is conceived as entered on <span class="accented">after</span> the human experience which is the subject of these verses (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (ver. 9), and what was said under ver. 5). With regard to the participial aorists, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, it is a misapprehension of their proper force to regard them as denoting a time <span class="accented">previous</span> to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8; as if the meaning were - having in Gethsemane "offered," etc., and "been heard," he <span class="accented">afterwards</span> "learnt obedience" on the cross. All they express is that in offering, etc., and being heard, he learned obedience. The idea of subsequent time does not come in till ver. 9; "and being perfected," after thus learning obedience, "he became," etc. Thus the only question with regard to <span class="accented">time</span> in vers. 7, 8 is whether they have reference to the agony in the garden only, or both to the agony and the cross. That they refer mainly, if not exclusively, to the agony is evident from the expressions used, corresponding so closely with the Gospel history. The view presented is, as in the Gospels, of some intense inward struggle, outwardly manifested, and expressing itself in repeated prayers (observe the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) aloud for deliverance. It is true that the Gospels, as we have them now, do not mention <span class="accented">tears</span>; but these too are quite in keeping with the bloody sweat specified by St. Luke, and Epiphanius states that the original copies of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43, 44</a> contained the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. Some interpreters would identify <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> of ver. 7 with the "loud voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>)" from the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). But there is nothing to suggest this; the "strong crying and tears" evidently denote the manner of the "prayers and supplications;" and the thrice-repeated prayer in the garden recorded by the evangelists may be well conceived to have been thus loudly uttered, so as to be heard by the three <span class="accented">disciples</span>, a stone's cast distant, before sleep overcame them. "In cruce clamasse dicitur; lachrymasse non dicitur. Utrum horum respicit locum Gethsemane" (Bengel). What, then, as seen in the light of these verses, was the meaning of the "prayer and supplications" in the garden of Gethsemane? The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>, confirms the view that the "cup" which he prayed might pass from him, was the death before him, and that the purport of his prayer was, not to be raised from death after undergoing it, but to be saved from undergoing it. Such is the ordinary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in reference to one still alive (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-19.htm">Psalm 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). It does not indeed positively follow that, because he prayed to One who was able in this sense to save him, his prayer was that he might be in this sense saved. It is, however, the natural inference. But, if so, two difficulties present themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> How was such a prayer consistent with his distinct knowledge that death must be undergone, and his late strong rebuke to Peter for venturing to dissuade him from it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> How can he be said to have been <span class="accented">heard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>), since he was not saved from death in the sense intended? To the first of these questions the answer is that the prayer expressed, not the deliberate desire of his Divine will, but only the inevitable shrinking of the human will from such an ordeal as was before him. As man, he experienced this shrinking to the full, and as man he craved deliverance, though with entire submission to the will of the Father. His human will did not oppose itself to the Divine will: it conformed itself in the end entirely to it; but this according to the necessary conditions of humanity, through the power of prayer. Had it not been so with him, his participation in human nature would have been incomplete; he would not have been such as to be "touched with a feeling of our infirmities, being in all things tempted like as we are;" nor would he have stood forth for ever as the great Example to mankind. St. John, who so deeply enters into and interprets the mind of Christ, records an utterance before the agony which anticipates its meaning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12.htm">John 12</a>): "The hour is come" (ver. 23); and then (ver. 27), "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour [cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>]; but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy Name." The "hour" was that of the drinking of the cup (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-35.htm">Mark 14:35</a>, "And prayed that, if it were possible, the <span class="accented">hour</span> might pass from him"). "Father, save me from this hour" was the human craving of the agony; but still, "Father, glorify thy Name" was the essence of the prayer; and perfect submission to the Divine will was the outcome of it, after this <span class="accented">troubling</span> of his human soul. The mystery surrounding the whole subject of the Divine and human in Christ remains still. What was said with regard to it about the temptation in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>) is applicable also here. If it be further asked how it was that Christ, in his humanity, so shrank from the "cup" before him, seeing that mere men have been found to face death calmly in its most appalling forms, the answer may be found in the consideration of what this cup implied. It was more than physical death, more than physical pain, more than any sorrow that falls to the lot of man.

Of the <span class="accented">second</span> difficulty mentioned above, as to how Christ was "heard," not having been saved "from death" in the apparent sense of his prayer, the solution may be that the prayer, conditioned as it was by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, was most truly answered by the angel sent to strengthen him, and the power thenceforth given him to "endure the cross, despising the shame." "Mortem ex qua Pater cum liberare posset, ne moreretur, tamen subiit, voluntati Patris obediens: ab horrore plane liberatus est per exauditionem Exauditus est, non ut ne biberet calicem, sed ut jam sine ullo horrore biberet: unde etiam per angelum corroboratus est" (Bengel). The example to us thus becomes the more apparent. For we, too, praying legitimately for release from excessive trial, may have our prayer best answered by grace given to endure the trial, and by "a happy issue" out of it; as was the case with Christ. For his bitter passion was made the path to eternal glory; and thus in the Resurrection too his prayer was answered. The exact meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is not easy to determine. It is taken by a large proportion of commentators to mean "deliverance from his fear;" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> being supposed to be a <span class="accented">constructio praegnans</span> in the sense of "heard so as to be delivered," and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to denote the dread experienced in Gethsemane. So the old Italian Versions, and Ambrose, "exauditus a metu;" so Bengel, "ab hrr-rore liberatus per exauditlonem." This interpretation is upheld by Beza, Grotius, Tholuck, Hofmann, Ebrard, and many others; some of whom, less tenably (as Calvin, Hammond, Jackson), understand <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as meaning, not the fear felt, but the thing feted: "ab eo quod timebat" (Calvin).

The rendering hence preferred by many, having the authority of Chrysostom, and among moderns of Lunemann, Bleek, Delitzsch, Alford, and others, is that of the Vulgate, "exauditus pro sua reverentia." So Vigilius, "propter timorem;" the A.V.," heard in that he feared," or, as in the margin, "heard for his piety;" and in the recent revision, "for his godly fear;" which is the A.V.'s rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>. The objection to the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> to express the <span class="accented">cause</span> of his being heard is met by reference to the frequent usage of St. Luke, whose language most resembles that of our Epistle. Thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm">Luke 19:3</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-14.htm">Acts 12:14</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-11.htm">Acts 22:11</a>). The phrase, thus understood, brings out the more markedly the thoroughly human conditions to which Christ was subjected. It was not in right of his sonship that he was heard. He won his hearing by his human piety; though he was SON, and as such knew that his Father heard him always (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a>), he learnt humanly his lesson of obedience. In the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Son</span> is surely meant in the peculiar sense in which it has all along been applied to Christ, expressing more than that his relation to God was that of <span class="accented">any</span> son to a father, and thus we perceive the full force of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>. It is true that it was not till after the Resurrection that he attained his exalted position as SON (see under Hebrews 1:5 and Hebrews 5:5); but still he was all along the Son, in virtue of his origin as well as of his destiny. Cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>). <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> does not indeed, in itself, express that he was the Second Person of the Trinity (this application of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> being nowhere found in the Epistle); but it implies that, even in his state of humiliation, he was more than man; for there would be nothing very extraordinary, so as to justify <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, in the case of an ordinary son learning obedience to his father through suffering. Recurring now to the question raised under ver. 3, whether the high priest's obligation to offer in the first place for himself had any counterpart in the case of Christ, we may perceive such a counterpart in the agony, as above regarded. For, although for himself Christ needed no atonement, yet the "prayers and supplications" were offered in his own behalf, being due to his own entire participation in the conditions of humanity; the whole "agony and bloody sweat" were part of his own preparation and consecration for executing the office of a High Priest for others, and, like the Aaronic priest's offering for himself, they were the sign and evidence of his being one <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> being all along understood) they answered truly to the preparatory part of Aaron's original consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14 - 9:15</a>), or to the high priest's own offering, before his offering for the people and entering behind the veil, on the Day of Atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-6.htm">Leviticus 14:6</a>). It may be (though not necessarily so) that the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 7, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 3, is intended to suggest this analogy. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He is now to show that Christ was under training for the priesthood, and describes the process of training.<p>Who (&#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Nominative to &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; learned, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>, to which all the participles are preparatory.<p>In the days of his flesh (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>During his mortal life.<p>When he had offered up prayers and supplications (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; special, definite requests: &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, N.T.o , is properly an adjective, pertaining to or fit for suppliants, with &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; staves or &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; olive-branches understood.

To save him from death may mean to deliver him from the fear of death, from the anguish of death, or from remaining a prey to death. In either case, the statement connects itself with the thought of Christ's real humanity. He was under the pressure of a sore human need which required divine help, thus showing that he was like unto his brethren. He appealed to one who could answer his prayer. The purport of the prayer is not stated. It is at least suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>.<p>And was heard in that he feared (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Rend. was heard on account of his godly fear. &#x395;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>.

He was heard, for his prayer was answered, whatever it may have been. God was able to save him from death altogether. He did not do this. He was able to sustain him under the anguish of death, and to give him strength to suffer the Father's will: he was also able to deliver him from death by resurrection: both these he did. It is not impossible that both these may be combined in the statement he was heard. </body></html>
