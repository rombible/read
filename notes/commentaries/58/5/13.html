Those who are addressed had lost interest in the deeper truths of Christianity, those truths which alone expressed and explained its proper nature. Their temptation apparently was towards mingling a rudimentary Christian doctrine with the teaching of the synagogue. Yielding to this they would lose all real Knowledge of the very elements of Christian truth, and with this all true knowledge of the Old Testament itself. The connection between this verse and the last may probably be, <span class= "ital">Ye have come to need milk, for</span>—<span class= "ital">making it by choice your sole food</span>—<span class= "ital">ye stand self-confessed as babes.</span><p><span class= "bld">Unskilful.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">without experience.</span> The “word of righteousness” evidently must signify complete, properly-developed Christian teaching. The only question is, Why is this particular designation chosen? In the Epistle to the Romans such a description would be natural (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-31.htm" title="But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.">Romans 9:31</a>); but “righteousness” is not the direct and manifest subject of this Epistle. Still, the expressions of which the writer makes use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm" title="By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.">Hebrews 11:7</a>, together with the general similarity between his teaching and St. Paul’s, go very far towards explaining his choice of this special expression as descriptive of the religion of Christ. In like manner another phrase, “law of liberty,” is characteristic of St. James.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:11-14 Dull hearers make the preaching of the gospel difficult, and even those who have some faith may be dull hearers, and slow to believe.

Christian experience is a spiritual sense, taste, or relish of the goodness, sweetness, and excellence of the truths of the gospel.

Expositors have almost without exception been guided by the presupposition (as also Bleek, de Wette, Tholuck, Kurtz still are) that <span class="greekheb">λόγος δικαιοσύνης</span> is only a varying form of expression for the same idea as is expressed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>, by <span class="greekheb">στερεὰ τροφή</span>, or, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>, by <span class="greekheb">τελειότης</span>. <span class="greekheb">λόγος δικαιοσύνης</span> has then either been taken as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">λόγος δίκαιος</span> or <span class="greekheb">τέλειος</span>, and the higher, more perfect type of doctrine found indicated in the expression. So Schlichting (“sermo justitiae videtur positus pro sermone justo, h. e. perfecto ac solido”), Grotius (“Hic <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνης</span> dixit pro <span class="greekheb">τελειότητος</span> … et genitivus est pro adjective”), Abresch (“doctrina vel institutio justa, h. e. perfecta, plena, omnia complectens, quae ad perspicuam distinctamque pertineant doctrinae Christianae intelligentiam”), Schulz (“that true [rightly so called] higher doctrine”), Kuinoel, Bisping, Kurtz, and many others. Or <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνης</span> has been more correctly regarded as genitive of the object. In the latter case <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> is taken either, as Michaelis, <span class="ital">ad Peirc.</span>, with an appeal to the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">צְדָקָה</span>, in the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span>,[75] as the doctrine of the essence of the matter itself, in opposition to the typical figures thereof; or <span class="greekheb">λόγος δικαιοσύνης</span> is understood specially, as by Oecumenius, of the <span class="greekheb">λόγος περὶ τῆς θεότητος τοῦ κυρίου</span>, or, as by Carpzov, of the: “doctrina de sacerdotio Jesu Christi Melchisedeciano, quae dicitur <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος δικαιοσύνης</span> propterea, quia Melchisedecus, vi nominis, <span class="greekheb">βασιλεὺς δικαιοσύνης</span> vertitur, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-2.htm" title="To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;">Hebrews 7:2</a>, eaque appellatio ad Christum sacerdotem applicatur, cujus <span class="greekheb">πρέπον</span> fuit <span class="greekheb">πληρῶσαι πᾶσαν δικαιοσύνην</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-15.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.">Matthew 3:15</a>;” or the words are made to refer, as by Primasius, Zeger, Bengel, de Wette, and others, to <span class="ital">intellectual and moral perfection in general</span>, as also already Chrysostom, who explains the expression by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ἌΝΩ ΦΙΛΟΣΟΦΊΑ</span></span></span> (and after him Theophylact), leaves us the choice of understanding the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΊΟς ἌΚΡΟς ΚΑῚ ἨΚΡΙΒΩΜΈΝΟς</span></span></span> (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20</a>), or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΧΡΙΣΤῸΝ ΚΑῚ ΤῸΝ ὙΨΗΛῸΝ ΠΕΡῚ ΑὐΤΟῦ ΛΌΓΟΝ</span></span></span>. But the fundamental presupposition, out of which all these interpretations have sprung, is an erroneous one. For the emphasis falls not upon <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΌΓΟς ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗς</span></span></span>, but upon the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΠΕΙΡΟς</span></span></span>, on that account preposed. Not for a non-possession of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΌΓΟς ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗς</span></span></span>, but only for a want of experience in the same, only for an insufficient, schoolboy’s knowledge of it, does the author blame the readers. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΌΓΟς ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗς</span></span></span> in itself, therefore, stands as indifferently related to the notion of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΕΡΕᾺ ΤΡΟΦΉ</span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΛΕΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span> as to the notion of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΟΙΧΕῖΑ</span></span></span>, to which Ebrard reckons it. Only by the more or less exhaustive imparting of its subject-matter does it become the one or the other. For the word of righteousness is nothing more than a periphrasis of Christianity or the gospel, inasmuch as just the righteousness availing with God[76] is the central-point of its contents. Quite analogous to this mode of designation is the Pauline characterization of the gospel office of teaching by <span class="greekheb">ἠ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-9.htm" title="For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.">2 Corinthians 3:9</a>, and of the teachers of Christianity by <span class="greekheb">διάκονοι δικαιοσύνης</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>; on which account also it is unnecessary, for the justification of the expression chosen, with Bleek, Bisping, and Maier, to assume an allusion to the exposition of the name Melchisedec, <span class="greekheb">βασιλεὺς δικαιοσύνης</span>, given <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-2.htm" title="To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;">Hebrews 7:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">νήπιος γάρ ἐστιν</span>] <span class="ital">for he is still a babe</span>, a novice in Christianity. Setting forth of the naturalness of the <span class="greekheb">ἄπειρος λόγου δικαιοσύνης</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[75] Delitzsch, too, with an allusion to the use of צֶדֶק, ישֶׁר, מֵישָׁרִים, takes <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> as a synonym of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span>; but will then have the genitive <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνης</span> looked upon not as expressing the contents, but as a defining of the quality of <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, and will interpret <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> of the faculty of speech. Thus, then, <span class="greekheb">λόγος δικαιοσύνης</span> is taken to mean: “the faculty of speaking in accordance with righteousness,” i.e. the “discourse on spiritual things which is guided in strict accord with the norm of the true, and harmoniously combines all the factors of the case, proportionately regarded, without leaving one of them out of sight;” and in ver. 13 is supposed to be contained the following “most rigid connection of ideas:” “he who must still receive milk is still ignorant of rightly-constituted, i.e. right-teaching or orthodox, discourse; for he is a child only beginning to lisp, and not yet capable of speech.” This strange view, based upon the incomprehensible grounds, that “since <span class="greekheb">νήπιος</span> (from <span class="greekheb">νη</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἔπος</span>) denotes one incapable of speech, an infant, there is a presumption in favour of <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> in <span class="greekheb">ἄπειρος λόγου δικαιοσύνης</span> having the signification of faculty of speech,—and this signification is here the more probable in regard to the <span class="greekheb">αἰσθησήρια</span> occurring in the antithetic parallel clause, inasmuch as <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος</span>, in the sense of language, is met with countless times in Philo along with the <span class="greekheb">αἴσθησις</span> or the <span class="greekheb">πέντε αἰσθήσεις</span>, of which the organs are known as <span class="greekheb">αἰσθητήρια</span>,”—bears its refutation upon the face of it. It is not at all suitable to the connection, as Riehm (Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr. p. 734) and Alford have already observed; since according to this there is no question as to the faculty for speaking on spiritual subjects, but only as to the faculty for understanding the same.—As “discourse” will Hofmann also have <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> interpreted, in that he fully subtilizes the notion lying in <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, and finds indicated by the total expression <span class="greekheb">λόγος δικαιοσύνης</span> only “correct discourse.” For, according to him, the words ver. 13 are used in their most literal sense, and allude to the fact that he who is still fed with milk at the maternal breast is as yet no judge of correct discourse!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] Of the righteousness availing with God (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm" title="By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.">Hebrews 11:7</a>), have Beza, Jac. Cappellus, Peirce, Storr, Klee, Tholuck, Bleek, Stein, Ebrard, Bloomfield, and others already rightly interpreted <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>.—In the above exposition, Alford, Riehm (<span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 733), and Woerner have concurred; save that, according to Riehm, by virtue of an over-refined distinction, the gospel is not called the word of righteousness “because the righteousness availing with God is the central-point of its contents,” but “because it leads to righteousness; because, by its proclamation to man, the possibility is created and the opportunity is afforded of entering into a condition of the rightness of his relation to God, inasmuch, namely, as he assumes a believing attitude towards the word proclaimed.” But why should the author, familiar as he was with Paul’s manner of teaching, and attaching his own doctrinal presentation thereto,—albeit with independence of character,—have shrunk from recognising, as the central theme of the gospel, “the righteousness which avails with God,” since even this was only a general notion, which did not exclude a peculiar conception and treatment, where it was a question of the development of details, and insistance thereon?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-13.htm" title="For every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.">Hebrews 5:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">πᾶς γὰρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">νήπιος γάρ ἐστι</span>. “For every one who partakes of milk [as his sole diet] is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.” The reference of <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> is somewhat obscure. It seems intended to substantiate the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a> : “Ye cannot receive solid food, <span class="ital">for</span> you have no experience of the word of righteousness”. But he softens the statement by generalising it. Every one that lives on milk is necessarily unacquainted with the higher teaching, which is now <span class="greekheb">λόγος δικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄπειρος</span> having no experience of, ignorant; as <span class="greekheb">κακότητος ἄπειροι</span>, Empedocles in Fairbanks, <span class="ital">Phil. of Greece</span>, p. 202. <span class="greekheb">ἄπειρος ἀγρεύειν</span>, Babrius, lxix. 2; <span class="greekheb">ἄπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀγωνίζεσθαι</span>, Antiphon, Jebb, p. 8. <span class="greekheb">λόγου δικαιοσύνης</span>, with teaching of righteous conduct the suckling has nothing to do; he cannot act for himself, but can merely live and grow; he cannot discern good and evil, and must take what is given him. Righteousness is not within the suckling’s horizon. He cannot as yet be taught it; still less can he be a teacher of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>) <span class="greekheb">νήπιος γάρ ἐστι</span>, for he cannot even speak [<span class="greekheb">νη</span>-<span class="greekheb">ἔπος</span> = infans], he is an infant. The infant can neither understand nor impart teaching regarding a life of which he has no experience, and whose language he does not know. Indirectly, this involves that the higher instruction the writer wished to deliver was important because of its bearing on conduct. [Other interpretations abound. Chrysostom and Theophylact understand the reference to be either to the Christian life or to Christ Himself and the knowledge of His person. Others, as Beza, Lünemann, and many others, take it as “a periphrasis for Christianity or the Gospel, inasmuch as the righteousness which avails with God is precisely the contents of the Gospel”. Riehm also thinks that the Gospel is meant, “because it leads to righteousness”. Westcott understands it of the “teaching which deals at once with the one source of righteousness in Christ, and the means by which man is enabled to be made partaker of it”. The view of Carpzov, and also that of Bleek, is governed by the connection of Melchizedek with righteousness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-2.htm" title="To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;">Hebrews 7:2</a>.]<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">that useth milk</span>] The meaning is “who feeds on milk.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unskilful</span>] “Inexperienced.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for he is a babe</span>] This is a frequent metaphor in St Paul, who also contrasts “babes” (<span class="ital">nçpioi</span>) with the mature (<span class="ital">teleioi</span>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:...">Ephesians 4:13-14</a>.

"Word of righteousness" may be taken as a general term to denote what we might call religious lore; referring here especially to the gospel, which is eminently the revelation of the "righteousness of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-9.htm">2 Corinthians 3:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: and 2 Cor 11:15, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>); but not excluding a more general conception. There is no need to suppose an exclusive reference to the more perfect doctrine in opposition to the elements, since, of the whole subject of religious knowledge, the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be said to be <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of being without the matured skill that experience gives. Hence, too, we are certainly not justified in finding in the phrase a specific allusion to the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith only, which is not suggested by the context or by what follows. Still less may we (with Delitzsch) so ignore the notable significance of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as to reduce the expression to a synonym for "rightly framed, that is sound and orthodox discourse." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Useth (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Rend. partakes of.

It is a mistake to attempt to give the phrase here a concrete meaning. It signifies simply a word of normally right character. It is not  equals  the Christian revelation, which would require the article. Probably, however, in the foreground of the writer's thought was the word spoken by the Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>); the salvation which at first was spoken by the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>).<p>A babe (&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-20.htm">Romans 2:20</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>. </body></html>
