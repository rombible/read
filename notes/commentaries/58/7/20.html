Hitherto no reference has been made to the remarkable opening of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>, so often quoted: these three verses are occupied with the thought of the oath—or rather (for a very uncommon word is used, one that answers well to the importance of the thought) the “swearing of an oath.” This is a further illustration of the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-15.htm" title="And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there rises another priest,">Hebrews 7:15</a>, “a different priest.”<p><span class= "bld">He was made priest.</span>—Some supplement is needed to give clearness to the English sentence; but one of general meaning, such as “all this was done,” will best answer the purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-20.htm" title="And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:...">Hebrews 7:20-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">And inasmuch as, </span>&c. — Here is another argument from the words of the psalmist, to prove the appointment of a new priesthood, the removal of the old, and the superior excellence of the new to the old; <span class="ital">not without an oath </span>— Which argues the weightiness of the matter, and the eternal continuance of Christ’s priesthood. “The apostle’s reasoning here is founded on this, that God never interposed his oath except to show the certainty and immutability of the thing sworn. Thus he sware to Abraham, that in <span class="ital">his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:...">Genesis 22:16-18</a>; and to the rebellious Israelites, that <span class="ital">they should not enter into his rest, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/1-34.htm" title="And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,...">Deuteronomy 1:34-35</a>; and to Moses, that <span class="ital">he should not go into Canaan, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-21.htm" title="Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance:">Deuteronomy 4:21</a>; and to David, that <span class="ital">his seed should endure for ever, and his throne unto all generations, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm" title="Your seed will I establish for ever, and build up your throne to all generations. Selah.">Psalm 89:4</a>. Wherefore, since Christ was made a priest <span class="ital">not without an oath, </span>that he should be a priest for ever, &c., that circumstance showed God’s immutable resolution never to change or abolish his priesthood, or the covenant established thereon. Whereas the Levitical priesthood and the law of Moses being established <span class="ital">without an oath </span>were thereby declared to be changeable at God’s pleasure.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">The Lord sware and will not repent </span>— Hence also it appears that his priesthood is unchangeable. God not only sware that he would make him <span class="ital">a priest for ever, </span>but sware also that he would never repent of doing it. <span class="ital">By so much, </span>&c. — By how much the priesthood of Christ was better than the former, by so much the testament, or rather <span class="ital">covenant, </span>of which he was to be surety, was better also. The word <span class="ital">covenant </span>frequently occurs in the remaining part of this epistle. The original word means either a covenant, or a last will and testament. St. Paul takes it sometimes in the former, sometimes in the latter sense; sometimes he includes both. The word <span class="ital">surety </span>or <span class="ital">sponsor, </span>may here mean one who has undertaken, on our behalf, to satisfy divine justice for our sins, making atonement for them; and to give to all that sincerely, earnestly, and perseveringly ask it, grace sufficient to enable them to perform the conditions of the covenant, and thereupon to receive its blessings. But it is proper to observe, that the Greek commentators explain the word <span class="greekheb">εγγυος</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">a surety, </span>by <span class="greekheb">μεσιτης</span>, <span class="ital">a mediator, </span>which is its etymological meaning. “For it comes from <span class="greekheb">εγγυς</span>, <span class="ital">near, </span>and signifies <span class="ital">one who draws near, </span>or who causes another to draw near. Now, as in this passage a comparison is stated between Jesus, as a High-Priest, and the Levitical high-priests; and as these were justly considered by the apostle as the mediators of the Sinai covenant, because through their mediation the Israelites worshipped God with sacrifices, and received from him, as their king, a political pardon, in consequence of the sacrifices offered by the high-priest on the day of atonement, it is evident that the apostle, in this passage, calls Jesus <span class="ital">the High-Priest, </span>or <span class="ital">Mediator, of the better covenant, </span>because through his mediation believers receive all the blessings of the better covenant. And, as the apostle had said, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>,) that, <span class="ital">by the introduction of a better hope, </span><span class="greekheb">εγγιζομεν</span>, <span class="ital">we draw near to God, </span>he, in this verse, very properly called Jesus <span class="greekheb">εγγυος</span>, rather than <span class="greekheb">μεσιτης</span>, to denote the effect of his mediation. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>. Our translators, indeed, following the Vulgate and Beza, have rendered the word <span class="ital">surety, </span>a sense which it hath, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/29-16.htm" title="A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety:">Sir 29:16</a>, and which naturally enough follows from its etymological meaning. For the person who becomes surety for the good behaviour of another, or for his performing something stipulated, brings that other near to the party to whom he gives the security; he reconciles the two. But in this sense, the word <span class="greekheb">εγγυος</span>, is not applicable to the Jewish high-priests. For to be <span class="ital">a proper surety, </span>one must either have power to compel the party to perform that for which he hath become his surety, or, in case of his not performing it, he must be able to perform it himself. As little is the appellation, <span class="ital">surety of the new covenant, </span>applicable to Jesus. For since the new covenant doth not require perfect obedience, but only the obedience of faith; if the obedience of faith is not given by men themselves, it cannot be given by another in their room, unless we suppose that men can be saved without personal faith; I therefore infer, that they who speak of Jesus as the <span class="ital">surety </span>of the new covenant, must hold that it requires perfect obedience, which not being in the power of believers to give, Jesus hath performed it for them. But is not this to make the covenant of grace a covenant of works, contrary to the whole tenor of Scripture? For these reasons, I think the Greek commentators have given the true meaning of the word <span class="greekheb">εγγυος </span>in this passage, when they explain it by <span class="greekheb">μεσιτης</span>, <span class="ital">Mediator.” — </span>Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:11-25 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are done away; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which true believers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And inasmuch as not without an oath - In addition to every other consideration showing the superiority of Christ as a priest, there was the solemnity of the oath by which he was set apart to the office. The appointment of one to the office of priest by an oath, such as occurred in the case of Jesus, was much more solemn and important than where the office was received merely by descent. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. Another proof of the superiority of Christ's Melchisedec-like priesthood; the oath of God gave a solemn weight to it which was not in the law-priesthood, which was not so confirmed.<p>he was made priest&#8212;rather supply from Heb 7:22, which completes the sentence begun in this verse, Heb 7:21 being a parenthesis, "inasmuch as not without an oath He was made surety of the testament (for, &c.), of so much better a testament hath Jesus been made the surety."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is a further proof of the excellency of Christ’s priesthood above Aaron’s, taken from his constitution in it by oath. He who is made a priest by oath, is a better and a greater priest than any made so without it; but so is Christ. Kay oson is a comparative, answered <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a></span>, insinuating by how much the cause constituting or confirming an office of priesthood is more excellent, by so much the effect and office must excel, receiving greater power for some more excellent end. This orkwmosia is as much as a double oath, apo tou omnuein orkon. By the swearing of an oath by God the Father was the gospel High Priest constituted an eternal one after Melchisedec’s order; and it addeth so much the more strength and glory to the sanction. This is testified by David, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a></span>. The Levitical priests were made by a Divine designation, and with external rites were consecrated; but Christ was constituted a Priest by oath, as our translators well supply it out of the following verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hebrews/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And inasmuch as not without an oath,....

Only this mode of supplementing is warranted by the connection, as is shown partly by the <span class="greekheb">οἱ μὲν γὰρ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς γεγονότες</span> immediately following, partly by the circumstance that the author is still engaged in the exposition of the Scripture statement, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-17.htm" title="For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 7:17</a>, this statement thus containing for him the gist of the matter; as, accordingly, this declaration of Scripture is repeated anew, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-21.htm" title="(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)">Hebrews 7:21</a>, and then likewise the <span class="greekheb">εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς γεγονότες</span> recurs in the further member of the thought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-23.htm" title="And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:">Hebrews 7:23</a> f.

Wrongly, Paulus and Klee: are priests who have become so without an oath. Böhme (and so also Hofmann): “sunt sacerdotes, sed sine juramento (illi quidem singuli deinceps) facti”—which must have been expressed by <span class="greekheb">εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας γεγονότες</span>. Still more widely mistaken the view of Michaelis <span class="ital">ad Peirc.: “fuerunt, i.e.</span> esse desierunt,”—which is grammatically as well as logically impossible. The <span class="ital">tempus periphrasticum</span> <span class="greekheb">εἰσὶν γεγονότες</span> marks the fact already belonging to the past as still extending onwards into the present.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ δέ</span>] namely, <span class="ital">Christ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μεθ</span> ̓ <span class="greekheb">ὁρκωμοσίας</span>] <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἱερεύς ἐστιν γεγονώς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ λέγοντος πρὸς αὐτόν</span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in the sense of the author: <span class="ital">by God</span>, not: <span class="ital">by the psalmist</span> (Rambach, Heinrichs), although certainly the statement, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>, that God hath sworn and will not repent of this oath, forms not a constituent part of the words of God Himself, but a remark of the psalmist, with which he introduces the words of God. Yet, when in the psalm it is said that God has sworn, and of this oath He will not repent, and then there is adduced as the subject-matter of this oath the declaration: <span class="greekheb">σὺ ἱερεὺς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., this is tantamount to saying that God has declared by virtue of an irreversible oath: <span class="greekheb">σὺ ἱερεὺς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. As, accordingly, the psalmist is relating the words of God, so does he also relate the oath which preceded them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-20.htm" title="And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:...">Hebrews 7:20-22</a>. Another element in the superiority of the covenant established upon the priesthood of Jesus is that in the very manner of the institution of His priesthood it was declared to be permanent. The long parenthesis of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-21.htm" title="(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)">Hebrews 7:21</a> being held aside the statement of 20–22 reads thus: “And [introducing a fresh consideration] in proportion as not without an oath [was He made priest] … in that proportion better is the covenant of which Jesus has become the surety”. The parenthesis of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-21.htm" title="(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)">Hebrews 7:21</a> is inserted to confirm by an appeal to Scripture [<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>] the fact that by the swearing of an oath the Melchizedek priest was appointed, and to indicate the significance of this mode of appointment, <span class="ital">viz</span>.: that repentance or change of plan is excluded. That is to say, this priesthood is final, eternal. And the superiority of the priesthood involves the superiority of the covenant based upon it. The oath signifies therefore the transition from a provisional and temporary covenant to that which is eternal. <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὅσον</span>. This form of argument is frequent in Philo, see <span class="ital">Quis. Rev. Div. H.</span>, 17, etc. <span class="greekheb">οὐ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας</span>, “not without oath-swearing”; the clause may be completed from that which follows, “has he been made priest,” as in A.V., although Weiss maintains that this is “sprachwidrig” and that the broken clause “kann natürlich nur aus dem Vorigen ergänzt werden”. But it is most natural and grammatical to complete it from the sentence in which it stands: “As not without an oath, so of a better covenant <span class="ital">has Jesus become surety</span>”. The parenthesis thus furnishes the needed ground of this statement. He became surety by becoming priest, and as priest he was constituted with an oath. <span class="greekheb">οἱ μὲν γὰρ</span> “For the one [that is, the Levitical priests] <span class="greekheb">εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς γεγονότες</span> “have been made priests” Vaughan renders “are having become priests—are priests having become so”. So Delitzsch, Weiss and von Soden. Westcott says: “The periphrasis marks the possession as well as the impartment of the office;” and on the “periphrastic conjugation” see Blass, sec. 62; Stephanus Thesaurus <span class="ital">s.v</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰμί</span>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἦσαν γὰρ προεωρακότες</span>.]. <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ μετὰ ὁρκ</span>. “but the other [the new priest] with an oath,” <span class="greekheb">μετὰ</span> of course not being instrumental, but “interposito jurejurando”; where and how this oath is to be found is next explained, it is <span class="greekheb">διὰ f1τοῦ λέγοντος</span> … “through Him that saith to him.

Here already its “betterness” is recognisable in this, that it supersedes the older, and is itself permanent because perfectly accomplishing the purposes of a covenant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">inasmuch as not without an oath</span>] This is the sixth point of superiority. He has lingered at much greater length over the fifth than over the others, from the extreme importance of the argument which it incidentally involved. The oath on which the Melchisedek Priesthood was founded is that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>. The word used for “oath” is not the common word <span class="ital">horkos</span> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm" title="Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:">Hebrews 6:17</a>), but the more sonorous <span class="ital">horkomosia</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-20.htm" title="And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:">Hebrews 7:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καθʼ ὅσον</span>, <span class="ital">inasmuch as</span>) Supply from what follows, <span class="ital">He was made a priest</span>.

The significance of the Divine oath, in connection with the promise to Abraham, has been dwelt on above: the oath of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. is here similarly referred to, as imitating a priesthood that rests on no mere temporary ordinance, but on the immutable Divine counsels.
