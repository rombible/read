That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah - It is well known: it cannot be a matter of dispute. About the fact that the Lord Jesus was of the tribe of Judah, there could be no doubt; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>. But probably the apostle means here to refer to more than that simple fact. It was a doctrine of the Old Testament, and was admitted by the Jews, that the Messiah was to be of that tribe; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-6.htm">Matthew 2:6</a>. This was an additional consideration to show that there was to be a change of some kind in the office of the priesthood, since it was declared (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>) that the Messiah was to be a priest. The fact that the Messiah is to be of the tribe of Judah is still admitted by the Jews. As their distinction of tribes now, however, is broken up, and as it is impossible for them to tell who belongs to the tribe of Judah, it is held by them that when he comes this will be made known by miracle.<p>Of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood - That is, in the Mosaic laws respecting the office of priest, this tribe is not mentioned. All the arrangements pertain to the tribe of Levi. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. evident&#8212;literally, "manifest before the eyes" as a thing indisputable; a proof that whatever difficulties may now appear, then Jesus Christ's genealogy labored under none.<p>our Lord&#8212;the only place where this now common title occurs without "Jesus," or "Christ," except 2Pe 3:15.<p>sprang&#8212;as a plant, and a branch.<p>Judah&#8212;Ge 49:10; Lu 1:27, 39 (Hebron of Judah, where Lightfoot thinks Jesus was conceived) Lu 2:4, 5; Re 5:5.<p>of which tribe &#8230; priesthood&#8212;"in respect to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests" (so the oldest manuscripts read, nothing to imply that priests were to be taken from it).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; </span> the proof of this change of the tribe, and of what tribe he was, was undeniably evident to these Hebrews from their own genealogies, and the Roman census and enrolment of him; the providence of God ordering this, that it might be universally known that he was David’s seed, as well as Abraham’s, and as called by his name, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23</a>,24 37:24,25</span>.
