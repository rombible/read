Melchizedek has blessed Abraham; but certainly (in every such act of blessing as is here contemplated) it is the less that is blessed by the greater. The conclusion, that Melchizedek in this act appears as Abraham’s superior, it did not seem necessary to express.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:4-10 That High Priest who should afterward appear, of whom Melchizedec was a type, must be much superior to the Levitical priests. Observe Abraham's great dignity and happiness; that he had the promises. That man is rich and happy indeed, who has the promises, both of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. This honour have all those who receive the Lord Jesus. Let us go forth in our spiritual conflicts, trusting in his word and strength, ascribing our victories to his grace, and desiring to be met and blessed by him in all our ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And without all contradiction - It is an admitted principle; a point about which there can be no dispute.<p>The less is blessed of the better - The act of pronouncing a blessing is understood to imply superiority of rank, age, or station. So when a father lays his hand on his children and blesses them, it is understood to be the act of one superior in age, venerableness, and authority; when a prophet pronounced a blessing on the people, the same thing was understood, and the same is true also when a minister of religion pronounces a blessing on a congregation. It is the act of one who is understood to sustain an office above the people on whom the blessing is pronounced. This was understood of the Saviour when parents brought their children to him to lay his hands on them and bless them <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13</a>; and the same was true of Jacob when dying he blessed the sons of Joseph; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5-20</a>. The word "less" here means the one of inferior rank; who is less in office, honor, or age. It does not imply inferiority of moral or religious character, for this is not the point under consideration. The word "better" means one who is of superior office or rank, not one who has necessarily a purer or holier character. That Melchizedek was thus superior to Abraham, Paul says, is implied by the very declaration that he "blessed him." It is also seen to be true by the whole comparison. Abraham was a petty prince; an "Emir" - the head of a company of Nomades, or migratory shepherds, having, it is true, a large number of dependants, but still not having the rank here given to Melchizedek. Though called "a prophet" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>, yet he is nowhere called either a priest or a king. In these respects, it was undoubted that he was inferior to Melchizedek. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. The principle that the blesser is superior to him whom he blesses, holds good only in a blessing given with divine authority; not merely a prayerful wish, but one that is divinely efficient in working its purport, as that of the patriarchs on their children: so Christ's blessing, Lu 24:51; Ac 3:26.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This principle is commonly acknowledged, it is a most apparent truth, you Hebrews cannot deny it; it is your common judgment, that a priest blessing, as God’s officer, is greater than those blessed by him. He that is in a lower state in God’s church, is blessed by one set above him in office by God himself, better and greater than he for his place and dignity in office. He must have the pre-eminency for his blessing, which he authoritatively, powerfully, and effectually conveyeth from God to those he blesseth, representing therein God communicating by him the good he wanteth in his benediction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hebrews/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the greater. This is a self-evident truth, and is undeniable; it admits of no controversy, and cannot be gainsaid, that he that blesseth is greater in that respect than he that is blessed by him; as the priests were greater in their office than the people who were blessed by them; and so Melchizedek, as a priest of the most high God, and as blessing Abraham, was greater than he; and so must be greater than the Levites, who sprung from him; and his priesthood be more excellent than theirs; and consequently Christ, his antitype, and who was of his order, must be greater too; which is the design of the apostle throughout the whole of his reasoning. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</span><p>(c) He speaks of the public blessing which the priests used.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-7.htm" title="And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.">Hebrews 7:7</a> joined on by means of <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, since the verse contains the major of a syllogism.

For Melchisedec as the priest of God was the representative of God, or one divinely commissioned, in the communicating of the blessings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/hebrews/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-7.htm" title="And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.">Hebrews 7:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς δὲ πάσης ἀντιλογίας</span> … <span class="greekheb">εὐλογεῖται</span>. “And without any dispute the less is blessed of the greater.” Therefore, Abraham is the less, and Melchizedek the greater. The principle [expressed in its widest form by the neuter] applies where the blessing carries with it not only the verbal expression of goodwill, but goodwill achieving actual results. But man blesses God in the sense of praising Him, or desiring that all praise may be His.
