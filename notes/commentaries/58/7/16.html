As such, it is bound up with distinctions of race and tribe and family; it is limited by human infirmity and the changes wrought by sickness and death; what it accomplishes is the purifying of the flesh; in its own nature it is temporary, and may be set aside.

That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is made - That is, the other priest is made, to wit, the Messiah. He was made a priest by a special law.<p>Not after the law of a carnal commandment - Not according to the Law of a commandment pertaining to the flesh. The word "carnal" means "fleshly;" and the idea is, that the Law under which the priests of the old dispensation were made was external, rather than spiritual; it related more to outward observances than to the keeping of the heart. That this was the nature of the Mosaic ritual in the main, it was impossible to doubt, and the apostle proceeds to argue from this undeniable truth.<p>But after the power of an endless life - By an authority of endless duration. That is, it was not concerned mainly with outward observances, and did not pass over from one to another by death, but was unchanging in its character, and spiritual in its nature. It was enduring and perpetual as a priesthood, and was thus far exalted above the service performed by the priests under the former dispensation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. carnal &#8230; endless&#8212;mutually contrasted. As "form" and "power" are opposed, 2Ti 3:5; so here "the law" and "power," compare Ro 8:3, "The law was weak through the flesh"; and Heb 7:18, "weakness." "The law" is here not the law in general, but the statute as to the priesthood. "Carnal," as being only outward and temporary, is contrasted with "endless," or, as Greek, "indissoluble." Commandments is contrasted with "life." The law can give a commandment, but it cannot give life (Heb 7:19). But our High Priest's inherent "power," now in heaven, has in Him "life for ever"; Heb 9:14, "through the eternal Spirit"; Heb 7:25, "able &#8230; ever liveth" (Joh 5:26).

This relative clause defines the “likeness to Melchizedek,” and brings out a double contrast between the new priest and the Levitical—the Levitical priesthood is <span class="greekheb">κατὰ νόμον</span>, the other <span class="greekheb">κατὰ δύναμιν</span>, the one is dependent on what is <span class="greekheb">σαρκίνη</span>, the other on what belongs to <span class="greekheb">ζωὴ ἀκατάλυτος</span>. These contrasts are significant. The Levitical priesthood rested on law, on a regulation that those should be priests who were born of certain parents. This was an outward <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span>, a thing outside of the men themselves, and moreover it was a <span class="greekheb">νόμος σαρκίνης ἐντολῆς</span>, regulating the priesthood not in relation to spiritual fitness but in accordance with fleshly descent. No matter what the man’s nature is nor how ill-suited and reluctant he is to the office, he becomes a priest because his fleshly pedigree is right. The new priest on the contrary did what He did, not because any official necessity was laid upon Him, but because there was a power in His own nature compelling and enabling Him, the power of a life which death did not dissolve. The contrast is between the official and the personal or real. All that is merely professional must be dispossessed by what is real. Hereditary kings gave way to Cromwell. The Marshals of France put their batons in their pockets when Joan of Arc appeared. For the difference between <span class="greekheb">σάρκινος</span> and <span class="greekheb">σαρκικός</span> see Trench, <span class="ital">Synonyms</span>, 257, who quotes the reason assigned by Erasmus for the use of the former in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>, “ut materiam intelligas, non qualitatem”. The enactment was <span class="greekheb">σαρκίνη</span> inasmuch as it took to do only with the flesh. It caused the priesthood to be implicated with and dependent on fleshly descent. Opposed to this was the inherent energy and potentiality of an indissoluble or indestructible life. The life of the new priest is indissoluble, not as eternally existing in the Son, but as existing in Him Incarnate and fulfilling priestly functions. The term itself “indestructible” used in place of “eternal,” directs the thought to the death of Jesus which might naturally seem to have threatened it with destruction. His survival of death was needful to the fulfilment of His functions as priest (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The meaning and reference of the term is brought out by the contrast of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-28.htm" title="For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for ever more.">Hebrews 7:28</a> between “men who have weakness” and <span class="greekheb">υἰὸν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τετελειωμένον</span>. “Unquestionably that which enables the Son to be Messianic King and High Priest of men is His rank as Son. But it is true on the other hand that it is as Son come in the flesh that He is King and Priest. And the expression ‘hath become priest’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>) points to a historical event. It is, therefore, probable that indissoluble life is attributed to Him not in general as the eternal Son, but as the Son made man.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">is made</span>] Lit., “is become.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after the law of a carnal commandment</span>] Rather, “in accordance with <span class="ital">the law of a fleshen</span> (i.e. earthly) <span class="ital">commandment</span>.” Neither this writer, nor even St Paul, ever called or would have called the Law “carnal” (<span class="ital">sarkikos</span>), a term which St Paul implicitly disclaims when he says that the Law is “spiritual” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a>); but to call it “fleshen” (<span class="ital">sarkinos</span>) is merely to say that it is hedged round with earthly limitations and relationships, and therefore unfit to be adapted to eternal conditions.

An attentive reader will see that even in the closest apparent resemblances to the language of St Paul there are differences in this Epistle. For instance his relative disparagement of the Law turns almost exclusively on the conditions of its <span class="ital">hierarchy;</span> and his use of the word “flesh” and “fleshen,” refers not to sensual passions but to mortality and transience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of an endless life</span>] Lit., “of an indissoluble life,” the life of a tabernacle which “could not be dissolved.” The word (<span class="ital">akatalutos</span>) is not found elsewhere in the N.T.
