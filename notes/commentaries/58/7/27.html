(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-3.htm" title="And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.">Hebrews 5:3</a>.) The <span class= "ital">annual</span> recurrence of that day is distinctly referred to more than once in this Epistle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm" title="But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.">Hebrews 10:3</a>): hence the words now before us, which seem to imply <span class= "ital">daily</span> sacrifices thus offered by the high priests, have given rise to much discussion. Neither the morning and evening sacrifices nor the daily meat-offering of the high priest could have been spoken of in the terms here used, which in their natural meaning suit the ritual of the Day of Atonement, and that alone. It is true—and passages of Philo and the Talmud are appositely quoted to illustrate the fact—that, as the high priest was represented by all other priests, their actions were counted as his; but it seems impossible to think that the words have no more significance than this. Either we must take “daily” as equivalent to “day by day” (as the Jews were accustomed to speak of the Day of Atonement as “the day”),—which will give us the meaning, “on each recurrence of this sacred day;” or we must connect the word, not with the Jewish high priests, but with Jesus alone. The order of the Greek would of itself suggest this latter arrangement of the words. If it is correct, the choice of the word “daily” presents but little difficulty. There could be no question of <span class= "ital">years</span> in regard to the ministration of the Lord Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary; and “daily” was perhaps the most natural word in such a case, when the frequently stated repetition of a sacrifice was the thought to be expressed.<p><span class= "bld">For this he did once.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">once for all.</span> These words and those that follow, “when He offered up Himself,” are best understood as a parenthesis. The truth stated in the former part of the verse, that Jesus needeth not, like the high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then “for those of the people,” finds its explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-28.htm" title="For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for ever more.">Hebrews 7:28</a>, “For the Law,” &c. But, having introduced the thought of a sacrifice for the sins of the people—a thought not yet expressly mentioned in any part of the Epistle in connection with Jesus, though virtually presented, as we have seen, in many earlier words—the writer will not pass on without the most emphatic statement that such a sacrifice was offered, once for all, in the sacrifice of Himself.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:26-28 Observe the description of the personal holiness of Christ. He is free from all habits or principles of sin, not having the least disposition to it in his nature. No sin dwells in him, not the least sinful inclination, though such dwells in the best of Christians. He is harmless, free from all actual transgression; he did no violence, nor was there any deceit in his mouth. He is undefiled. It is hard to keep ourselves pure, so as not to partake the guilt of other men's sins. But none need be dismayed who come to God in the name of his beloved Son. Let them be assured that he will deliver them in the time of trial and suffering, in the time of prosperity, in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests - As the Jewish priests. This is an additional circumstance introduced to show the superior excellency of the High Priest of the Christian profession, and to show also how he was suited to our wants. The Jewish high priest was a sinful man. He had the same fallen and corrupt nature as others. He needed an expiatory sacrifice for his own sins as really as they did for theirs. When he approached God to offer sacrifice, it was needful to make an atonement for himself, and when all was done it was still a sacrifice offered by a sinful man. But it was not so in the case of Jesus. He was so holy that he needed no sacrifice for himself, and all that he did was in behalf of others. Besides, it was necessary that the sacrifices in the Jewish service should be constantly repeated. They were imperfect. They were mere types and shadows. They who offered them were frail, sinful men. It became necessary, therefore, to repeat them every day to keep up the proper sense of their transgressions, and to furnish a suitable acknowledgment of the tendency to sin alike among the people and the priests. Neither in the nature of the offering, nor in the character of those who made it, was there any sufficient reason why it should cease to be offered, and it was therefore repeated day by day. But it was not so with the Lord Jesus. The offering which he made, though presented but once, was so ample and perfect that it had sufficient merit for all the sins of the world, and needed never to be repeated. It is not probable that the Jewish high priest himself personally officiated at the offering of sacrifice every day; but the meaning here is, that it was done daily, and that there was need of a daily sacrifice in his behalf. As one of the Jewish people, the sacrifice was offered on his account as well as on the account of others - for he partook of the common infirmities and sinfulness of the nation.<p>For this he did once - That is, once for all - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;  ephapax. He made such an atonement that it was not needful that it should be repeated. Thus, he put an end to sacrifice, for when he made the great atonement it was complete, and there was no need that any more blood should be shed for human guilt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. daily&#8212;"day by day." The priests daily offered sacrifices (Heb 9:6; 10:11; Ex 29:38-42). The high priests took part in these daily-offered sacrifices only on festival days; but as they represented the whole priesthood, the daily offerings are here attributed to them; their exclusive function was to offer the atonement "once every year" (Heb 9:7), and "year by year continually" (Heb 10:1). The "daily" strictly belongs to Christ, not to the high priests, "who needeth not daily, as those high priests (year by year, and their subordinate priests daily), to offer," &c.<p>offer up&#8212;The Greek term is peculiarly used of sacrifices for sin. The high priest's double offering on the day of atonement, the bullock for himself, and the goat for the people's sins, had its counterpart in the TWO lambs offered daily by the ordinary priests.<p>this he did&#8212;not "died first for His own sins and then the people's," but for the people's only. The negation is twofold: He needeth not to offer (1) daily; nor (2) to offer for His own sins also; for He offered Himself a spotless sacrifice (Heb 7:26; Heb 4:15). The sinless alone could offer for the sinful.<p>once&#8212;rather as Greek, "once for all." The sufficiency of the one sacrifice to atone for all sins for ever, resulted from its absolute spotlessness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In this verse the Spirit shows the ground of his intercession work in heaven, and why he doth not sacrifice as a High Priest there; therein setting his far above the Aaronical priesthood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice; </span> he had no necessity, being so holy as he was, to multiply sacrifices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">First for his own sins, and then for the people’s; </span> for himself, being sinless, and having no infirmity to atone for, as the Aaronical priesthood had, who annually on the day of atonement did offer sacrifice for themselves, being sinners, and needing pardon as well as the people, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-7.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make an atonement for yourself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.">Leviticus 9:7</a></span>.

In the <span class="greekheb">πρότερον ὑπὲρ τῶν ἰδίων ἁμαρτιῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔπειτα τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ</span> there is an apparent allusion to the sacrifice of the high priest on the great day of atonement (Leviticus 16.), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm" title="But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:">Hebrews 9:7</a>.

For <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμέραν</span> can signify nothing else than “daily” or “day by day.” To foist upon it the signification: “yearly on a definite day” (“<span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμέραν ὡρισμένην</span> or <span class="greekheb">τεταγμένην</span>”), with Schlichting (secundum diem, nempe statam ac definitam, in anniversario illo videlicet sacrificio), Piscator, Starck, Peirce, Chr. Fr. Schmid, M‘Lean, Storr, and others; or to take it in the attenuated sense, as equivalent to “saepissime, quoties res fert” (Grotius, Owen), or “<span class="greekheb">πολλάκις</span>” (Böhme, Stein), or “<span class="greekheb">διὰ παντός</span>” (de Wette), or in the sense of “one day after another” (Ebrard, who supposes the author is overlooking a succession of centuries, and so a succession of days present themselves to his eye, in which the high priest again and again offers a sacrifice!), is linguistically unwarranted. In like manner it is a mere subterfuge and arbitrary misinterpreting of the words, when Delitzsch, Riehm (<span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 438), and Alford, concurring in the suggestion of Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 404 f., 2 Aufl.), seek to put into them the sense: that Christ needeth not to do daily that which the high priests do once every year, but which He—if He is to be a constant mediator of an all-embracing expiation of sin—must needs do day by day. For all that is expressed is the fact that Christ needs not to do daily that which the Levitical high priests need to do daily.[84] Nor does it avail anything that Kurtz will take <span class="greekheb">καθʼ <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΈΡΑΝ</span></span></span> in conjunction only with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἜΧΕΙ ἈΝΆΓΚΗΝ</span></span></span>, since these words do not occupy an independent position alone, and only acquire their more precise definition by that which follows. For that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘʼ ἩΜΈΡΑΝ</span></span></span> has “nothing whatever to do with the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΥΣΊΑς ἈΝΑΦΈΡΕΙΝ</span></span></span>,” is a mere assertion on the part of Kurtz; and his contention, that only the “daily renewal and daily pressing necessity,” of the O. T. high priest on account of his daily sinning, the necessity, “ere (on the great day of propitiation) he could offer for the sin of the whole people, of first presenting a sacrifice for his own sins,” was to be brought into relief, is a violent perversion of the words,—admitting as they do of no misapprehension,—from which even the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΌΤΕΡΟΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἜΠΕΙΤΑ</span></span></span>, expressive of a relation of <span class="ital">parity</span>, ought to have kept him; in place of which, in order to bring out the subsidiary character of the one half of the statement, <span class="greekheb">πρὸ τοῦ</span> with the infinitive, or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΊΝ</span></span></span> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῚΝ Ἤ</span></span></span>), must have been written. We have therefore to conclude, with Gerhard, Calov, Seb. Schmidt, Braun, Wolf, Carpzov, Bleek, and Tholuck, that the author had present to his mind, besides the principal sacrifice on the great day of atonement, at the same time the ordinary daily sacrifice of the Levitical priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually....">Exodus 29:38-42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/28-3.htm" title="And you shall say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering....">Numbers 28:3-8</a>), and by reason of an inexact mode of expression blended the two together; to which he might the more easily be led, in that, according to Josephus, the high priest—not indeed always, but yet on the Sabbaths, new moons, and other festivals (according to the Mishna tr. <span class="ital">Tamith</span>, vii. 3 : in general as often as he was so minded)—went up with the other priests into the temple, and took part in the sacrificial service. Comp. Josephus, <span class="ital">de Bello Judaico</span>, v. 5. 7 : <span class="greekheb">Ὁ δὲ ἀρχιερεὺς ἀνῄει μὲν σὺν αὐτοῖς ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἀεί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ταῖς δʼ ἑβδομάσι καὶ νουμηνίαις</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἴ τις ἑορτὴ πάτριος ἢ πανήγυρις πάνδημος ἀγομένη διʼ ἔτους</span>. To be compared also are the words of Philo, who, <span class="ital">Quis rer. divin. haer</span>. p. 505 A (with Mangey, I. p. 497), remarks that in the daily sacrifice the priests offered the oblation for themselves, but the lambs for the people (<span class="greekheb">Ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς ἐνδελεχεῖς θυσίας ὁρᾷς εἰς ἴσα διῃρημένας</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἥν τε ὑπὲρ αὑτῶν ἀνάγουσιν οἱ ἱερεῖς διὰ τῆς σεμιδάλεως καὶ τὴν ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἔθνους τῶν δυοῖν ἀμνῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὓς ἀναφέρειν <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΕΊΡΗΤΑΙ</span></span></span>), and <span class="ital">de Speciall. Legg</span>. p. 797 E (with Mangey, II. p. 321), equally as our passage, ascribes to the high priest the offering of a daily sacrifice (<span class="greekheb">οὕτω τοῦ σύμπαντος ἔθνους συγγενὴς καὶ ἀγχιστεὺς κοινὸς ὁ ἀρχιερεύς ἐστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρυτανεύων μὲν τὰ δίκαια τοῖς ἀμφισβητοῦσι κατὰ τοὺς νόμους</span>, <span class="greekheb">εὐχὰς δὲ καὶ θυσίας τελῶν καθʼ ἐκάστην ἡμέραν</span>).

It appears however that the High Priest might if he chose take actual part in the daily offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.">Exodus 29:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-44.htm" title="And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 29:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/6-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Leviticus 6:19-22</a>; Jos. <span class="ital">B.

It is true that the daily sacrifices and Mincha or “meat offering” had no recorded connexion with any <span class="ital">expiatory</span> sacrifices; but an expiatory significance seems to have been attached to the daily offering of incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:...">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>, LXX.; Yoma, f. 44. 1). The notion that there is any reference to the Jewish Temple built by Onias at Leontopolis is entirely baseless. Both Philo (<span class="ital">De Spec. Legg.</span> § 53) and the Talmud use the very same expression as the writer, who seems to have been perfectly well aware that, normally and strictly, the High Priest only offered sacrifices on one day in the year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm" title="But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.">Hebrews 10:3</a>).

Not <span class="ital">daily</span>, for He has done that <span class="ital">once for all</span>. Not for <span class="ital">His own</span> sins, for He offered Himself, a holy sacrifice. There is besides in it an inverted Chiasmus. The first follows from the second, the second is confirmed by the 28th verse. Often in Scripture two positions (theses) are laid down, and are proved by the <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>, twice following them.—<span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμέραν</span>, <span class="ital">daily</span>) <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐνιαυτὸν</span>, <span class="ital">year by year</span>, properly, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm" title="But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.">Hebrews 10:3</a>.

The reference throughout what follows being to the high priest's peculiar functions on the Day of Atonement, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> might have been expected. There are two tenable solutions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the daily offerings of the priests are regarded as made by the high priest, who represented the whole priesthood, on the principle, <span class="accented">qui facit per altos tacit per se</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (as is suggested by its position in the sentence) belongs not to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, but only to Christ: "<span class="accented">who</span> <span class="accented">has no need daily, as the high priests have yearly</span>:" for <span class="accented">his</span> intercession being perpetual, an offering on his part would be needed daily, if needed at all. This view is supported by the fact that the <span class="accented">daily</span> sacrifices are not spoken of in the Law as including a special one in the first place for the priest's own sin. "This he did." Did what? Offer for his own sins as well as for the people's? No; for, though it has been seen above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) how the high priest's offering for himself might have its counterpart in the agony, the Sinless One cannot be said to have offered for sins of his own. And, besides, he having offered <span class="accented">himself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), the offering could not be <span class="accented">for</span> himself. We must, therefore, take "this he did" as referring only to the latter part of the preceding clause, while <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> answers to the former part; or as implying generally, "did all that was needed for atonement." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who needeth not daily (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;' &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Apparently inconsistent with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a> : but the sense is, "who hath no need day by day as the high priest had (year by year) to offer sacrifices," etc. The great point is repetition, whether daily or yearly.<p>Once (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;)<p>Rend. once for all.
