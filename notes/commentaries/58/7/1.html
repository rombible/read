Of Melchizedek we know nothing beyond what we learn from the brief narrative of Genesis 14. A Jewish legend, preserved in the later Targums on the Pentateuch, but not in the Targum of Onkelos, identifies him with the patriarch Shem; and many conjectures of a later date (stimulated by the remarkable language of these verses) have been far wilder in their extravagance. It may be that the result of these speculations has been to invest this chapter with a mystery which does not belong to it. The object of the writer is, in reality, very simple—to deal with the question, What is the import of the divine utterance that David’s Lord is a “Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek”? Not to take up the history of Melchizedek and allegorise each part, but to point out the full meaning of the comparison made in the prophecy, which declares the priesthood of the future King to be “after the order of Melchizedek—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to be such as the priesthood of Melchizedek typically set forth. The first part of this sentence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1-2</a>, as far as “. . . tenth part of all”) enumerates the known facts of the history of Melchizedek; the following clauses are occupied with the interpretation of the history, and with inferences from it. Of the facts recorded in Genesis none are passed over, except the gift of bread and wine; the blessing also is mentioned in general terms only. The language of the LXX. is, as a rule, closely followed throughout.<p><span class= "bld">King of Salem.</span>—Jewish tradition affirms strongly that this Salem occupied the site on which Jerusalem afterwards stood; and certainly Salem is a poetic name of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm" title="In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.">Psalm 76:2</a>). This tradition, found in Josephus and in the earliest of the Targums, agrees well with the circumstances of the narrative as far as we can follow them, and seems to deserve acceptance. Jerome maintained that Salem was situated near Scythopolis, where in his day were pointed out ruins of “Melchizedek’s palace.” Another tradition (probably of Samaritan origin) makes Mount Gerizim the place of meeting, in which case the city of Melchizedek would probably be near Shechem.<p><span class= "bld">The most high God.</span>—A title characteristic of the narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>). Melchizedek is the first who in Scripture is spoken of as priest, and the name is given without explanation. As in the earliest times this office was held by the head of a family (Job 1), it is not remarkable to find a union of regal and sacerdotal functions in the same man.<p><span class= "bld">Returning from the slaughter.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">from the smiting, </span>or <span class= "ital">defeat.</span> According to the narrative in Genesis the meeting took place “after Abraham had returned” from the defeat of the king; but probably the meaning does not differ from that here given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">For, </span>&c. — The apostle having promised to lead the believing Hebrews forward to the perfection of Christian knowledge, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,...">Hebrews 6:1-4</a>,) particularly with regard to the high-priesthood of Christ as typified by that of Melchisedec, which he had repeatedly mentioned, (namely, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-6.htm" title="As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-10.htm" title="Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>,) as a figure of it he proceeds now to fulfil his promise; and, in order thereto, points out the deep meaning of the oath recorded <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>. And by accurately examining the particulars concerning Melchisedec, related in the Mosaic history, he shows that Melchisedec was a far more excellent priest than Aaron and all his sons, and consequently that Jesus, whom God had made <span class="ital">a High-Priest for ever after the similitude of Melchisedec, </span>exercised a priesthood both more acceptable to God, and more effectual for procuring the pardon of sin, than the priesthood which the sons of Aaron exercised under the law. For the design of the apostle in this chapter is not to declare the <span class="ital">nature </span>or the <span class="ital">exercise </span>of the priesthood of Christ, though occasionally mentioned; having spoken of the former, chap. 5., and intending to treat of the latter at large afterward, which he does chap. 9. But it is of its <span class="ital">excellence </span>and <span class="ital">dignity </span>that he discourses here, and yet not absolutely, but in comparison with the Levitical priesthood, which method was both necessary, and directly conducive to his end. For if the priesthood of Christ were not so excellent as that of Aaron, it was to no purpose to persuade them to embrace the former, and reject the latter. This, therefore, he designs to prove upon principles avowed among themselves, by arguments taken from what had been received and acknowledged in the Jewish Church from the first foundation of it. To this end he shows, that antecedently to the giving of the law, and the institution of the Levitical priesthood, God had, without any respect thereto, given a typical prefiguration of this priesthood of Christ, in one who was on all accounts superior to the future Levitical priests. This sacred truth, which had been hid for so many ages in the church, and which undeniably manifests the certain future introduction of another and better priesthood, is here brought to light by the apostle and improved. <span class="ital">For this Melchisedec </span>— Of whom Moses speaks, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18</a>, &c., (the passage to which David refers,) was <span class="ital">king of Salem </span>— “According to Josephus, (<span class="ital">Antiq. </span>lib. 1. cap. 11,) <span class="ital">Salem, </span>the city of Melchisedec, was Jerusalem. But according to Jerome, who says he received his information from some learned Jews, it was the town which is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.">Genesis 33:18</a>, as a city of Shechem, and which is spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-23.htm" title="And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.">John 3:23</a>) as near to Enon, where John baptized. This city being in Abraham’s way, as he returned from Damascus to Sodom, after <span class="ital">the slaughter of the kings, </span>many are of Jerome’s opinion, that the northern <span class="ital">Salem </span>was Melchisedec’s city rather than Jerusalem, which was situated farther to the south.” <span class="ital">Priest of the most high God </span>— This title given him by Moses, and here taken notice of by the apostle, implies that he had been appointed to that office in a solemn and public manner; and, of consequence, “that there was a priest divinely appointed to officiate for the worshippers of the true God in Canaan, long before the days of Aaron, and before God formed to himself a visible church from any particular family or nation of mankind. The Hebrew word, indeed, translated <span class="ital">a priest, </span>sometimes signifies <span class="ital">a prince, </span>but the historian hath removed the ambiguity by adding the words, <span class="ital">of the most high God.” Who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings </span>— Who had taken Lot prisoner, with the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, and the neighbouring cities of the plain; <span class="ital">and blessed him </span>— Pronounced on him a blessing in the name of God, to whom he ministered; and in his manner of blessing him showed himself to be a priest of the only true God, his words being, <span class="ital">Blessed be Abraham of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-3 Melchizedec met Abraham when returning from the rescue of Lot. His name, King of Righteousness, doubtless suitable to his character, marked him as a type of the Messiah and his kingdom. The name of his city signified Peace; and as king of peace he typified Christ, the Prince of Peace, the great Reconciler of God and man. Nothing is recorded as to the beginning or end of his life; thus he typically resembled the Son of God, whose existence is from everlasting to everlasting, who had no one that was before him, and will have no one come after him, in his priesthood. Every part of Scripture honours the great King of Righteousness and Peace, our glorious High Priest and Saviour; and the more we examine it, the more we shall be convinced, that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this Melchisedek; - compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6</a>. The name Melchizedek, from which the apostle derives a portion of his argument here, is Hebrew, &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;  Malkiy-Tsedeq, and is correctly explained as meaning "king of righteousness" - being compounded of two words - "king and righteousness." Why this name was given to this man is unknown. Names, however, were frequently given on account of some quality or characteristic of the man: see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>. This name may have been given on account of his eminent integrity. The apostle calls attention to it <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-2.htm">Hebrews 7:2</a> as a circumstance worthy of notice, that his name, and the name of the city where he reigned, were so appropriate to one who, as a priest, was the predecessor of the Messiah. The account of Melchizedek, which is very brief, occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>. The name occurs in the Bible only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, and in this Epistle. Nothing else is certainly known of him.<p>Grotius supposes that he is the same man who in the history of Sanchoniathon is called &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;  Suduk. It has indeed been made a question by some whether such a person ever actually existed, and consequently whether this be a proper name. But the account in Genesis is as simple a historical record as any other in the Bible. In that account there is no difficulty whatever. It is said simply that when Abraham was returning from a successful military expedition, this man, who it seems was well known, and who was respected as a priest of God, came out to express his approbation of what he had done, and to refresh him with bread and wine. As a tribute of gratitude to him, and as a thank-offering to God, Abraham gave him a tenth part of the spoils which he had taken. Such an occurrence was by no means improbable, nor would it have been attended with any special difficulty if it had not been for the use which the apostle makes of it in this Epistle. Yet on no subject has there been a greater variety of opinion than in regard to this man.<p>The bare recital of the opinions which have been entertained of him would fill a volume. But in a case which "seems" to be plain from the Scripture narrative, it is not necessary even to enumerate these opinions. They only serve to show how easy it is for people to mystify a clear statement of history, and how fond they are of finding what is mysterious and marvelous in the plainest narrative of facts. That he was Shem, as the Jews suppose, or that he was the Son of God himself, as many Christian expositors have maintained, there is not the slightest evidence. That the latter opinion is false is perfectly clear - for if he were the Son of God, with what propriety could the apostle say that he "was made like the Son of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a>; that is, like himself; or that Christ was constituted a priest "after the order of Melchisedek;" that is, that he was a type of himself? The most simple and probable opinion is that given by Josephus, that he was a pious Canaanitish prince; a personage eminently endowed by God, and who acted as the priest of his people.<p>That he combined in himself the offices of priest and king, furnished to the apostle a beautiful illustration of the offices sustained by the Redeemer, and was in this respect, perhaps, the only one whose history is recorded in the Old Testament, who would furnish such an illustration. That his genealogy was not recorded, while that of every other priest mentioned was so carefully traced and preserved, furnished another striking illustration. In this respect, like the Son of God, he stood alone. He was not in a "line" of priests; he was preceded by no one in the sacerdotal office, nor was he followed by any. That he was superior to Abraham. and consequently to all who descended from Abraham; that a tribute was rendered to him by the great Ancestor of all the fraternity of Jewish priests was just an illustration which suited the purpose of Paul. His name, therefore, the place where he reigned, his solitariness, his lone conspicuity in all the past, his dignity, and perhaps the air of mystery thrown over him in the brief history in Genesis, furnished a beautiful and striking illustration of the solitary grandeur, and the inapproachable eminence of the priesthood of the Son of God. There is no evidence that Melchizedek was "designed" to be a type of the Messiah, or that Abraham so understood it, Nothing of this kind is affirmed; and how shall "we" affirm it when the sacred oracles are silent?<p>(Doubtless great care and sobriety are requisite in the interpretation of types, and we admire the caution that, in every instance, demands the authority of Scripture, expressed or distinctly implied. From want of this caution, the greatest extravagancies have been committed, the most fanciful analogies established, where none were intended, and every minute circumstance in the Old Testament exalted into a type of something in the New. The very boards and nails of the tabernacle of Moses have been thus exalted.<p>Yet in our just aversion to one extreme, it is possible we may run into another. Of the typical character of Melchizedek, we had thought no doubt could be entertained. The canon of typical interpretation, indeed, demands, that in order to constitute the relation between type and antitype, there be, in addition to mere resemblance, "precious design," and "pre-ordained connection." And the commentary affirms, that "there is no evidence, that Melchizedek was designed to be a type of the Messiah, or that Abraham so understood it." Let it be observed in reply, that in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> Psalm the typical character of Melchizedek "seems" expressly acknowledged. It may be alleged, that the prophet simply states resemblance, without affirming that such resemblance was designed or intended. But that a prophet should be commissioned to declare, that Christ's priesthood should be "after such an order," and yet that in the institution of that exalted order there should have been no designed reference to Christ, is improbable.<p>The prediction seems to involve the original design. And this order of priesthood, too, is far superior to that of Aaron, the typical character of which is admitted. Moreover, the last clause of verse third, in this chapter, according to our English translation as a designed connection. Melchizedek was "made like unto the Son of God." The translation is accurate. &#x391;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Aphomoio&#772;menos, according to Parkhurst, is "made very like." So also Scott: "The composition is probably intended to add energy; made very like." And Bloomfield adopts, "being made by the divine decree a type of that great High Priest, who, &amp;c,;" see the notes in Greek Testament. Lastly, on any other principle than that of "designed" typical relation, it is difficult, if not impossible, to give any just account of the remarkable omissions, the apparently studied silence, in the history of Melchizedek, in regard to those things that are commonly related in notices of lives, however brief.<p>He is introduced to us with an air of impenetrable mystery. He appears on the stage as Priest of the most High God, and then disappears, leaving us in complete darkness concerning his birth, parentage, and death. "In all these respects," says Mr. Scott, "the silence of the Scripture is intentional and refers to the great antitype." Melchizedek, therefore, we may remark, seems not only to have been designed as a type, but "special care" has been taken, that the record of him should be in all things suited to that design. That the apostle lighted on a happy coincidence, deserving of a passing thought, is not probable, whether this remark be meant to apply to the name, or to other particulars in this remarkable story. Indeed, divest it of its designed typical character, and the grandeur of the passage vanishes. A simple resemblance has been discovered between Christ and a certain character in the old Testament. This is all the apostle means to affirm! And for this too, he introduces Melchizedek, with such wondrous caution in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11</a>; "Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, but ye are dull of hearing." What was hard to be uttered, or difficult to be comprehended about a mere "illustration," or "resemblance?"<p>The following remarks of Owen are pertinent and beautiful. "The true cause of all these omissions was the same with that of the institution of his (Melchizedek's) priesthood, and the introduction of his person into the story. And this was, that he might he the more express and signal representative of the Lord Christ in his priesthood. And we may herein consider the sovereign wisdom of the Holy Spirit in bringing forth truth unto light, according as the state and condition of the church doth require. And first he prophesieth only a naked story of a person that was a type of Christ. Something the people of the age wherein he lived, might learn by his ministrations, but not much. For what was principally instructive in him, for the use of the church, was not of force until all his circumstances were forgotten. Yea, the contrivance of any tradition concerning his parents, birth, and death, had been contrary to the mind of God, and what instruction he intended the church by him.<p>Afterward, when, it may be, all thoughts of any use or design in this story were lost, and the church was fully satisfied in a priesthood quite of another nature, the Holy Spirit in one word of prophecy instructs her, not only that the things spoken concerning Melchizedek were not so recorded for his own sake, or on his own account, but with respect to another priest, which was afterward to arise, by him represented. This gave a new consideration to the whole story; but moreover gave the church to know, that the priesthood, which it then had, was not always to continue, but that one of another nature was to be introduced, as was signified long before the institution of that priesthood which they enjoyed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>. Yet the church was left greatly in the dark, and, at the coming of our Saviour, had utterly lost all knowledge of the mystery of the type, and the promise renewed in the Psalm. Wherefore, our apostle entering on the unfolding of this mystery, doth not only preface it with an assertion of its difficulty, but also by a long previous discourse, variously prepareth their minds to a most diligent attention."<p>The excellence of this quotation will, in the reader's estimation, excuse the length of it. On the whole, he who reflects how all things in the ancient economy were ordered of God, and how great a part of that economy was meant to adumbrate the realities of the gospel, while he will be cautious in admitting typical analogies of a doubtful kind, will be slow to believe that the resemblance between Christ's priesthood, and that of the "most" exalted order previously instituted, is casual, or undesigned - slow to believe, that the apostle would make so large use of such accidental analogy, and found on it an argument so great.)<p>King of Salem - Such is the record in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>. The word "Salem" - &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;  shale&#772;m - means "peace;" and from this fact the apostle derives his illustration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-2.htm">Hebrews 7:2</a>. He regards it as a fact worth remarking on, that the "name" of the place over which he ruled expressed so strikingly the nature of the kingdom over which the Messiah was placed. In regard to the "place" here denoted by the name "Salem," the almost uniform opinion has been that it was that afterward known as Jerusalem. The reasons for this opinion are,<p>(1) that it is a part of the name Jerusalem itself - the name "Jerus," altered from "Jebus," having been afterward added, because it was the residence of the "Jebusites."<p>(2) the name "Salem" is itself given to Jerusalem; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>, "In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Heb 7:1-28.

This title of God, "the Most High," handed down by tradition from the primitive revelation, appears in the Phœnician god "Elion," that is, Most High. It is used to imply that the God whom Melchisedec served is THE TRUE God, and not one of the gods of the nations around. So it is used in the only other cases in which it is found in the New Testament, namely in the address of the demoniac, and the divining damsel constrained to confess that her own gods were false, and God the only true God.<p>who met Abraham&#8212;in company with the king of Sodom (Ge 14:17, 18).<p>slaughter&#8212;perhaps defeat, as Alford translates.

Various have been the opinions of writers concerning Melchizedek; some have thought him to be more than a man; some, that he was an angel; others, that he was the Holy Ghost; and others, that he was a divine person superior to Christ, which needs no refutation; others have supposed that he was the Son of God himself: but he is expressly said to be like unto him, and Christ is said to be of his order; which manifestly distinguish the one from the other; besides, there is nothing said of Melchizedek which proves him to be more than a man: accordingly others take him to have been a mere man; but these are divided; some say that he was Shem, the son of Noah, which is the constant opinion of the Jewish writers (z): but it is not true of him, that he was without father, and without mother, an account of his descent being given in Scripture; nor is it probable that he should be a king of a single city in Ham's country, and Abraham be a stranger there: others say, that he was a Canaanitish king, of the posterity of Ham; others affirm him to be a perfect sinless man, and that all that is said of him in Genesis, and in this context, is literally true of him; but that he should be immediately created by God, as Adam, and be without sin as he, are things entirely without any foundation: others take him to be a mere man, but an extraordinary one, eminently raised up by God to be a type of the Messiah; and think it most proper not to inquire curiously who he was, since the Scripture is silent concerning his genealogy and descent; and that as it should seem on purpose, that he might be a more full and fit type of Christ; and this sense appears best and safest. Aben Ezra says, his name signifies what he was, the king of a righteous place: Salem, of which he was king, was not Shalem, a city of Shechem, in the land of Canaan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a> afterwards called Salim, near to which John was baptizing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-23.htm">John 3:23</a> where is shown the palace of Melchizedek in its ruins, which cannot be, since that city was laid to the ground, and sowed with salt by Abimelech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-45.htm">Judges 9:45</a> but Jerusalem is the place; which is the constant opinion of the Jews (a), and is called Salem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm">Psalm 86:2</a>. The interpretation of this word is given in the next verse; some of the Jewish writers referred to say, that it was usual for the kings of Jerusalem to be called Melchizedek and Adonizedek, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a> just as the kings of Egypt were called Pharaoh. This king was also <p>priest of the most high God, as he is said to be, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a> for he was both king and priest, in which he was an eminent type of Christ; and his being a king is no objection to his being a priest, since it was usual for kings to be priests; and though the Hebrew word "Cohen" sometimes signifies a prince, it cannot be so understood here, not only because the word is rendered "priest" by the Septuagint, and by the apostle, but because he is called the priest of God; and Christ is said to be of his order: and he is styled the priest of God, because he was called and invested by him with this office, and was employed in his service; who is said to be the most high God, from his dwelling on high, and from his superior power to all others, and to distinguish him from idol gods; this is a character of great honour given to Melchizedek; <p>who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings; the four kings, whose names are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a> whom Abraham slew, and over whom he got an entire victory, with only three hundred and eighteen men of his own house, after they had conquered the kings of Sodom, Gomorrha, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela: which shows that war is lawful; that enemies may be slain in war; that kings may fall as well as other men; and that those who have conquered others, may be conquered themselves: and as he was returning with his spoils, Melchizedek met him; not alone, which is not to be supposed of so great a person; nor empty, for he brought with him bread and wine, not for sacrifice, as the Papists would have it; but as Jarchi, a Jewish interpreter on the place observes, they used to do so to such as were fatigued in war; for this is to be considered as a neighbourly action, done in point of interest and gratitude, and was a truly Christian one, and very laudable and commendable; and doubtless had something in it typical of Christ, who gives to hungry and weary saints the bread of life, and refreshes them with the wine of divine love and grace: <p>and blessed him; Abraham, and the most high God also: the form of blessing both is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19</a>. This was not a mere civil salutation, nor only a congratulation upon his success, nor only a return of thanks for victory, though these things are included; nor did he do this as a private person, but as the priest of the most high God, and blessed him in his name authoritatively, as the high priest among the Jews afterwards did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23</a> and in this he was a type of Christ, who blesses his people with all spiritual blessings, with redemption, justification, pardon, peace, and all grace, and with eternal glory. <p>(Gill changed his mind on the location of Salam when he later wrote the Old Testament portion of the Expositor.

In all the twenty centuries of sacred history he is only mentioned once, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>. This chapter is a mystical explanation of the significance of these two brief allusions. It was not wholly new, since the Jews attached high honour to the name of Melchisedek, whom they identified with Shem, and Philo had already spoken of Melchisedek as a type of the Logos (<span class="ital">De Leg, Alleg.</span> iii. 25, Opp. i. 102).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">king of Salem</span>] Salem is probably a town near Shechem. It is the same which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.">Genesis 33:18</a> (though there the words rendered “to Shalem” <span class="ital">may</span> mean “in safety”), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-23.htm" title="And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.">John 3:23</a>; and it is the Salumias of <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/4-4.htm" title="Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and the villages and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba, and Esora, and to the valley of Salem:">Jdt 4:4</a>. This is the view of Jerome, who in his Onomasticon places it eight miles south of Bethshean. The site is marked by a ruined well still called <span class="ital">Sheikh Salim</span> (Robinson, <span class="ital">Bibl. Res.</span> iii. 333). In Jerome’s time the ruins of a large palace were shewn in this place as “the palace of Melchisedek;” and this agrees with the Samaritan tradition that Abraham had been met by Melchisedek not at Jerusalem but at Gerizim. The same tradition is mentioned by Eupolemos (Euseb. <span class="ital">Praep. Evang.</span> ix. 17. See Stanley, <span class="ital">Sin. and Pal.</span> p. 237). The more common view has been that Salem is a shortened form of Jerusalem, but this is very improbable; for (1) only a single instance of this abbreviation has been adduced, and that only as a poetic license in a late Psalm which the LXX. describe as “A Psalm with reference to the Assyrian” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm" title="In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.">Psalm 76:2</a>). (2) Even this instance is very dubious, for (<span class="greekheb">α</span>) the Psalmist <span class="ital">may</span> be intending to <span class="ital">contrast</span> the sanctuary of Melchisedek with that of David; or (<span class="greekheb">β</span>) even here the true rendering may be “His place has been made <span class="ital">in peace</span>” as the Vulgate renders it. (3) Jerusalem in the days of Abraham, and for centuries afterwards was only known by the name Jebus. (4) The typical character of Melchisedek would be rather impaired than enhanced by his being a king <span class="ital">at Jerusalem</span>, for that was the holy city of the Aaronic priesthood of which he was wholly independent, being a type of One in whose priesthood men should worship the Father in all places alike if they offered a spiritual worship. We must then regard Salem as being a different place from Jerusalem, if any place at all is intended. For though both the Targums and Josephus (<span class="ital">Antt.</span> i. 10 § 2) here identify Salem with Jerusalem, the Bereshith Rabba interprets the word Salem as an appellative, and says that it means “Perfect King,” and that this title was given to him because he was circumcised (see Wünsche, <span class="ital">Bibl. Rabbinica</span>. Beresh. Rabba, p. 198). Philo too says “king of peace, for that is the meaning of Salem” (<span class="ital">Leg. Alleg</span>, iii. 25, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-5.htm" title="For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.">Isaiah 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>). Nothing depends on the solution of the question, for in any case the fact that “Salem” means “peace” or “peaceful” is pressed into the typology. But the Salem near Sichem was itself in a neighbourhood hallowed by reminiscences scarcely less sacred than those of Jerusalem. Besides this connexion with the name of Melchisedek, it was the place where Jacob built the altar <span class="ital">El-Elohe-Israel</span>; the scene of John’s baptism; and the region in which Christ first revealed Himself to the woman of Samaria as the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">priest of the most high God</span>] The union of Royalty and Priesthood in the same person gave him peculiar sacredness (“He shall be a Priest upon His throne” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-13.htm" title="Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.">Zechariah 6:13</a>). “Rex Anius, rex idem hominum, Phoebique sacerdos” (Virg. <span class="ital">Aen.</span> iii. 80 and Servius <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>). The expression “God most high” is <span class="ital">El Elîôn</span>, and this was also a title of God among the Phoenicians. It is however certain that Moses meant that Melchisedek was a Priest of God, for though this is the earliest occurrence of the name <span class="ital">El Elîôn</span> it is afterwards combined with “Jehovah” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>, and in other parts of the Pentateuch and the Psalms. There is no difficulty in supposing that the worship of the One True God was not absolutely confined to the family of Abraham. The longevity of the early Patriarchs facilitated the preservation of Monotheism at least among some tribes of mankind, and this perhaps explains the existence of the name <span class="ital">Elîon</span> among the Phoenicians (Philo Byblius <span class="ital">ap.</span> Euseb. <span class="ital">Praep. Evang.</span> i. 10).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings</span>] Amraphel king of Shinar, with three allies, had made war on Bera king of Sodom with four allies, and had carried away plunder and captives from the Cities of the Plain. Among the captives was Lot. Abraham therefore armed his 318 servants, and with the assistance of three Canaanite chiefs, Aner, Mamre, and Eshcol, pursued Amraphel’s army to the neighbourhood of Damascus, defeated them, rescued their prisoners, and recovered the spoil. The word here rendered “slaughter” (<span class="ital">kopç</span> from <span class="ital">kopto</span> “cut”) may perhaps mean no more than “smiting,” i.e. defeat. On his return the king of Sodom going forth to greet and thank him met him at “the valley of Shaveh, which is the king’s dale,” a place of which nothing is known, but which was probably somewhere in the tribe of Ephraim near mount Gerizim. This seems to have been in the little domain of Melchisedek for we are not told that “he went forth to meet” Abraham, but only that (being apparently at the place where Bera met Abraham) he humanely and hospitably brought out bread and wine for the weary victors, and blessed Abraham, and blessed God for granting him the victory. In acknowledgment of this friendly blessing, Abraham “gave him tithes of all,” i.e. of all the spoils.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and blessed him</span>] Evidently as a priestly act. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/14-19.htm" title="And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:...">Genesis 14:19-20</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὗτος</span>) The subject, namely, <span class="ital">This</span> man, who is mentioned ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a> from the psalm, and the same who is mentioned in Genesis.

The summary of this chapter is: Christ, as is shown by the type Melchisedec, who was greater than Abraham himself, from whom Levi is descended, has a priesthood truly excellent, new, perfect, stedfast, everlasting.—<span class="greekheb">βασιλεὺς</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἱερεὺς</span>, <span class="ital">king—priest</span>) Christ is also both.—<span class="greekheb">ἱερεὺς τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑψίστου</span>) So the LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18</a>; that is, <span class="ital">Priest of the Most High</span> GOD.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ συναντήσας Ἀβραὰμ ὑποστρέφοντι ἀπὸ τῆς κοπῆς</span>) The LXX., ibid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-17.htm" title="For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 7:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξῆλθε δὲ βασιλεὺς Σοδόμων εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ μετὰ τὸ ὑποστρέψαι αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς κοπῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

Therefore this passage does not prevent us from believing that Arioch, king of Ellasar, lived and reigned after the disaster. There I did not venture to affirm that Arioch is the same as Arius, and I am less disposed to do so now. To such a degree is the antiquity of the Assyrians uncertain abroad, which L.

But we have only to enter into the mind of the writer to see that it is not so. For it is the ideal of the psalm, conceived as suggested by the historical type, that gives its color to the language used. And, indeed, how strangely suggestive is that fragment about the priestly king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-21</a>) so unexpectedly interposed in the life of Abraham! In the midst of a history in which such a point is made of the parentage and descent of the patriarchs of Israel, at a time of peculiar glory of the first and greatest of them, one suddenly appears on the scene, a priest and king, not of the peculiar race at all, his parentage and ancestry unrecorded and unknown, who blesses and receives tithes from Abraham, and then as suddenly disappears from view. We hear no more of him; as about his origin, so about his end, Scripture is silent. And so he "abides" before the mind's eye, apart from any before or after, the type of an unchanging priesthood. For the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in itself denoting the absence, not of ancestors, but of a traced genealogy), cf. ver. 6, 6 <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. That of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, is illustrated by the Latin expression, "Nullis majoribus ortus." On "made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) unto the Son of God," Chrysostom says, "We know of no beginning or end in either case; in the one, because none are recorded; in the other, because they do not exist." The idea seems to be that Melchizedek is thus assimilated to Christ in the sacred record, by what it leaves untold no less than by what it tells. It is not said that he is like him (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), but made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> represented in such wise as to resemble him. It may be here remarked that, though the term "Son of God" is used in the Epistle generally to denote the Messiah as manifested in time, his essential eternal being is here, as elsewhere, distinctly intimated; also that "the Son of God" is regarded as the archetype of the comparison: "Non dicitur Filius DEI assimilatus Melchizedeko, sed contra; nam Filius DEI est antiquior et archetypus" (Bengel). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For this Melchisedec, etc.<p>See <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1-7</a>. </body></html>
