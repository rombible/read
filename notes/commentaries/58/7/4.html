The Jews had a profound veneration for Abraham, and if it could be shown that Melchizedek was superior to Abraham, then it would be easy to demonstrate the superiority of Christ as a priest to all who descended from Abraham. Accordingly he argues, that he to whom even the patriarch Abraham showed so much respect, must have had an exalted rank. Abraham, according to the views of the East, the illustrious ancestor of the Jewish nation, was regarded as superior to any of his posterity, and of course was to be considered as of higher rank and dignity than the Levitical priests who were descended from him.<p>Even the patriarch Abraham - One so great as he is acknowledged to have been. On the word "patriarch," see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29</a>. It occurs only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8-9</a>, and in this place.<p>Gave the tenth of the spoils - see the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-2.htm">Hebrews 7:2</a>. The argument here is, that Abraham acknowledged the superiority of Melchizedek by thus devoting the usual part of the spoils of war, or of what was possessed, to God by his hands, as the priest of the Most High. Instead of making a direct consecration by himself, he brought them to him as a minister of religion, and recognized in him one who had a higher official standing in the matter of religion than himself. The Greek word rendered here "spoils" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  akrothinion - means literally, "the top of the heap," from &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  akron, "top," and &#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;  thin, "heap." The Greeks were accustomed, after a battle, to collect the spoils together, and throw them into a pile, and then, before they were distributed, to take off a portion from the top, and devote it to the gods; Xen. Cyro. 7, 5, 35; Herod. i. 86, 90; 8:121, 122; Dion. Hal. ii. In like manner it was customary to place the harvest in a heap, and as the first thing to take off a portion from the top to consecrate as a thank-offering to God. The word then came to denote the "first-fruits" which were offered to God, and then the best of the spoils of battle. It has that sense here, and denotes the spoils or plunder which Abraham had taken of the discomfited kings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. consider&#8212;not merely see, but weigh with attentive contemplation, the fact.<p>even&#8212;"to whom (as his superior) Abraham even paid tithe (went so far as to pay tithe) of (consisting of, literally, 'from') the best of the spoils (literally, 'the top of the heap"; whether of corn, the first-fruits of which, taken from the top, used to be consecrated to God; or of spoils, from the top of which the general used to take some portion for consecration to God, or for his own use)."

The greatness of this high priest is what he sets in their view, and that indefinitely: How great is this officer!
