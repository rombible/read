The incident here mentioned belongs, of course, to a later date. It is not expressly recorded in Scripture, but is related by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. iii.</span> 8, § 6); and, apart from internal probability, might almost be concluded from the narrative of the Pentateuch itself. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/40-9.htm" title="And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.">Exodus 40:9-15</a> we read of the divine injunction that Moses should put the anointing oil not only upon Aaron and his sons, their garments, and the altar, but also upon the Tabernacle and its vessels. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/8-10.htm" title="And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.">Leviticus 8:10-12</a> is recorded the fulfilment of this command; but in the later verses of the same chapter we read that the altar was sprinkled with the blood of the sin-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>), and that Moses sprinkled Aaron and his sons and their garments with “the anointing oil and the blood which was upon the altar.” Manifestly we may infer that the Tabernacle and its vessels were included in the latter ceremony. Whatever was connected with the covenant which God made with His people must be sprinkled with the blood, which at once typified purification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>), and ratified the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-17.htm" title="For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives.">Hebrews 9:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-21.htm" title="Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry....">Hebrews 9:21-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moreover </span>— To prefigure the efficacy of the sacrifice of Christ to render our acts of worship acceptable; <span class="ital">he sprinkled with blood the tabernacle </span>— The altar, and mercy-seat; <span class="ital">and all the vessels of the ministry </span>— All that were used in the tabernacle service.

Or he means, no remission was granted on the day of atonement without blood. All this pointed to the blood of Christ, effectually cleansing from all sin, and intimated that there can be no purification from it by any other means. Because some fancy that a real pardon of sin was obtained by the atonements of the Mosaic law, and especially by those made on the tenth of the seventh month, concerning which it is said, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-30.htm" title="For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.">Leviticus 16:30</a>,) <span class="ital">on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you that you may be clean from all your sins: </span>it may be proper to observe here, that “this cleansing of the people from all their sins could not possibly have any reference to the punishments of the life to come, because the atonement was made <span class="ital">for all the people </span>indiscriminately, whether penitent or not, consequently it could not be a cleansing of their consciences, but of their bodies; redeeming them from those civil penalties which God, in the character of their chief magistrate, would have inflicted on them for breaking the laws of the state, unless these atonements had been made. A remission of that kind all the people of the congregation might receive, and it was the only remission which, in a body, they could receive through the sacrifices mentioned. And from the inefficacy of the annual atonements, made on the day above mentioned, to procure for the people the eternal pardon of their sins, it follows that the daily atonements, made by the ordinary priests, had no greater efficacy in procuring their pardon.” — Macknight.

Thus Christ died, not only to obtain the blessings of salvation for us, but to give power to the disposal of them. All, by sin, were become guilty before God, had forfeited every thing that is good; but God, willing to show the greatness of his mercy, proclaimed a covenant of grace. Nothing could be clean to a sinner, not even his religious duties; except as his guilt was done away by the death of a sacrifice, of value sufficient for that end, and unless he continually depended upon it. May we ascribe all real good works to the same all-procuring cause, and offer our spiritual sacrifices as sprinkled with Christ's blood, and so purified from their defilement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He sprinkled ...both the tabernacle - This circumstance is not stated by Moses. On the probability that this was done, see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>. The account of setting up the tabernacle occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1-10</a>. In that account it is said that Moses "anointed" the tabernacle with the holy anointing oil; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9-11</a>. Josephus (Ant. book iii, chapter 8, section 6), says that he consecrated it and the vessels thereto belonging with the blood of bulls and of rams.

Greek, "And, moreover, in like manner." The sprinkling of the tabernacle with blood is added by inspiration here to the account in Ex 30:25-30; 40:9, 10, which mentions only Moses' anointing the tabernacle and its vessels. In Le 8:10, 15, 30, the sprinkling of blood upon Aaron and his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the altar, is mentioned as well as the anointing, so that we might naturally infer, as Josephus has distinctly stated, that the tabernacle and its vessels were sprinkled with blood as well as being anointed: Le 16:16, 20, 33, virtually sanctions this inference. The tabernacle and its contents needed purification (2Ch 29:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Moses did not only sprinkle the book of the covenant with blood, but the tabernacle itself, yearly, on the atonement day, as is charged, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm" title="And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.">Leviticus 16:14</a>,16,17</span>.

For when the law was proclaimed by Moses, and the people promised to observe the same, the tabernacle had not yet an existence. Exodus 40, where we have the account of the erection and inauguration of the tabernacle, only an <span class="ital">anointing</span> of the tabernacle and its vessels <span class="ital">with oil</span> is enjoined, not a <span class="ital">sprinkling</span> thereof <span class="ital">with blood</span>.

It is possible, however, that Jewish tradition preserved more precise details. At least mention is made by Josephus also (<span class="ital">Antiq</span>. iii. 8. 6) of an aspersion of the tabernacle and its furniture, on the part of Moses, with blood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Erroneously, for the rest (on account of the <span class="ital">aorist</span>), do Owen, Seb.

The tabernacle, however, was not yet erected when the covenant was instituted. Delitzsch supposes that a subsequent though kindred transaction is referred to; and colour is given to this supposition by the separation of this verse from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a>.

Neither was it by Moses but by Aaron the tabernacle and the altar were sprinkled with blood and so cleansed on the day of Atonement. When first erected <span class="greekheb">ἡ σκηνὴ καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς</span> were anointed with oil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm" title="And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.">Exodus 40:9</a>) but Josephus records a tradition that it was consecrated not only with oil but also with blood (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. iii. 8, 6). It seems that the author adopts this tradition, and ascribes to Moses at the original consecration of the tabernacle the cleansing rites which afterwards were annually performed by Aaron on the day of Atonement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">both the tabernacle</span>] This again is not mentioned in the scene to which the writer seems to be referring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-6.htm" title="And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar....">Exodus 24:6-8</a>), which indeed preceded the building of the Tabernacle. It is nowhere recorded in Scripture that the <span class="ital">Tabernacle</span> was sprinkled, although it is perhaps <span class="ital">implied</span> that on a later occasion this may have been done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/40-9.htm" title="And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy....">Exodus 40:9-10</a>); and Josephus, closely following the same <span class="ital">Hagadah</span> as the writer, says that such was the case (Jos. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> iii. 8. § 6).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the vessels</span>] This again is not directly mentioned, though we are told that Aaron and his sons, and the altar, were consecrated by such a sprinkling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-30.htm" title="And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Leviticus 8:30</a>), and that the “propitiatory” was so sprinkled on the Day of Atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm" title="And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.">Leviticus 16:14</a>).

It is true that no sprinkling of the tabernacle or its furniture with blood is mentioned in the Pentateuch; only the anointing of them with oil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>). But the garments of Aaron and his sons are said on that occasion to have been sprinkled with the blood as well as with the anointing oil (Hebrews 8:30), and Josephus ('Ant.,' 3:08. 6) says that this blood-sprinkling was extended also to the tabernacle and its vessels (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;</span>). Here, as well as in ver. 19, our writer may be supposed to follow the traditional account, with which there is still nothing in the Pentateuch inconsistent. Be it observed again that the force of the argument does not depend on these added details, but on the general principle, abundantly expressed in the original record, which is assorted in the following verse. </body></html>
