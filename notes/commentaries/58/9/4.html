The question raised does not merely concern the interpretation of a single verse, but has been brought into prominence in all recent discussions as to the authorship of the Epistle. It will be possible to notice all important points in the controversy without entering into any discussion of the Greek, for it is allowed on both sides that the word here used—<span class= "ital">thumiaterion</span> (which simply means an instrument or a place connected with the offering of incense)—will admit of either rendering. The usage of the LXX., in most cases peculiarly helpful in this Epistle, throws little light on the matter; for this word is entirely absent from the descriptions in the Pentateuch, and occurs twice only in later books (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm" title="And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.">Ezekiel 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-19.htm" title="Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.">2Chronicles 26:19</a>—both times for “censer”). The Pentateuch, indeed, makes no mention of a special censer for the use of the high priest on the Day of Atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a>); but, as we learn from the Mishna, the later law not only prescribed a censer of gold, but laid stress on the particular kind of gold. On the other hand, in Philo and Josephus the word here used is the regular designation of the <span class= "ital">altar of incense.</span> That altar, it is true, was not of gold, only overlaid with gold; but as one of its names in common use was “the golden altar” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:5</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) this point is of no moment. If we look at internal probabilities, it is hard to decide which would be more surprising—the special mention of the censer (by the side of the ark and the cherubim) in this description of the Most Holy Place, or the absence of all notice of the incense-altar, which held so important a place in connection with the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement. Hence, though “censer” has (mainly through the influence of the Vulgate) been the more familiar rendering, the most eminent modern commentators have, with some marked exceptions, adopted the other view. Probably there would be little difference of opinion on the question, were it not that the words here used seem to assign to the altar of incense a place <span class= "ital">within the veil.</span> As, however, there are the strongest reasons for believing that the golden censer was not kept in the Holiest Place, this difficulty applies almost equally to both interpretations. At first sight the difficulty is very great. The incense-altar and the ark are coupled together, and the word which describes their relation to the Holiest Place is that which, a little later in this verse, distinctly signifies “containing.” So weighty is this consideration that many have been unable to avoid the conclusion that the writer has erred in this matter of detail; and various suppositions have been resorted to in explanation of his mistake. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) But, to take the lowest ground, surely ignorance on such a point is inconceivable. Not only are the notices in Exodus perfectly plain, but passages in Philo and Josephus show how customary in the writer’s own age it was to speak of the three sacred objects in the Holy Place—the candlestick, the table, and the golden altar. There must exist some special reason for this connection of the altar with the Most Holy Place—a connection which (we may well believe) would have been otherwise expressed had the writer held it possible that readers, familiar with the facts, could regard his language as even ambiguous. Such a reason will be found to be suggested by the language of the Pentateuch, and by the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm" title="And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.">Exodus 30:6</a>, Moses receives special injunction to place the altar of incense “before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony;” similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:5</a>. The purification of this altar is most expressly associated with the purification of the Holiest Place on the Day of Atonement: this stands out in strong relief both in the Pentateuch (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm" title="And Aaron shall make an atonement on the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement on it throughout your generations: it is most holy to the LORD.">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-18.htm" title="And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.">Leviticus 16:18</a>) and in the Mishna. The typical significance of the altar of incense (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-13.htm" title="And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,">Revelation 9:13</a>) we might also show to be in full harmony with the thought here presented. There is, however, one passage in the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm" title="And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.">1Kings 6:22</a>) which appears to give direct expression to what these other passages imply; for there the true translation must be, “also <span class= "ital">the whole altar that belongeth to the oracle</span> he overlaid with gold.”<span class= "note">[10]<p>[10] Some interesting remarks on this passage will be found in a paper by Dr. Milligan in the <span class= "ital">Bible Educator</span> (vol. iii., p. 230). His suggestion is that the writer, having in mind the Day of Atonement, sees the Tabernacle with its inner veil withdrawn.</span><p><span class= "bld">Ark of the covenant</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm" title="And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.">Numbers 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm" title="Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>often called “the ark of the testimony,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the ark containing the tables of the Ten Commandments, which were the symbol of the covenant of God with the people.

There is no mention of a “golden” vessel in the Hebrew of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.">Exodus 16:33</a>; the word is added in the LXX. It will be observed that this epithet is mentioned three times in the verse: such splendour was natural in the sanctuary “of this world” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/hebrews/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;...">Hebrews 9:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Which had the golden censer </span>— Used by the high-priest only on the great day of atonement. “The apostle may have learned from the priests that this censer was of gold, and that it was left by him in the inward tabernacle, so near to the veil, that when he was about to officiate next year, by putting his hand under the veil he could draw it out to fill it with burning coals, before he entered into the most holy place to burn the incense, agreeably to the direction,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:...">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>; where see the note. <span class="ital">And the ark of the covenant </span>— This, with the mercy-seat wherewith it was covered, was the most glorious and mysterious utensil of the tabernacle, and afterward of the temple, the most eminent pledge of God’s presence, and the most mysterious representation of the divine attributes in Christ. This being the heart, so to speak, of all divine services, was first formed; all other things in the Jewish worship had a relation to it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-10.htm" title="And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof....">Exodus 25:10-11</a>. Sometimes it is called <span class="ital">the ark of the testimony, </span>because God called the tables of the covenant lodged in it by the name of his <span class="ital">testimony, </span>or that which testified his will to the people, and which, by the people’s acceptance of the terms of it, was to be a perpetual witness between God and them. On the same account it is called <span class="ital">the ark of the covenant, </span>and lastly, it is called <span class="ital">the ark of God, </span>because it was the most eminent pledge of the special presence of God among the people. As to its fabric, it was <span class="greekheb">παντοθεν</span>, <span class="ital">every way, </span>within and without, overlaid with plates of beaten gold. This being the most sacred and glorious instrument of the sanctuary, all neglects about it, and contempt of it, were most severely punished. From the tabernacle it was carried into the temple built by Solomon, wherein it continued until the Babylonish captivity, and what became of it afterward is altogether uncertain. <span class="ital">Wherein was the golden pot that had manna </span>— The monument of God’s care over Israel. When the manna first fell, every one was commanded to gather an omer for his own eating, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-16.htm" title="This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take you every man for them which are in his tents.">Exodus 16:16</a>,) and God appointed that an omer of it should be put into a pot, and kept in the tabernacle before the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.">Exodus 16:33</a> : there it was miraculously preserved from putrefaction, whereas otherwise it would have putrefied in less than two days. The pot was to be made of that which was most durable, as being to be kept for a memorial throughout all generations. Because it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.">1 Kings 8:9</a>, <span class="ital">there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, </span>the words <span class="greekheb">εν η</span>, here used by the apostle, may be translated, <span class="ital">nigh to which. </span>Or the difficulty may be removed by supposing that the pronoun <span class="greekheb">η</span>, <span class="ital">which, </span>relates to <span class="greekheb">σκηνη</span>, <span class="ital">tabernacle, </span>in which <span class="ital">tabernacle </span>also <span class="ital">was the golden pot: </span>or because it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm" title="Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>, <span class="ital">Take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark, </span>we may conjecture that the book was put into some repository fixed to the side of the ark, and that the pot of manna was laid up before the Lord in the same manner. <span class="ital">Aaron’s rod that budded </span>— The monument of a regular priesthood. The apostle affirms only that it <span class="ital">budded, </span>but in the sacred story concerning the trial about the priesthood, recorded <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/17-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write you every man's name on his rod....">Numbers 17:2-10</a>, it is added, that it <span class="ital">brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds, </span>being originally cut from an almond-tree. This rod Moses took from before the testimony when he was to smite the rock and work a miracle, of which this was consecrated to be the outward sign; <span class="ital">and the tables of the covenant — </span>The two tables of stone on which the ten commandments were written by the finger of God; the most venerable monument of all. <span class="ital">And over it </span>— Over the ark; <span class="ital">the cherubim of glory </span>— “Cherubim being the name of an order of angels, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm" title="So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.">Genesis 3:24</a>,) the figures called <span class="ital">cherubim, </span>placed on the sides of the mercy-seat, with the glory of the Lord resting between them, represented the angels who surround the manifestation of the divine presence in heaven.

The tabernacle was a movable temple, shadowing forth the unsettled state of the church upon earth, and the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily. The typical meaning of these things has been shown in former remarks, and the ordinances and articles of the Mosaic covenant point out Christ as our Light, and as the Bread of life to our souls; and remind us of his Divine Person, his holy priesthood, perfect righteousness, and all-prevailing intercession. Thus was the Lord Jesus Christ, all and in all, from the beginning. And as interpreted by the gospel, these things are a glorious representation of the wisdom of God, and confirm faith in Him who was prefigured by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which had the golden censer - The censer was a "fire-pan," made for the purpose of carrying fire, in order to burn incense on it in the place of worship. The forms of the censer were various. Some difficulty has been felt respecting the statement of Paul here that the "golden censer" was in the most holy place, from the fact that no such utensil is mentioned by Moses as pertaining to the tabernacle, nor in the description of Solomon's temple, which was modelled after the tabernacle, is there any account of it given. But the following considerations will probably remove the difficulty.<p>(1) Paul was a Jew, and was familiar with what pertained to the temple, and gave such a description of it as would be in accordance with what actually existed in his time. The fact that Moses does not expressly mention it, does not prove that in fact no such censer was laid up in the most holy place.<p>(2) Aaron and his successors were expressly commanded to burn incense in a "censer" in the most holy place before the mercy-seat. This was to be done on the great day of atonement, and but once in a year; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>.<p>(3) there is every probability that the censer that was used on such an occasion was made of gold. All the implements that were employed in the most holy place were made of gold, or overlaid with gold, and it is in the highest degree improbable that the high priest would use any other on so solemn an occasion; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>.<p>(4) as the golden censer was to be used only once in a year, it would naturally be laid away in some secure situation, and none would so obviously occur as the most holy place. There it would be perfectly safe. No one was permitted to enter there but the high priest, and being preserved there it would be always ready for his use. The statement of Paul, therefore, has the highest probability, and undoubtedly accords with what actually occurred in the tabernacle and the temple. The object of the incense burned in worship was to produce an agreeable fragrance or smell; see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>.<p>And the ark of the covenant - This ark or chest was made of shittim-wood, was two cubits and a half long, a cubit and a half broad, and the same in height; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>. It was completely covered with gold, and had a "lid," which was called the "mercy-seat," on which rested the Shekinah, the symbol of the divine presence, between the outstretched wings of the cherubim. It was called "the ark of the covenant," because within it were the two tables of the covenant, or the Law of God written on tables of stone. It was a simple "chest, coffer, or box," with little ornament, though rich in its materials. A golden crown or molding ran around the top, and it had rings and staves in its sides by which it might be borne; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12-16</a>. This ark was regarded as the most sacred of all the appendages of the tabernacle. Containing the Law, and being the place where the symbol of the divine presence was manifested, it was regarded as especially holy, and in the various wars and revolutions in the Hebrew commonwealth, it was guarded with special care.<p>After the passage over the Jordan it remained for some time at Gilgal <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>, whence it was removed to Shiloh; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>. From hence, the Israelites took it to their camp, apparently to animate them in battle, but it was taken by the Philistines; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>. The Philistines, however, oppressed by the hand of God, resolved to return it, and sent it to Kirjath-Jearim; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>. In the reign of Saul it was at Nob. David conveyed it to the house of Obededom, and thence to his palace on Mount Zion; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>. At the dedication of the temple it was placed in the Holy of Holies by Solomon, where it remained for many years. Subsequently, it is said, the wicked kings of Judah, abandoning themselves to idolatry, established idols in the most holy place itself, and the priests removed the ark, and bore it from place to place to secure it from profanation. "Calmet." When Josiah ascended the throne he commanded the priests to restore the ark to its place in the sanctuary, and forbade them to carry it about from one place to another as they had before done; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-3.htm">2 Chronicles 35:3</a>. The subsequent history of the ark is unknown. It is probable that it was either destroyed when the city of Jerusalem was taken by Nebuchadnezzar, or that it was carried with other spoils to Babylon, There is no good reason to suppose that it was ever in the second temple, and it is generally admitted by the Jews that the ark of the covenant was one of the things that were wanting there. Abarbanel says, that the Jews flatter themselves that it will be restored by the Messiah.<p>Wherein - That is, in the ark - for so the construction naturally requires. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>, however, it is said that there was nothing in the ark, "save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb," and it has been supposed by some that the pot of manna and the rod of Aaron were not in the ark, but that they were in capsules, or ledges made on its sides for their safe keeping, and that this should be rendered "by the ark." But the apostle uses the same language respecting the pot of manna and the rod of Aaron which he does about the two tables of stone, and as they were certainly in the ark, the fair construction here is that the pot of manna and the rod of Aaron were in it also. The account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-32.htm">Exodus 16:32-34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>, is, that they were laid up in the most holy place, "before the testimony," and there is no improbability whatever in the supposition that they were in the ark. Indeed, that would be the most safe place to keep them, as the tabernacle was often taken down and removed from place to place. It is clear from the passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>, that they were not in the ark in the temple, but there is no improbability in the supposition that before the temple was built they might have been removed from the ark and lost. When the ark was carried from place to place, or during its captivity by the Philistines, it is probable that they were lost, as we never hear of them afterward.<p>The golden pot - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>, it is simply "a pot," without specifying the material. In the Septuagint it is rendered "golden pot," and as the other utensils of the sanctuary were of gold, it may be fairly presumed that this was also.<p>That had manna - A small quantity of manna which was to be preserved as a perpetual remembrancer of the food which they had eaten in their long journey in the wilderness, and of the goodness of God in miraculously supplying their wants. As the manna, also, would not of itself keep, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-20.htm">Exodus 16:20</a>, the fact that this was to be laid up to be preserved from age to age, was a perpetual miracle in proof of the presence and faithfulness of God. On the subject of the manna, see Bush's notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a>.<p>And Aaron's rod that budded - That budded and blossomed as a proof that God had chosen him to minister to him. The princes of the tribes were disposed to rebel, and to call in question the authority of Aaron. To settle the matter, each one was required to take a rod or staff of office, and to bring it to Moses with the name of the tribe to which it appertained written on it. These were laid up by Moses in the tabernacle, and it was found on the next day that the rod marked with the name of Levi had budded and blossomed, and produced almonds. In perpetual remembrance of this miracle, the rod was preserved in the ark; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-13</a>. Its subsequent history is unknown. It was not in the ark when the temple was built, nor is there any reason to suppose that it was preserved to that time.<p>And the tables of the covenant - The two tables of stone on which the ten commandments were written. They were expressly called "the words of the covenant" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>. On the word "covenant"; see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-16.htm">Hebrews 9:16</a> and 17 of this chapter. These two tables were in the ark at the time the temple was dedicated. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>. Their subsequent history is unknown. It is probable that they shared the fate of the ark, and were either carried to Babylon, or were destroyed when the city was taken by Nebuchadnezzar. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. golden censer&#8212;The Greek, must not be translated "altar of incense," for it was not in "the holiest" place "after the second veil," but in "the holy place"; but as in 2Ch 26:19, and Eze 8:11, "censer": so Vulgate and Syriac. This GOLDEN censer was only used on the day of atonement (other kinds of censers on other days), and is therefore associated with the holiest place, as being taken into it on that anniversary by the high priest. The expression "which had," does not mean that the golden censer was deposited there, for in that case the high priest would have had to go in and bring it out before burning incense in it; but that the golden censer was one of the articles belonging to, and used for, the yearly service in the holiest place. He virtually supposes (without specifying) the existence of the "altar of incense" in the anterior holy place, by mentioning the golden censer filled with incense from it: the incense answers to the prayers of the saints; and the altar though outside the holiest place, is connected with it (standing close by the second veil, directly before the ark of the covenant), even as we find an antitypical altar in heaven. The rending of the veil by Christ has brought the antitypes to the altar, candlestick, and showbread of the anterior holy place into the holiest place, heaven. In 1Ki 6:22, Hebrew, "the altar" is said to belong to the oracle, or holiest place (compare Ex 30:6).<p>ark&#8212;of shittim wood, that is, acacia.

In 1Ki 8:9; 2Ch 5:10, it is said there was nothing in the ark of Solomon's temple save the two stone tables of the law put in by Moses. But the expression that there was nothing THEN therein save the two tables, leaves the inference to be drawn that formerly there were the other things mentioned by the Rabbis and by Paul here, the pot of manna (the memorial of God's providential care of Israel) and the rod of Aaron, the memorial of the lawful priesthood (Nu 17:3, 5, 7, 10). The expressions "before the Lord" (Ex 16:32), and "before the testimony" (Nu 17:10) thus mean, "IN the ark." "In," however, may be used here (as the corresponding Hebrew word) as to things attached to the ark as appendages, as the book of the law was put "in the side of the ark," and so the golden jewels offered by the Philistines (1Sa 6:8).<p>tables of the covenant&#8212;(De 9:9; 10:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which had the golden censer; </span> in the holy of holiest was reserved the golden censer, on which the high priest put the incense when annually he entered there, <span class="ital">{see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a>,13</span>}</span> that the cloud of it might cover the mercy-seat, and so was kept for that service in it: see Joseph.

There were various censers used by the priests in the daily service, but this was a peculiar one, which was used by the high priest on the day of atonement; on other days he used a silver censer, but on that day a golden one, and with it he entered into the holy of holies (y); and though Moses does not call it a golden one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a> yet Josephus does (z); and so do the Jewish doctors in the place referred to, with whom the apostle agrees, and to this the allusion is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a> but here a difficulty arises, how this can be said to have been in the holy of holies, and within the vail, when, according to Moses, it was without the vail, and was only carried within on the day of atonement; and so Philo the Jew (a) places it in the other part of the tabernacle; and it seems as if it was to avoid this difficulty, that the Ethiopic version has removed it from this verse to verse the second, and put it among the things that were in the holy place; but there is no need of this, nor to say that the altar of incense is intended, for that is never so called, and, besides, was without the vail too. It should be observed, that the apostle does not say, that the golden censer was laid up in the holy of holies, and kept there, but that it "had" it; as it had it on the day of atonement, when it was carried in there by the high priest, who there made use of it; and it was for the use of it in that place, that it was peculiarly designed. What was done by it was this, burning coals were with it taken off from the altar before the Lord, and were brought in within the vail, where incense was put upon them, which covered the mercy seat, that so the high priest died not. The burning coals signify the very great sufferings of Christ, not only the sufferings of his body, which were very painful, but those of his soul, when the wrath and hot displeasure of God was poured out upon him; and those coals being taken off from the altar before the Lord, show that the sufferings of Christ were according to the will of God, were grateful to him, and always before him; and their being brought within the vail, does not denote that Christ is now in a suffering state, though he is in the midst of the throne, as a lamb that had been slain; but the continued virtue and efficacy of his sufferings, and that our faith and hope, which enter within the vail, have to do with his blood and sacrifice thither carried. And the incense, which was carried in with those coals, typified the intercession of Christ in heaven, which is pure and holy, sweet, fragrant, and perpetual; and the priest having his hands full of it, expresses the fulness of Christ's intercession for all his elect, and for all things for them, and his fulness of merit to plead, which makes his intercession efficacious and prevalent; and hence, through his much incense, the prayers of his people become odorous and acceptable: and the incense being put upon the burning coals in the censer, shows that Christ's intercession proceeds upon the foot of his blood and sacrifice, his sufferings and death; and hence it becomes grateful, and has its influence; the smoke of it covers the mercy seat, or throne of grace, and makes that accessible; and as the priest, who offers it, never dies, so none of those for whom he intercedes. <p>And the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold; this is called the ark of the covenant, because the tables of the covenant, afterwards mentioned, were put into it; and that it was overlaid with gold round about, is certain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a> where it is said to be overlaid with pure gold, within and without; and that the ark was within the vail, and in the most holy place, is manifest from  <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-21.htm">Exodus 40:21</a> that this was wanting in the second temple, is generally agreed (b); but who took it away, where it was put, or what became of it various are the sentiments of the Jewish writers: some say (c), it was carried away by Nebuchadnezzar into Babylon, and is meant by the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-10.htm">2 Chronicles 36:10</a> others say (d), that Jeremiah the prophet took it, and hid it in a cave on Mount Nebo; but the more generally received opinion is, that it was hid by King Josiah in some hidden and deep place, which Solomon had built for that purpose under ground, knowing, that the temple would be destroyed (e); and it is often said, that it was hid under the pavement of a room in the temple, called  , "the wood room" (f). The ark is, by some, thought to be a type of the church, which is the ark of God, of his building, and where he dwells; the ark of the covenant, or testimony, where the oracles of God, his word and ordinances, are: its being made of Shittim wood may denote the incorruption and duration of it: and its being covered with gold within and without is expressive of its glory; and its being portable, and carried from place to place, shows that the church is not always in one place; its rings, staves, and priests that bore it, may point at the Gospel, and the ministers of it, the instruments of moving it; and its moving from place to place, and falling into the hands of enemies, were emblematical of the church's afflictions; as its rest at last, in Solomon's temple, may signify the church's rest here and hereafter: but the ark is rather to be considered as a type of Christ; its various names agree with Christ, as the ark of God, the ark of his strength, the glory of God, the face of God, the holy ark, the ark of the covenant, or testimony, yea, Jehovah, and God himself: the time of its making is observable, it was made before the tabernacle, and the tabernacle for the sake of it; Christ is before all creatures, and was set up as Mediator before anything existed, and all things are for his sake; it being made of Shittim wood, covered with gold, may denote both the incorruption and glory of Christ; and its several decorations, the graces with which he was adorned, as man and Mediator; its staves and rings may design the word, ordinances, and ministers, whereby he is carried into the several places of the world; here God granted his presence, and counsel was asked of him, and it was brought forth in time of war, as a security from enemies, all which is applicable to Christ; by it wonders were done, as the dividing of Jordan for the Israelites to pass into the land of Canaan, the falling of the walls of Jericho, and the fall of Dagon; so Christ has opened the way for his people to heaven, has spoiled principalities and powers, and his Gospel is powerful to the pulling down the strongholds of sin and Satan; the moving of the ark from place to place, and its rest in the temple, may signify the rest of Christ, after his many fatigues in this world. <p>Wherein was the golden pot that had manna; which Aaron filled with manna by the direction of Moses, who gave it at the appointment of God, that it might be preserved to future ages, as a memorial of the goodness, care, and power of God in feeding the Israelites with it in the wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>. This pot held an omer, which was more than three pints and a half; some say six pints: and though Moses does not call it a golden pot, yet it is so called, not only by the Septuagint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a> but also by Philo the Jew (g); nor is it reasonable to think, with some Jewish writers (h), that it should be made of earth, which was to continue for ages to come: this also was wanting in the second temple (i); and this, with Aaron's rod, after mentioned, and other things, is said to be hid when the ark was, and along with it (k): but how this pot, as well as Aaron's rod, can be said to be in the ark, when it is asserted, at the bringing of the ark into the temple, at the dedication of it by Solomon, that there was nothing in it but two tables of stone, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a> and both the pot of "manna", and Aaron's rod, are said to be before the testimony, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a> and not in it, is a difficulty. Some, in order to remove it, observe, that the phrase, "wherein", refers not to the ark, but to the tabernacle; but since the tables of the covenant were in the ark, and these are mentioned with it, and the phrase, "over it", in the next verse, cannot be understood of the tabernacle, but of the ark, this solution is not satisfactory. Others have observed, that they might be in the ark in Moses's time and in Jeremiah's time, when they are said to be hid, though they were not in Solomon's: and others have taken notice, that the preposition sometimes signifies "at", or "with", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a> and so the sense is, that these were near unto it in the most holy place, and might be in the sides of it, though not within it; for there were places in the sides of the ark to put things into, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>. And certain it is from the above account from Scripture, that they were near it; and so, by the Jewish writers, they are always mentioned along with it: when that was carried away, and hid, they were hid with it; but what a certain Jewish commentator (l) observes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a> is so express, as if it was designed to vindicate our apostle: his remark is this: <p>"the intention of this is not to deny that there were not the things mentioned in the law, for they were , "left in it", as Aaron's "rod", and "the pot of manna", only to deny, hereby, that there was not anything of the law, save the decalogue.'' <p>And it should be observed, that it is not said of these, that they were put before the ark, but "before the testimony"; that is, before the tables of the covenant, which were within the ark. The "manna", in this pot, was typical of Christ; in the signification of its name, whether it comes from  "manah", which signifies to appoint, prepare, and distribute, Christ being appointed, prepared, and distributed, as food for his people; or from , "man hu", what is it? the words said by the Israelites, when they first saw it, not knowing what it was; so Christ is unknown to his people until revealed to them, and remains unknown to all natural and unregenerate men: the manna came from heaven, from God, and was a free gift of his, and so Christ: it was round in form, and may be expressive of Christ's perfection, and eternity: it was in colour white, which may signify his purity and innocence; it was sweet in taste, and so is Christ, his fruits, his word and ordinances: it was small in quantity, which may denote the meanness and despicableness of Christ in the eyes of the world: the people went out and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and baked it, and ate, which may be typical of the apprehension, sufferings, and death of Christ, in order to be fit food for the faith of believers. The persons that were fed by it were the Israelites, who were brought out of Egypt, and then in the wilderness, a large number, and men of all sorts, rich, and poor, and who had an equal portion, though very undeserving; so those who are fed by Christ, and nourished with him, the bread of life, are the spiritual Israel of God, whom Christ has redeemed from worse than Egyptian bondage and darkness, though they are yet in the wilderness of this world; and they are a large number, the whole family of God, who receive out of Christ's fulness grace for grace; and there is no difference of high and low, rich and poor, bond or free, male or female; they are all one in Christ, and Christ is all in all; and they have all a whole Christ, though they are very undeserving, being by nature children of wrath as others. And as the Israelites had the manna every day, and all the while they were in the wilderness, so Christ is the daily bread of believers; by him, in his word and ordinances, is his church nourished in the wilderness, to whom he gives to eat of the hidden manna, the food of the wilderness. The "pot", in which this manna was kept, was typical of the ordinances of the Gospel; in its matter, being made of gold, denoting the preciousness and duration of them; in the size of it, holding an "omer", showing that these contain plenty of good things to satisfaction; in the situation of it before the ark, signifying the presence of Christ with his ordinances; and in its use to hold manna, and be a memorial of it to ages to come, as the ordinances have in them food for souls, and are the means of remembering Christ in future generations, till his second coming. <p>And Aaron's rod that budded; and not only budded, but bloomed; blossomed, and yielded almonds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>. This also was laid before the ark of the testimony, <a href="http://www.bibleapps.com/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>, and may be said to be in it, or with it, in the same sense as the pot of manna was; it was likewise wanting in the second temple (m), and is said to be hid with the pot of manna, and other things, as before observed: it was a type of Christ: it is affirmed by the Jews, that in the days of the Messiah, the priesthood shall return, and the rod of Aaron shall flourish (n); it was, very probably, as some have thought (o), an almond tree stick, as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>. The almond tree has its name, in Hebrew, from a word which signifies haste and vigilance; it being, as Pliny says (p), the first of trees that buds and blossoms, and is very hasty in putting them forth. An almond tree rod may be a proper emblem of Christ's speedy incarnation in the fulness of time; and Aaron's almond tree rod, of his right to the priesthood, and his vigilance in it: this was first a dry rod or stick, and may design the mean descent and appearance of Christ, being born of mean parents, living a mean and obscure life; his entrance on his public ministry, and continuance in it, were without any pomp or grandeur; he was as a root out of a dry ground; and though he did many miracles, these were treated with contempt; and he was at last apprehended, arraigned, and condemned as a malefactor, and died a shameful and an accursed death: it looked very unlikely and unpromising, that he should be the King Messiah; that he should have all power in heaven and in earth; that he should have the wisdom he had, and do the miracles he did; and that he should be the author of eternal salvation; and that such fruits of grace, peace, pardon, and righteousness, should spring from him, as that Aaron's dry rod should bud, blossom, and bear almonds, in which it was a lively figure of Christ; that lying among other rods, and perhaps being like them, may denote Christ's assuming the common nature of men, or an individual of human nature in all things like to man: and this being cut off from the tree, and being a dry stick, may represent the death of Christ; and its budding and blossoming may point at the resurrection of Christ from the dead; and as Aaron's priesthood was confirmed by the budding and blossoming of his rod, so the deity and Messiahship of Christ are confirmed by his resurrection; and its bringing forth almonds may design the fruits of Christ's death and resurrection; and moreover, the almond tree being, as Philo the Jew says (q) the first of trees that buds and blossoms in the spring, and the last that casts its leaves, it may be, as he observes, a symbol of the priestly tribe; and it may be a figure of the perpetuity of Christ, and his priesthood: <p>and the tables of the covenant; the same with the testimony which was ordered to be put into the ark, and accordingly was,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>. About this there is no controversy; though it is a matter of dispute with the Jews, whether the book of the law was in the ark or not: some say it was in the side of it, and others within it (r); but Maimonides (s) says, that Moses wrote the whole law with his own hand before he died, and gave a book (or copy) to every tribe, and one copy he put  "in the ark": so Jarchi says (t), that the book of the law of Moses was put into the midst of the ark, and the ark was glorious and beautiful by that which was  "within it". These tables were made of stone, an emblem of the hardness of man's heart, which is destitute of spiritual life and motion, senseless and stupid, impenitent, stubborn, and inflexible, and on which no impressions can be made but by powerful and efficacious grace; and also of the stability and duration of the law, as moral, which is not antiquated by another, nor made void by the Gospel, nor altered in its nature and terms, but remains the same as to the matter of it; though it is now no covenant of works to believers, and they are freed from the curse and condemnation of it: the number of these tables is two; the whole law is reduced by our Lord to two grand precepts of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a> and the fleshly tables, on which it is reinscribed in regeneration, are the heart and mind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>. The place where these tables were put is the ark, which was typical of the law being in Christ, not only in his hands, but in his heart, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a> and in his keeping of which he is the fulfilling end; for he being the surety of his people, and becoming man, answered every part of the law; in the holiness of his nature, in the perfect obedience of his life, and in his sufferings and death, in which he bore the penalty of it: and these tables are called the tables of the covenant, because the law on Mount Sinai was a covenant made with the people of Israel; and was typical of the covenant, of which Christ is the surety and Mediator, and which is ratified by his blood. <p>(y) Misn.

To this usage of the LXX., however, is to be opposed the equally important fact of the usage of Philo and Josephus, according to which, at their time, <span class="greekheb">τὸ θυμιατήριον</span> was quite the ordinary appellation of the altar of incense. Comp. Philo, Quis rerum divin. haeres. p. 511 sq. (with Mangey, I. p. 504): <span class="greekheb">τριῶν ὄντων ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις σκευῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">λυχνίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">τραπέζης</span>, <span class="greekheb">θυμιατηρίου</span>; De vita Mos. p. 668 (II. p. 149): <span class="greekheb">Ἅμα δὲ τούτῳ ἐδημιουργεῖτο καὶ σκεύη ἱερά</span>, <span class="greekheb">κιβωτός</span>, <span class="greekheb">λυχνία</span>, <span class="greekheb">τράπεζα</span>, <span class="greekheb">θυμιατήριον</span>, <span class="greekheb">βωμός</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ μὲν οὖν βωμὸς ἵδρυτο ἐν ὑπαίθρῳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; Josephus, de Bello Jud. v. 5. 5 : <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον μέρος</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἶχεν ἐν αὐτῷ τρία θαυμασιώτατα καὶ περιβόητα πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἔργα</span>, <span class="greekheb">λυχνίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τράπεζαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">θυμιατήριον</span> Antiq. iii. 6, 8 : <span class="greekheb">μεταξὺ δὲ αὐτῆς</span> (<span class="greekheb">τῆς λιχνίας</span>) <span class="greekheb">καὶ τῆς τραπέζης ἔνδον</span> … <span class="greekheb">θυμιατήριον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ξύλινον μὲν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., al. Of the altar of incense, accordingly, the expression must be understood in our passage. For the manner in which the <span class="greekheb">χρυσοῦν θυμιατήριον</span> is mentioned, as a parallel member to <span class="greekheb">τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης</span>, shows that the former must be an object of equally great importance as the latter. But, since that is so, something as non-essential as a golden censer cannot be meant, but only the altar of incense, which formed an essential constituent part of the tabernacle. Besides, there is nowhere any mention in the O. T. (not <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a> either) of a particular censer, which had been set apart for the service on the great day of atonement. About the existence of such a censer at the time of the Mosaic tabernacle, which the author after all has mainly before his mind, nothing is known with certainty. Only from the Mishna, tract. Joma, iv. 4,[89] do we learn something about it. Moreover, according to tract. <span class="ital">Joma</span>, v. 1, vii. 4, this censer was first fetched out of the storehouse, carried by the high priest into the Most Holy Place, and upon the completion of the service again carried forth therefrom; even as it would be <span class="ital">a priori</span> improbable in the highest degree that such instrument should be kept within the Holy of Holies. For, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:...">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>, the high priest was first to enter with incense into the Most Holy Place, in order that through the cloud thereof the glory of God, enthroned above the cover of the ark of the covenant, might become invisible to him, to the end that he died not. And yet <span class="greekheb">ἔχουσα</span> compels us to think of an <span class="ital">abiding</span> place of the <span class="greekheb">θυμιατήριον</span>; to explain <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΧΟΥΣΑ</span></span></span> of the mere <span class="ital">appertaining</span> of the <span class="greekheb">θυμιατήριον</span> to the Most Holy Place as an object of use for the latter, as is usually done by the one class of expositors (but also by some advocates of the opposite view, as Jac. Cappellus, Piscator, Owen, Mynster, Ebrard, Delitzsch, Conybeare, Riehm, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 490, <span class="ital">Obs</span>.; Maier, Moll, Hofmann, and Woerner, with an appeal to <span class="greekheb">הַמִּזְבֵּהַ אֲשֶׁר־לֵדְּבִיר</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm" title="And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.">1 Kings 6:22</a>), is—inasmuch as the author sharply separates from each other in his description the two main divisions of the O. T. sanctuary, as well as the objects peculiar to each of these divisions, by means of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΤᾺ ΔΈ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-3.htm" title="And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;">Hebrews 9:3</a>, and thus <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΧΟΥΣΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>, unmistakably corresponds to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ᾟ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2</a>—altogether arbitrary. If, then, we understand <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΥΜΙΑΤΉΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span> of the altar of incense, as we are compelled to do, there arises the archaeological difficulty that this altar had its standing-place not in the Most Holy Place, as is here presupposed by the author, but, on the contrary, in the Holy Place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it.">Exodus 30:1</a> ff.). This point of inconsistency with historic truth is to be admitted, and therefrom the conclusion to be drawn, that the author did not himself live in the vicinity of the Jewish sanctuary, but had drawn his knowledge with regard to the same only from the Scriptures of the O. T., whence the possibility of an error is explicable. In favour of this possibility, Bleek rightly urges the following considerations: first, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm" title="And you shall set the table without the veil, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and you shall put the table on the north side.">Exodus 26:35</a> there are mentioned as standing within the Holy Place only the table and the candlestick, but not the altar of incense also. Then, that where the standing place of this altar is actually spoken of, the form of expression chosen certainly, by reason of its indefiniteness, admitted of misconstruction. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm" title="And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.">Exodus 30:6</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΘΉΣΕΙς ΑὐΤῸ ἈΠΈΝΑΝΤΙ ΤΟῦ ΚΑΤΑΠΕΤΆΣΜΑΤΟς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΤΟῦ ὌΝΤΟς ἘΠῚ Τῆς ΚΙΒΩΤΟῦ ΤῶΝ ΜΑΡΤΥΡΊΩΝ</span></span></span>; <span class="ital">ibid</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">καὶ θήσεις τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χρυσοῦν εἰς τὸ θυμιᾶν ἐναντίον τῆς κιβωτοῦ</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἀπέναντι τοῦ καταπετάσματος</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm" title="And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-18.htm" title="And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.">Leviticus 16:18</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐναντίον</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἀπέναντι κυρίου</span>. Finally, that in the Mosaic law the altar of incense was brought into peculiar significance in connection with the solemnity of the atonement, since on this day it was sprinkled and cleansed by the high priest with the same blood which the high priest had carried into the Most Holy Place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm" title="And Aaron shall make an atonement on the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement on it throughout your generations: it is most holy to the LORD.">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-18.htm" title="And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.">Leviticus 16:18</a> f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χρυσοῦν</span>] since the emphasis rests on it, is prefixed. The article, however, is wanting, because the sense is: <span class="ital">a golden altar, namely, the altar of incense</span>, in distinction from the <span class="ital">brazen altar</span> existing in the court, namely, the altar of burnt-offering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης</span>] <span class="ital">and the ark of the covenant</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm" title="And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:10</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/37-1.htm" title="And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:...">Exodus 37:1-9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΚΕΚΑΛΥΜΜΈΝΗΝ ΠΆΝΤΟΘΕΝ ΧΡΥΣΊῼ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">overlaid on every side</span> (within and without; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-11.htm" title="And you shall overlay it with pure gold, within and without shall you overlay it, and shall make on it a crown of gold round about.">Exodus 25:11</a>) <span class="ital">with gold</span> (plating of fine gold).

Besides, the form of the word indicates that it could be used of anything on which incense is offered. It was, therefore, understood of the “altar” by Clement Alex. and other fathers; by Calvin, who says, “quo nomine altare suffitus vel thymiamatis potius intelligo quam thuribulum;” and by most modern scholars. As has frequently been urged it is incredible that in describing the furniture of the tabernacle there should be no mention of the altar of incense. Difficulty has been felt regarding the position here assigned to it, for in fact it stood outside the veil; and the author has been charged with error.

The altar was indeed so strictly connected with the Sancta Sanctorum that in the directions originally given for its construction this was brought out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it....">Exodus 30:1-6</a>). “Thou shalt set it before the veil (<span class="greekheb">ἀπέναντι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καταπετάσματος</span>) that is over the ark of the testimony,” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a>, “it is most holy (<span class="greekheb">ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων</span>) to the Lord”.

In LXX and N.T. appropriated to the chest in the Holy of Holies or to the ark in which Noah was rescued. For its construction see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm" title="And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">περικεκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντοθεν χρυσίῳ</span> representing “inside and outside” <span class="greekheb">ἔσωθεν καὶ ἔξωθεν χρυσώσεις αὐτήν</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-11.htm" title="And you shall overlay it with pure gold, within and without shall you overlay it, and shall make on it a crown of gold round about.">Exodus 25:11</a>.

Paul also uses this word in contrasting the stone tables of the Law with the <span class="greekheb">σάρκιναι πλάκες</span> of the heart. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.">1 Kings 8:9</a> it is stated that when Solomon’s Temple was dedicated these tables were the sole contents of the ark. In the tabernacle, however, as here described the ark also contained <span class="greekheb">στάμνος χρυσῆ ἔχουσα τὸ μάννα</span> “a golden jar containing manna,” as directed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/16-33.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations....">Exodus 16:33-34</a>, Moses said to Aaron <span class="greekheb">λάβε στάμνον χρυσοῦν ἕνα</span>, where it is masculine; in Aristoph. <span class="ital">Plut</span>. 545, feminine (see Stephanus, s.v.). Usually it was of earthenware and used for holding wine, honey, etc. <span class="greekheb">τὸ μάννα</span> in Exod. <span class="greekheb">μάν</span> is the form used; in the other books <span class="greekheb">μάννα</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος Ἀαρὼν ἡ βλαστήσασα</span>, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/17-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Numbers 17:1-10</a>, when the rods of the tribes were laid up before the Lord to determine who were the legitimate priests, <span class="greekheb">ἱδοὺ ἐβλάστησεν ἡ ῥάβδος Ἀαρὼν</span>. Chrysostom remarks that the contents of the ark were venerable and significant memorials of Israel’s rebellion; the tables of the covenant for the first were broken on account of their sin; the manna reminding them of their murmuring; the rod that budded of their jealousy of Aaron.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπεράνω δὲ αὐτῆς χερουβεὶν δόξης</span> … “And over it [the ark] Cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercyseat” [“obumbrantia propitiatorium” (Vulg.)]. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-18.htm" title="And you shall make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shall you make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat....">Exodus 25:18-22</a>, the Cherubim were to be two in number, made of gold, one at each end of the ark, looking towards one another, and overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings [<span class="greekheb">συσκιάζοντες ἐν ταῖς πτέρυξιν αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου</span>]. The Cherubim seem to have symbolised, in the manner of the Assyrians and Egyptians, the creatures of God, all that is best in creation, by a combination of excellences found in no single creature. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm" title="As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.">Ezekiel 1:10</a> they have four faces, of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, representing respectively intelligence, strength, steadfastness, rapidity. But <span class="ital">cf.</span> Davidson, p. 173 and Cheyne’s art. in <span class="ital">Encycl. Bibl</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόξῃς</span>, the Cherubim are here called “of glory,” probably because closely attached to and, as it were, attendant upon, the place of the manifestation of the divine glory. [“Als <span class="ital">Träger</span> der Herrlichkeit, in welcher die göttliche Gnadengegenwart sich kund that” (Weiss).] <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἱλαστήριον</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-17.htm" title="And you shall make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.">Exodus 25:17</a> Moses is instructed to make a golden cover [<span class="greekheb">כַּפֹּרֶת</span>] to be laid upon the lid of the ark, and this instruction the LXX renders by the words <span class="greekheb">ποιήσεις ἱλαστήριον ἐπίθεμα f1χρυσίου καθαροῦ</span>. The word <span class="greekheb">ἐπίθεμα</span> alone, without any qualifying adjective, would have been an adequate translation of <span class="greekheb">כַּפֹּרֶת</span>, for both words mean “a cover”. But <span class="greekheb">ἐπίθεμα</span> is nowhere else used in the LXX to translate <span class="greekheb">כַּפֹּרֶת</span>, which is regularly translated by <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span>, although this word does not express the idea of a material covering. [Philo more than once remarks upon this. In <span class="ital">De Profug.</span>, 19, in speaking of symbols, he says <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἵλεω δυνάμεως τὸ ἐπίθεμα τῆς κιβωτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καλεῖ δὲ αὐτὸ ἱλαστήριον</span>. And in <span class="ital">Vit. Mos</span>. iii. 68, <span class="greekheb">ἧς ἐπίθεμα ὡσανεὶ πῶμα τὸ λεγόμενον ἐν ἱεραῖς βίβλοις ἱλαστήριον</span>.] The reason of this usage is to be found in the fact that this “cover” was sprinkled with blood on the day of atonement, and came, therefore, to be associated with the <span class="ital">covering</span> of sin. Indeed, the Hebrew word which denotes the material covering is that which is regularly used to express the covering of sin. The original <span class="greekheb">ἐπίθεμα</span> thus became a <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον ἐπίθεμα</span> and finally <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span>. (See Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bibelstud</span>. p. 121–132.) <span class="greekheb">περὶ ὧν</span> … <span class="greekheb">μέρος</span> “of which we cannot now speak in detail”. <span class="greekheb">ἔστιν</span>, as commonly in classical Greek = <span class="greekheb">ἔξεστι</span>. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ μέρος</span> = one by one. Examples in Wetstein and Bleek (see especially Plato, <span class="ital">Theaet</span>. 157B, where it is opposed to <span class="greekheb">ἄθροισμα</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">the golden censer</span>] The Greek word is <span class="ital">thumiaterion</span>, and it has been long disputed whether it means Censer or Altar of Incense. It does not occur in the Greek version of the Pentateuch (except as a various reading) where the “altar of incense” is rendered by <span class="ital">thusiasterion thumiamatos</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-8.htm" title="And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,">Exodus 31:8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-11.htm" title="And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.">Luke 1:11</a>); but it is used by the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-19.htm" title="Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.">2 Chronicles 26:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm" title="And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.">Ezekiel 8:11</a>, and there means “censer;” and the Rabbis say that “a golden censer” was used by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement only (<span class="ital">Yoma</span>, iv. 4). “Censer” accordingly is the rendering of the word in this place in the Vulgate, Syriac, Arabic and Æthiopic versions; and the word is so understood by many commentators ancient and modern. On the other hand (which is very important) both in Josephus (<span class="ital">Antt.</span> iii. 6 § 8) and in Philo (Opp. i. 504) the word <span class="ital">thumiaterion</span> means “<span class="ital">the Altar of Incense</span>,” which, like the table, might be called “golden,” because it was overlaid with gold; and this is the sense of the word in other Hellenistic writers of this period down to Clemens of Alexandria. The Altar of Incense was so important that it is most unlikely to have been left unmentioned. Further, it is observable that we are not told of <span class="ital">any</span> censer kept in the <span class="ital">Tabernacle</span>, but only in the Temple. The incense in the days of the Tabernacle was burnt in a <span class="ital">machettah</span> (<span class="greekheb">πυρεῖον</span>, “brazier,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a>); nor could the censer have been kept in the Holiest Place, for then the High Priest must have gone in to fetch it before kindling the incense, which would have been contrary to all the symbolism of the ritual.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But it is asserted that the writer is in any case mistaken, for that <span class="ital">neither</span> the censer nor the “altar of incense” were in the Holiest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But this is not certain as regards the censer. It is possible that some golden censer-stand may have stood in the Holiest, on which the High Priest placed the small golden brazier (<span class="ital">machettah</span>, LXX. <span class="ital">pureion</span>), which he carried with him. There is indeed no doubt that the “Altar of Incense” was <span class="ital">not</span> in the <span class="ital">Holiest</span> Place, but as all authorities combine in telling us, in the Holy Place. But there was a possibility of mistake about the point because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm" title="And you shall set the table without the veil, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and you shall put the table on the north side.">Exodus 26:35</a> only the table and the lamp-stand are mentioned; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm" title="And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.">Exodus 30:6</a> is a little vague. Yet the writer does not say that the altar of incense was <span class="ital">in</span> the Holiest It was impossible that any <span class="ital">Jew</span> should have made such a mistake, unless he were, as Delitzsch says, “a monster of ignorance;” and if he had been unaware of the fact otherwise, he would have found from Philo in several places (<span class="ital">De Victim Offer</span>. § 4; <span class="ital">Quis Rer. Div. Haer.</span> § 46) that the Altar (which Philo also calls <span class="ital">thumiaterion</span>) was outside the Holiest. Josephus also mentions this, and it was universally notorious (<span class="ital">B. J.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a>, § 5). Accordingly, the writer only says that the Holiest “<span class="ital">had</span>” the Altar of Incense, in other words that the Altar in some sense <span class="ital">belonged to it</span>. And this is rigidly accurate; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm" title="And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.">1 Kings 6:22</a> the altar is described as “belonging to” the Oracle (lit. “the Altar which <span class="ital">was to</span> the Oracle,” <span class="ital">laddebîr</span>), and on the Day of Atonement the curtain was drawn, and the Altar was intimately associated with the High Priest’s service in the Holiest Place. Indeed the Altar of Incense (since incense was supposed to have an atoning power, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-47.htm" title="And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the middle of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.">Numbers 16:47</a>) <span class="ital">was itself called</span> “Holy of Holies” (A. V. “most holy,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm" title="And Aaron shall make an atonement on the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement on it throughout your generations: it is most holy to the LORD.">Exodus 30:10</a>) and is expressly said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm" title="And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.">Exodus 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:5</a>) to be placed “<span class="ital">before</span> the mercy-seat.” In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple....">Isaiah 6:1-8</a> a seraph flies from above the mercy-seat to the Altar. The writer then, though he is not entering into details with pedantic minuteness, has not made any mistake; nor is there the smallest ground for the idle conjecture that he was thinking of the Jewish Temple at Leontopolis. The close connection of the Altar of Incense with the service of the Day of Atonement in the Holiest Place is illustrated by <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-1.htm" title="It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophet commanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hath been signified:...">2Ma 2:1-8</a>, where the Altar is mentioned in connexion with the Ark.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the ark of the covenant</span>] This, as we have seen, applies only to the Tabernacle and to Solomon’s Temple. “There was nothing whatever,” as Josephus tells us, in the Holiest Place of the Temple after the Exile (<span class="ital">B. J.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a>. § 5). The stone on which the ark had once stood, called by the Rabbis “the stone of the Foundation,” alone was visible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">overlaid round about with gold</span>] The word “round about” means literally “on all sides,” i.e. “within and without” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-11.htm" title="And you shall overlay it with pure gold, within and without shall you overlay it, and shall make on it a crown of gold round about.">Exodus 25:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with gold</span>] The diminutive <span class="greekheb">χρυσίῳ</span> here used for gold seems to imply nothing distinctive. Diminutives always tend to displace the simple forms in late dialects.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the golden pot that had manna</span> …] The Palestine Targum says that it was an <span class="ital">earthen</span> jar, but Jewish tradition asserted that it was of gold. The LXX. inserts the word “golden” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.">Exodus 16:33</a> and so does Philo. It contained an “omer” of the manna, which was the daily portion for each person. The writer distinctly seems to imply that the Ark <span class="ital">contained</span> three things—a golden jar (<span class="ital">stamnos</span>) containing a specimen of the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the Stone Tables of the Decalogue. Here again it is asserted that he made a mistake. Certainly the Stone Tables were in the Ark, and the whole symbolism of the Ark represented the Cherubim bending in adoration over the blood-sprinkled propitiatory which covered the tables of the broken moral law. But Moses was only bidden to lay up the jar and the rod “<span class="ital">before the Testimony</span>” not “<span class="ital">in the Ark</span>;” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.">1 Kings 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-10.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.">2 Chronicles 5:10</a> we are somewhat emphatically informed that “there was nothing in the Ark” except these two tables, which we are told (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-2.htm" title="And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which you brake, and you shall put them in the ark.">Deuteronomy 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm" title="And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>) that Moses placed there. All that can be said is that the writer is not thinking of the Temple of Solomon at all, and that there is nothing impossible in the Jewish tradition here followed, which supposes that “before the Testimony” was interpreted to mean “in the Ark.” Rabbis like Levi Ben Gershom and Abarbanel had certainly no desire to vindicate the accuracy of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and yet they say that the pot and the rod were actually at one time <span class="ital">in</span> the Ark, though they had been removed from it before the days of Solomon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Aaron’s rod that budded</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/17-6.htm" title="And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods....">Numbers 17:6-10</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χρυσοῦν</span>, <span class="ital">golden</span>) The apostle uses such words as signify something precious and glorious, as <span class="greekheb">δόξης</span>, <span class="ital">of glory</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">θυμιατήριον</span>) <span class="ital">censer</span>. So the LXX. express <span class="greekheb">מקטרת</span>, a censer for frankincense; not the ALTAR of incense, which had no more need to be mentioned than the altar of whole burnt-offering, which is not mentioned. But the censer alone, along with the ark of the covenant, is named in this verse, because it was the principal part of the furniture which the high priest used on the day of expiation; and although it was on that day alone that he both carried in and again carried out the censer, yet the participle <span class="greekheb">ἔχουσα</span>, having, is consonant with the fact.[49] Further, this is put first, because a description of the <span class="ital">ark</span> follows at greater length.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾗ</span>, <span class="ital">in which</span>) namely, <span class="greekheb">κιβωτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">the ark;</span> for to it also is to be referred <span class="greekheb">αὐτῆς</span>, over <span class="ital">it</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm" title="And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.">Hebrews 9:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">στάμνος χρυσῆ ἔχουσα τὸ μάννα</span>, <span class="ital">the golden pot that had manna</span>) <span class="greekheb">μάννα</span>, <span class="ital">manna</span>, has the article, not <span class="greekheb">στάμνος</span>, <span class="ital">the pot;</span> for the thing contained was of more importance than the golden vessel which contained it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.">Exodus 16:33</a>, <span class="greekheb">צנצנת אחת</span>; LXX. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΆΜΝΟΝ ΧΡΥΣΟῦΝ ἝΝΑ</span></span></span>. Some suspect that this pot and rod of Aaron, two most remarkable memorials, which were furnished with a perpetual miracle, had been taken out of the ark before the building of the temple; others, that they were put in not until afterwards, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.">1 Kings 8:9</a> mention is only made of the tables laid up in the ark.

It may mean either censer or altar of incense.

These are the only instances of the word in lxx: accordingly, never in lxx of the altar of incense. Josephus uses it for both. The golden censer is not mentioned in O.T. as a part of the furniture of the holy of holies. The facts of the case then are as follows: (a) according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31</a> the incense-altar was in the holy place, not in the holy of holies; (b) Philo and Josephus use &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; for the altar of incense; (c) there is no mention in O.T. of a censer set apart for the day of atonement; (d) the high priest was to enter with incense, so that the ark might be veiled by the smoke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>). Hence the censer could not have been kept in the holy of holies; (e) the writer clearly speaks of an abiding-place of the &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;in a particular division of the tabernacle. There is evidently a discrepancy, probably owing to the fact that the writer drew his information from the O.T. by which he might have been led into error. Thus <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>, there are mentioned in the holy place without the veil only the candlestick and the table, and not the incense-altar. Again, when the standing-place of the incense altar was mentioned, the expressions were open to misconstruction: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>. On the day of atonement, the incense-altar, like the most holy place, was sprinkled with blood. This might have given rise to the impression that it was in the holy of holies.<p>With gold (&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Properly, wrought gold.<p>Wherein (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#837;)<p>But according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>, neither the pot of manna nor Aaron's rod was in the ark, but "before the testimony"; while in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>, Moses was commanded to put only the tables of the law into the ark; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a> it is said of the ark in the temple, "there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone." The writer follows the rabbinical tradition that the pot of manna and the rod were inside of the ark.<p>Golden pot (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;)<p>&#x3a3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, N.T.o, a few times in lxx, rare in Class.
