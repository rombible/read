On the Day of Atonement the high priest came before what was but a symbol of the Divine Presence; he caused the Holiest Place to be filled with the smoke of the incense before he entered with the blood of the offering. He did not dare to delay his return, even by prolonging his prayer, lest he should “excite terror in Israel.” In the heavenly sanctuary the High Priest is made manifest before the face of God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>.) Three different words in these verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>) are in the Authorised version rendered by the same word “appear”: “to make manifest,” “to manifest,” “to appear,” may serve as renderings which shall keep in mind the difference of the words. The form of the Greek verb might seem to imply a single appearance only; by the added word “now the writer corrects, or rather enlarges, the thought, and shows that the true meaning is a manifestation which is both one and unceasing. With emphasis he places at the close the words which indicate “the people” whose High Priest He has become.

The first is, that from the fall of Adam to the end of the world, no man will be pardoned but through Christ’s offering himself to God a sacrifice for sin. The second is, that although Christ offered himself only once, that one offering is in itself so meritorious, and of such efficacy in procuring pardon for the penitent, that its influence reacheth backward to the beginning of the world, and forward to the end of time; on which account Christ is with great propriety termed, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a>,) <span class="ital">the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world;” </span>or from the time of man’s fall, for the necessity of Christ’s offering himself a sacrifice for sin did not take place immediately at the creation, but at the fall. <span class="ital">But now once in the end of the world </span>— At the conclusion of the Mosaic dispensation, and the entrance of gospel times, which are the last season of God’s grace to the church.

Sin would still have been upon us, and have had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyed the works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, and happy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep one of the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises or neglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemer liveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience of the church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayer as the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands - Into the temple or tabernacle. The Jewish high priest alone entered into the most holy place; and the other priests into the holy place. Jesus, being of the tribe of Judah, and not of Levi, never entered the temple proper. He had access only to the courts of the temple, in the same way as any other Jew had; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>. He has entered into the true temple - heaven - of which the earthly tabernacle was the type.<p>Which are the figures of the true - Literally, "the antitypes" -  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;  antitupa. The word properly means what is formed after a model, pattern, or type; and then what corresponds to something or answers to it. The idea here is, that the "type" or "fashion" - the "true" figure or form - was shown to Moses in the Mount, and then the tabernacle was made after that model, or corresponded to it. The "true original" figure is heaven itself; the tabernacle was an antitype of that - or was so formed as in some sense to correspond to it. That is, it corresponded in regard to the matters under consideration - the most holy place denoted heaven; the mercy-seat and the shekinah were symbols of the presence of God, and of the fact that he shows mercy in heaven; the entrance of the high priest was emblematical of the entrance of the Redeemer into heaven; the sprinkling of the blood there was a type of what the Redeemer would do in heaven.<p>Now to appear in the presence of God for us - As the Jewish high priest appeared before the shekinah, the symbol of the divine presence in the tabernacle, so Christ appears before God himself in our behalf in heaven. He has gone to plead for our salvation; to present the merits of his blood as a permanent reason why we should be saved; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Resumption more fully of the thought, "He entered in once into the holy place," Heb 9:12. He has in Heb 9:13, 14, expanded the words "by his own blood," Heb 9:12; and in Heb 9:15-23, he has enlarged on "an High Priest of good things to come."<p>not &#8230; into &#8230; holy places made with hands&#8212;as was the Holy of Holies in the earthly tabernacle (see on [2569]Heb 9:11).<p>figures&#8212;copies "of the true" holiest place, heaven, the original archetype (Heb 8:5).<p>into heaven itself&#8212;the immediate presence of the invisible God beyond all the created heavens, through which latter Jesus passed (see on [2570]Heb 4:14; [2571]1Ti 6:16).<p>now&#8212;ever since His ascension in the present economy (compare Heb 9:26).<p>to appear&#8212;To PRESENT Himself; Greek, "to be made to appear."

The saints shall hereafter see God's face in Christ (Re 22:4): the earnest of which is now given (2Co 3:18).

"It is enough that Jesus should show Himself for us to the Father: the sight of Jesus satisfied God in our behalf. He brings before the face of God no offering which has exhausted itself, and, as only sufficing for a time, needs renewal; but He himself is in person, by virtue of the eternal Spirit, that is, the imperishable life of His person, now and for ever freed from death, our eternally present offering before God" [Delitzsch in Alford].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands</span>: <span class="ital">for</span> shows this to be a rational proof of the transcendency of Christ’s death and sacrifice; and this he demonstrates from the place of his ministry, far exceeding that of his type.

The most holy place in the tabernacle of Moses, or in the temple built by Solomon, and rebuilt by Zerubbabel, and repaired by Herod, <p>which are the figures of the true; that is, the most holy place in the tabernacle and temple, was a figure of the truth of that type; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a> as follows. Josephus (m) suggests the same, when speaking of the most holy place; he says, that it was inaccessible to the priests, that it might be as heaven to God. <p>But into heaven itself; not the visible heavens, the airy and starry ones, through which he passed, but the third heaven, the habitation of God, angels, and glorified saints: this shows that heaven is a place; that Christ, as man, was out of it when on earth; and that at his ascension he entered into it, having done the work he came about, and that with acceptance: the end of his entrance was <p>now to appear in the presence of God for us; Christ, as God, was always in his presence, from everlasting; as Mediator, he was with him in the council of peace; while he was here on earth his Father was with him, he was not alone; but now in his human nature he is at his right hand, where he appears before him, as a favourite before his Prince, on the behalf of another, or as an advocate on the behalf of his client: Christ appears in the court of heaven for his elect, by representing their persons; by presenting himself, his blood, sacrifice, and righteousness, before God on their account; by introducing them into the presence of God, and offering up their prayers with the incense of his mediation; by presenting them to himself, and to his Father, and obtaining every blessing for them. And this he does "now", since his entrance; not that he did not appear before God for the saints of the Old Testament, for he was the angel of God's presence then, though he did not appear then in the manner he does now, as the Lamb in the midst of the throne, as if it had been slain; but it denotes the continuance and perpetuity of his appearance for his people; he is ever interceding for them. <p>(m) Antiqu. l. 3. c. 5. sect. 4. &amp; c. 7. sect. 8. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, <i>which are</i> the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</span><p>(13) Another twofold comparison: the Levitical high priest entered into the sanctuary, which was made indeed by the commandment of God, but yet with men's hands, that it might be a pattern of another more excellent, that is, of the heavenly place, but Christ entered into heaven itself.

According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a> a <span class="greekheb">τύπος</span> of the heavenly realities was shown to Moses, and what he constructed from that model was an <span class="greekheb">ἀντίτυπον</span>, answering to the type. But as here used with <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀληθ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ἀντίτυπα</span> (in agreement with <span class="greekheb">ἅγια</span>) must mean what we usually speak of as a type, that which corresponds to and prefigures. In the only other instance of its occurrence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 3:21</a>, it has the converse meaning, the reality of baptism which corresponds to or is the antitype of the deluge. The <span class="greekheb">ἀντίτυπα</span> are contrasted with <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸν τὸν οὐρανόν</span>, heaven itself [<span class="greekheb">αὐτὸν</span> in contrast to the mere likeness or copy] the ultimate reality, the presence of spiritual and eternal things. “Coelum in quod Christus ingressus est, non est ipsum coelum creatum quodcunque fuerit, sed est coelum in quo Deus est etiam quando coelum creatum nullum est, ipsa gloria divina” (Seb. Schmidt in Delitzsch). <span class="greekheb">νῦν ἐμφανισθῆναι</span> … “now to appear openly before the face of God in our behalf”, <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> “now,” after His completed work on earth, and as his present continuous function; in contrast both to the past ministries, in which face to face communion was impossible, and to Christ’s reappearance to men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐμφανισθῆναι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπῳ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span>. The meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἐμφανίζω</span> is most clearly seen from such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a>. In the passive it means “to be manifest,” “to appear openly” or “clearly,” “to show one’s self,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-53.htm" title="And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.">Matthew 27:53</a> of the bodies of the saints, <span class="greekheb">ἐνεφανίσθησαν πολλοῖς</span>. The infinitive is the infinitive of designed result common in N.T., as in classics, especially after verbs of motion, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-2.htm" title="Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.">Matthew 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-8.htm" title="But what went you out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.">Matthew 11:8</a>, etc. The aorist may here be used to denote that “the manifestation of Christ, in whom humanity is shown in its perfect ideal before the face of God is ‘one act at once’ ”; but this is doubtful. The force of <span class="greekheb">ἐμφαν</span>. is strengthened still more by the emphatic <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπῳ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span>. In the earthly sanctuary the law was <span class="greekheb">τὸ πρόσωπόν μου οὐκ ὀφθήσεται</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-23.htm" title="And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.">Exodus 33:23</a>) but <span class="greekheb">ἐν νεφέλῃ ὀφθήσομαι ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστηρίου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-2.htm" title="My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?">Psalm 42:2</a> we find indeed <span class="greekheb">πότε ἥξω καὶ ὀφθήσομαι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προσώπῳ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span>; but this is the non-literal expression of a poet. In the present passage the words are not the loose expression of the ordinary worshipper but are meant to be taken literally. And the intentionally emphatic character of the whole phrase is best accounted for by the fact that the darkness and clouds of incense in the old sanctuary were meant as much to veil the unworthiness of the priest from God as the glory of God from the priest. Now Christ appears before God face to face with no intervening cloud. Perfect fellowship is attained by His perfect and stainless offering of Himself. All is clear between God and man. For it is <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν</span> “for us” He enters this presence and fellowship; not that He alone may enjoy it, but that we may enter into the rest and blessedness that He has won for us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">For Christ is not entered</span>] “For not into any Material Sanctuary did Christ enter—a (mere) imitation of the Ideal,—but into Heaven itself, now to be visibly presented before the face of God for us.” The Ideal or genuine Tabernacle is the eternal uncreated Archetype as contrasted with its antitype (or “imitation”) made with hands. The Ideal in the Alexandrian philosophy, so far from being an antithesis of the real, meant that which <span class="ital">alone</span> is absolutely and eternally real; it is the antithesis of the <span class="ital">material</span> which is but a perishing imitation of the Archetype. The word “to be visibly presented” (<span class="greekheb">ἐμφανισθῆναι</span>) is not the same as that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a> (<span class="greekheb">πεφανέρωται</span> “He hath been manifested,”) nor with that used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a> (<span class="greekheb">ὀφθήσεται</span> “He shall be seen,”) though all these are rendered in English by the verb “appear.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ</span>, <span class="ital">not</span>) Jesus never went into the inmost recesses of the temple at Jerusalem; never caused a sacrifice to be offered for Himself, during the whole period that elapsed between His baptism and the offering up of Himself.—<span class="greekheb">ἀντίτυπα τῶν ἀληθιονῶν</span>, <span class="ital">the figures of the true</span>) The true were the more ancient: those made with hands were imitations of them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸν τὸν οὐρανὸν</span>, <span class="ital">into heaven itself</span>) and there is nothing beyond it.—<span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">now</span>) So <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐμφανισθῆναι</span>, <span class="ital">to present Himself, to appear</span>) An appropriate word in respect to GOD: in respect to us, <span class="greekheb">πεφανέρωαται</span>, <span class="ital">He hath been manifested</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>, and <span class="greekheb">ὀφθήσεται</span>, <span class="ital">He shall be seen</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a> [The Engl.

"heaven itself," the heaven of heavens, the immediate presence or "face" of God, the "throne of the Majesty on high," to which Christ passed through the intermediate heavens. There he now (the perpetual <span class="accented">now</span> of the new era of accomplished redemption), in his humanity, in behalf of and representing all humanity, beholds for ever the very face of the eternal God, which Moses could not see and live, and of which the typical high priest saw from year to year but the emblem, in transitory glimpses, through intervening clouds of incense. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23, expresses the idea of the earthly sanctuary being a visible representation answering to a heavenly reality. The original <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">type</span>) was shown to Moses in the mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>); what was constructed by him on the earth below was the <span class="accented">antitype</span> to it.
