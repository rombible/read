Though they were formed on the same general model, their very nature and design necessitated changes of plan and detail which unfitted them for the writer’s argument here. So far as the Temple was a copy of the Tabernacle, and so far only, was it made “after the pattern” that Moses had seen; and so far only was its symbolism of divine and not human origin.<p><span class= "bld">The first, wherein was . . .</span>—In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>, when the writer passes from place to ministration, he uses the present tense, although it is of the Tabernacle that he is speaking. The explanation is that which has come before us again and again: the arrangements prescribed in Scripture are to him ever present, abiding from age to age in that unchanging word. Hence probably we should here read <span class= "ital">are</span> instead of “were.” The golden candlestick, the table, and the showbread <span class= "ital">are</span> in the Holy Place as it is described in the Law. With the symbolical meaning of the furniture of the Holy Place we are not here concerned. The writer contents himself with words which plainly imply that none of the parts and arrangements of the Tabernacle were without significance. On the golden candlestick (more strictly, <span class= "ital">lampstand</span>) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31-37</a>, and on the ten candlesticks of the Temple of Solomon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm" title="And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,">1Kings 7:49</a>; on the table and the showbread, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/25-23.htm" title="You shall also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:23-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/24-5.htm" title="And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.">Leviticus 24:5-9</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-48.htm" title="And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the show bread was,">1Kings 7:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-8.htm" title="He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basins of gold.">2Chronicles 4:8</a>). It is somewhat remarkable that the table should here be so distinctly mentioned, for usually (both in the Bible and in Jewish tradition) no special importance appears to be assigned to it apart from the offering which was placed thereon. (Comp., however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-6.htm" title="And you shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure table before the LORD.">Leviticus 24:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm" title="And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the show bread also set they in order on the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but you have forsaken him.">2Chronicles 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-7.htm" title="You offer polluted bread on my altar; and you say, Wherein have we polluted you?

This offering is in Hebrew called “bread of the face”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>bread of the (divine) Presence; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-4.htm" title="How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?">Matthew 12:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-4.htm" title="How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the show bread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?">Luke 6:4</a>, “loaves of the setting forth;” here “the setting forth of the loaves.”<p><span class= "bld">Sanctuary.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">holy place.</span> The same word is applied to the Holy of Holies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>; and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm" title="For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.">Hebrews 13:11</a>. This verse and the next give the proper names of the two parts of the Tabernacle, which must be used when the one is to be distinguished from the other. Where there is no risk of mistake the simpler designation is sufficient. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-17.htm" title="And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.">Leviticus 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-20.htm" title="And when he has made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:">Leviticus 16:20</a>.)

This undoubtedly represented the fulness of spiritual light which was to be in the Messiah, and by him to be communicated to his whole church; <span class="ital">and the table and show-bread </span>— That is, the bread shown continually before God and his people, consisting of twelve loaves, according to the number of the tribes, and placed on this table in two rows, six upon one another in each row. As the candlestick typified the light, so the bread seems to have been an emblem of the spiritual food provided in Christ, especially in his doctrine, merits, and Spirit for the support of the spiritual life, health, and strength of believers. This is set forth at large, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed....">John 6:27-58</a>. There was also in this first tabernacle the golden altar of incense placed at the west end of it, where the veil opened into the most holy place. On this incense was burned every morning and evening, emblematical doubtless of the prayers of God’s people, and especially of the efficacy given to them by the mediation and intercession of Christ.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 The apostle shows to the Hebrews the typical reference of their ceremonies to Christ. The tabernacle was a movable temple, shadowing forth the unsettled state of the church upon earth, and the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily. The typical meaning of these things has been shown in former remarks, and the ordinances and articles of the Mosaic covenant point out Christ as our Light, and as the Bread of life to our souls; and remind us of his Divine Person, his holy priesthood, perfect righteousness, and all-prevailing intercession. Thus was the Lord Jesus Christ, all and in all, from the beginning. And as interpreted by the gospel, these things are a glorious representation of the wisdom of God, and confirm faith in Him who was prefigured by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there was a tabernacle made - The word "tabernacle" properly means a tent, a booth, or a hut, and was then given by way of eminence to the tent for public worship made by Moses in the wilderness. For a description of this, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26</a>. In this place the word means the "outer sanctuary" or "room" in the tabernacle; that is, the "first" room which was entered - called here "the first." The same word - &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;  ske&#772;ne&#772; - is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-3.htm">Hebrews 9:3</a> to denote the "inner" sanctuary, or holy of holies. The tabernacle, like the temple afterward, was divided into two parts by the veil <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>, one of which was called "the holy place," and the other "the holy of holies." The exact size of the two rooms in the tabernacle is not specified in the Scriptures, but it is commonly supposed that the tabernacle was divided in the same manner as the temple was afterward; that is, two-thirds of the interior constituted the holy place, and one-third the holy of holies. According to this, the holy place, or "first tabernacle" was twenty cubits long by ten broad, and the most holy place was ten cubits square. The whole length of the tabernacle was about fifty-five feet, the breadth eighteen, and the height eighteen. In the temple, the two rooms, though of the same relative proportions, were of course much larger. See a description of the temple in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>. In both cases, the holy place was at the east, and the Holy of Holies at the west end of the sacred edifice.<p>The first - The first room on entering the sacred edifice, here called the "first tabernacle." The apostle proceeds now to enumerate the various articles of furniture which were in the two rooms of the tabernacle and temple. His object seems to be, not for information, for it could not be supposed that they to whom he was writing were ignorant on this point, but partly to show that it could not be said that he spoke of that of which he had no information, or that he undervalued it; and partly to show the real nature of the institution, and to prove that it was of an imperfect and typical character, and had a designed reference to something that was to come. It is remarkable that though he maintains that the whole institution was a "figure" of what was to come, and though he specifies by name all the furniture of the tabernacle, he does not attempt to explain their particular typical character, nor does he affirm that they had such a character.<p>He does not say that the candlestick, and the table of show-bread, and the ark, and the cherubim were designed to adumbrate some particular truth or fact of the future dispensation, or had a designed spiritual meaning. It would have been happy if all expositors had followed the example of Paul, and had been content, as he was, to state the facts about the tabernacle, and the general truth that the dispensation was intended to introduce a more perfect economy, without endeavoring to explain the typical import of every pin and pillar of the ancient place of worship. If those things had such a designed typical reference, it is remarkable that Paul did not go into an explanation of that fact in the Epistle before us. Never could a better opportunity for doing it occur than was furnished here. Yet it was not done. Paul is silent where many expositors have found occasion for admiration. Where they have seen the profoundest wisdom, he saw none; where they have found spiritual instruction in the various implements of divine service in the sanctuary, he found none.<p>Why should we be more wise than he was? Why attempt to hunt for types and shadows where he found none? And why should we not be limited to the views which he actually expressed in regard to the design and import of the ancient dispensation? Following an inspired example we are on solid ground, and are not in danger. But the moment we leave that, and attempt to spiritualize everything in the ancient economy, we are in an open sea without compass or chart, and no one knows to what fairy lands he may be drifted. As there are frequent allusions in the New Testament to the different parts of the tabernacle furniture here specified, it may be a matter of interest and profit to furnish an illustration of the most material of them.<p>(Without attempting to explain the typical import of every pin and pillar of the tabernacle, one may be excused for thinking, that such prominent parts of its furniture, as the ark, the candlestick, and the cherubim, were designed as types. Nor can it be wrong to inquire into the spiritual significancy of them, under such guidance as the light of Scripture, here or affords elsewhere. This has been done by a host of most sober and learned commentators. It is of no use to allege, that the apostle himself has given no particular explanation of these matters, since this would have kept him back too long from his main object; and is, therefore, expressly declined by him. "Yet," says McLean, his manner of declining it implies, that each of these sacred utensils had a mystical signification. They were all constructed according to particular divine directions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>. The apostle terms them, "the example and shadow of heavenly things," <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; "the patterns of things in the heavens, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-23.htm">Hebrews 9:23</a>; and these typical patterns included not only the tabernacle and its services, but every article of its furniture, as is plain from the words of Moses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>. There are also other passages which seem to allude to, and even to explain, some of these articles, such as the golden candlestick, with its seven lamps, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12-13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; the golden censer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>; the vail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>; the mercy-seat, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; and, perhaps, the angelic cherubim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>." It must, however, be acknowledged that too great care and caution cannot be used in investigating such subjects.)<p>The candlestick - For an account of the candlestick, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-37</a>. It was made of pure gold, and had seven branches, that is, three on each side and one in the center. These branches had on the extremities seven golden lamps, which were fed with pure olive oil, and which were lighted "to give light over against it;" that is, they shed light on the altar of incense, the table of show-bread, and generally on the furniture of the holy place. These branches were made with three "bowls," "knops," and "flowers" occurring alternately on each one of the six branches; while on the center or upright shaft there were four "bowls," "knops" and "flowers" of this kind. These ornaments were probably taken from the almond, and represented the flower of that tree in various stages. The "bowls" on the branches of the candlestick probably meant the calyx or cup of that plant from which the flower springs.<p>The "knops" probably referred to some ornament on the candlestick mingled with the "bowls" and the "flowers," perhaps designed as an imitation of the nut or fruit of the almond. The "flowers" were evidently ornaments resembling the flowers on the almond-tree, wrought, as all the rest were, in pure gold. See Bush's notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>. The candlestick was undoubtedly designed to furnish light in the dark room of the tabernacle and temple; and in accordance with the general plan of those edifices, was ornamented after the most chaste and pure views of ornamental architecture of those times - but there is no evidence that its branches, and bowls, and knops, and flowers each had a special typical significance.  The sacred writers are wholly silent as to any such reference, and it is not well to attempt to be "wise above that which is written." An expositor of the Scripture cannot have a safer guide than the sacred writers themselves.<p>How should any uninspired man know that these things had such a special typical signification? The candlestick was placed on the south, or lefthand side of the holy place as one entered, the row of lamps being probably parallel with the wall. It was at first placed in the tabernacle, and afterward removed into the temple built by Solomon. Its subsequent history is unknown. Probably it was destroyed when the temple was taken by the Chaldeans. The form of the candlestick in the second temple, whose figure is preserved on the "Arch of Titus" in Rome, was of somewhat different construction. But it is to be remembered that the articles taken away from the temple by Vespasian were not the same as those made by Moses, and Josephus says expressly that the candlestick was altered from its original form.<p>And the table - That is, the table on which the showbread was placed. This table was made of shittim-wood, overlaid with gold. It was two cubits long, and one cubit broad, and a cubit and a half high; that is, about three feet and a half in length, one foot and nine inches wide, and two feet and a half in height. It was furnished with rings or staples, through which were passed staves, by which it was carried. These staves, we are informed by Josephus, were removed when the table was at rest, so that they might not be in the way of the priest as they officiated in the tabernacle. It stood lengthwise east and west, on the north side of the holy place.<p>And the show-bread - On the table just described. This bread consisted of twelve loaves, placed on the table, every Sabbath. The Hebrews affirm that they were square loaves, having the four sides covered with leaves of gold. They were arranged in two piles, of course with six in a pile; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>. The number twelve was selected with reference to the twelve tribes of Israel. They were made without leaven; were renewed each Sabbath, when the old loaves were then taken away to be eaten by the priests only. The Hebrew phrase rendered "show-bread" means properly "bread of faces," or "bread of presence." The Septuagint render it &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  artous eno&#772;pious - foreplaced loaves. In the New Testament it is, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  he&#772; prothesis to&#772;n arto&#772;n - "the placing of bread;" and in Symmachus, "bread of proposition," or placing. Why it was called "bread of presence" has been a subject on which expositors have been much divided.<p>Some have held that it was because it was "before," or in the presence of the symbol of the divine presence in the tabernacle, though in another department; some that it was because it was set there to be seen by people, rather than to be seen by God. Others that it had an emblematic design, looking forward to the Messiah as the food or nourishment of the soul, and was substantially the same as the table spread with the symbols of the Saviour's body and blood. See Bush, in loc. But of this last-mentioned opinion, it may be asked where is the proof? It is not found in the account of it in the Old Testament, and there is not the slightest intimation in the New Testament that it had any such design. The object for which it was placed there can be only a matter of conjecture, as it is not explained in the Bible, and it is more difficult to ascertain the use and design of the show-bread than of almost any other emblem of the Jewish economy."<p>Calmet. Perhaps the true idea, after all that has been written and conjectured is, that the table and the bread were for the sake of carrying out the idea that the tabernacle was the dwelling-place of God, and that there was a propriety that it should be prepared with the usual appurtenances of a dwelling. Hence, there was a candlestick and a table, because these were the common and ordinary furniture of a room; and the idea was to be kept up constantly that that was the dwelling-place of the Most High by lighting and trimming the lamps every day, and by renewing the bread on the table periodically. The most simple explanation of the phrase "bread of faces," or "bread of presence" is, that it was so called because it was set before the "face" or in the "presence" of God in the tabernacle. The various forms which it has been supposed would represent the table of showbread may be seen in Calmet's Large Dictionary. The Jews say that they were separated by plates of gold.<p>Which is called the sanctuary - Margin, "Or, holy." That is, "the holy place." The name sanctuary was commonly given to the whole edifice, but with strict propriety appertained only to this first room. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

By the direction of Moses, according to the pattern showed him in the Mount: <p>the first; that is, the first part of the tabernacle, called the holy place, in distinction from the holy of holies, which was the second part of the tabernacle; for otherwise there were not a first and a second tabernacle; there never was but one tabernacle: <p>wherein was the candlestick; that this was in the tabernacle, and on the south side of it, and without the vail, where the apostle has placed it, is plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>. This was wanting in the second temple (o): it was a type of Christ mystical, or the church; in the general use of it, to hold forth light, so the church holds forth the light of the Gospel, being put into it by Christ; in the matter of it, which was pure gold, denoting the purity, worth, splendour, glory, and duration of the church; in the parts of it, it had one shaft in the middle of it, in which all the parts met and cemented, typical of Christ the principal, and head of the church, whose situation is in the midst of the church, and who unites all together, and is but one: the six branches of it may intend all the members of the church, and especially the ministers of the word; the seven lamps with oil in them, may have a respect to the seven spirits of God, or the Spirit of God with his gifts and graces, and a profession of religion with grace along with it: and it was typical of the church in its ornaments and decorations; its bowls, knops, and flowers, may signify the various gifts of the Spirit, beautifying ministers, and fitting them for usefulness; and in the appurtenances of it, the tongs and snuff dishes may signify church discipline, censures, and excommunications. <p>And the table and the shewbread; the table, with the shewbread on it, was also in the tabernacle, on the north side of it, and without the vail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>. This was also wanting in the second temple (p): the table was typical of Christ, and of communion with him; of the person of Christ; in the matter of it, which was Shittim wood overlaid with gold, whereby were signified the two natures of Christ in one person; the human nature by the Shittim wood, which is incorruptible, for though he died he saw no corruption, and is risen again, and lives for ever; and the divine nature by the gold, all the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him; and in the decorations of it, as the border, golden crown, &amp;c. which may respect the fulness of his grace, and the honour and glory he is crowned with, which render him exceeding valuable and precious: and it may be typical of communion with him, either hereafter, when the saints shall sit with him as at a table, and eat and drink with him in the kingdom of his Father; or here, to which Christ admits them, and than which nothing is more honourable, comfortable, and desirable; and it may be significative of the ministration of the word and ordinances, of which Christ is the sum and substance, and in which he grants his people fellowship with him: to this table belonged rings and bars to carry it from place to place, which was done by the priests; where the church is, there Christ is, and there is the ministration of his word and ordinances; and which are sometimes moved from one place to another, by the ministers of the word, according to divine direction. The "shewbread", on the table, was typical either of the church of Christ, the saints, who may be signified by the unleavened cakes, being true and sincere, and without the leaven of malice and hypocrisy; and by twelve of them, which may represent the twelve tribes of Israel, the whole spiritual Israel of God; and by bread of faces, as the word for shewbread may be rendered, since they are always before the Lord, and his eyes are continually upon them; they are set upon the pure table, Christ, on whom they are safe, and by whom they are accepted with God: and the shewbread being set in rows, may denote their order and harmony; and their being removed every sabbath day, may signify the succession of saints in the church, as one is removed, another is brought in; and the frankincense put upon each row, shows them to be a sweet savour to God: or else the shewbread was typical of Christ himself, who is the bread of life, the food of his people; and may be signified by the shewbread for its fineness and purity, being made of fine flour, Christ is the finest of the wheat, bread from heaven, and angels' food; for its quantity, twelve cakes, with Christ, is bread enough, and to spare, for all the elect; for its continuance, Christ always abides, and such as feed upon him live for ever; for its gratefulness, Christ's flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed; and for its being only for the priests, as only such who are made priests to God, live by faith on Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5</a>. Moreover, the intercession of Christ may be prefigured by the shewbread, or bread of faces, he being the angel of God's presence or face, who appears in the presence of God for his people; and this consisting of twelve loaves, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, shows that Christ represents the whole Israel of God in heaven, and intercedes for them; and whereas the shewbread always continued, no sooner was one set of loaves removed, but another was put in their room; this may point at the continual intercession of Christ for his people; and the frankincense may denote the acceptableness of it to God. <p>Which is called the sanctuary; or "holy"; this refers either to the first part of the tabernacle, which was called the holy place, in which the priests in common ministered; or else to the things which were in it, now mentioned, the candlestick table, and shewbread; to which the Ethiopic version adds, and the golden censer, which it leaves out in the fourth verse; which version renders these words, "and these they call holy"; and so the Arabic version, "which are called holy things", as they were, as well as the place in which they were; so the candlestick is called the holy candlestick in the Apocrypha, <p>"As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age.'' (Sirach 26:17) <p>and the ark, candlestick, table, censer, and altar, are called  "holy vessels", by Philo the Jew (q); but the former sense seems best, when compared with the following verse. <p>(o) T.

The ark had been removed or destroyed in the sack by the Chaldeans, and was never replaced (for the Jewish tradition on the subject, see 2 Macc. 2:1-8). Josephus says ('Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. 5) that in the temple of his day there was nothing whatever behind the veil in the holy of holies; and Tacitus informs us ('Hist.,' v 9) that, when Pompey entered the temple, he found there "vacuam sedem et inania arcana." A stone basement is said by the rabbis to have occupied the ark's place, called "lapis fundationis." In the "first tabernacle," called "the holy place" (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> probably, not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a neuter plural, equivalent to "the holies"), the table of shewbread (with its twelve loaves in two rows, changed weekly) stood on the north side, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the right as one approached the veil; and opposite to it, on the left, the seven-branched golden candlestick, or lamp-stand, carrying an oil-lamp on each branch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 37, 40</a>.). Between them, close to the veil stood the golden altar of incense (ibid.); which, nevertheless, is not mentioned here as part of the furniture of the "first tabernacle," being associated with the "second," for reasons which will be seen. The "second veil" was that between the holy place and the holy of holies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-35.htm">Exodus 36:35</a>), the curtain at the entrance of the holy place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-37.htm">Exodus 36:37</a>) being regarded as the first. The inner sanctuary behind this second veil is spoken of as <span class="accented">having</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) in the first place "a golden <span class="accented">censer</span>," as the word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is translated in the A.V. (so also in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">thuribulum</span>). But it assuredly means the" golden altar of incense," though this stood locally outside the veil. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> otherwise there would be no mention at all of this altar, which was so important in the symbolism of the tabernacle, and so prominent in the Pentateuch, from which the whole description is taken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The alternative view of its being a censer reserved for the use of the high priest, when he entered behind the veil on the Day of Atonement, has no support from the Pentateuch, in which no such censer is mentioned as part of the standing furniture of the tabernacle, and none of <span class="accented">gold is</span> spoken of at all; nor, had it been so, would it have been placed, any more than the altar of incense, <span class="accented">within</span> the veil, since the high priest required it <span class="accented">before</span> he entered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Though the word itself, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, certainly means" censer," and not "altar of incense," in the LXX., yet in the Hellenistic writers it is otherwise. Philo and Josephus, and also Clemens Alexandrinus and Origen, always call the altar of incense <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>; and the language of the Epistle is Hellenistic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The wording does not of necessity imply that what is spoken of was locally <span class="accented">within</span> the veil: it is not said (as where the actual <span class="accented">contents</span> of the "first tabernacle" and of the ark are spoken <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented">wherein</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>), but <span class="accented">having</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), which need only mean <span class="accented">having as belonging to it</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> connected with its symbolism. It was an appendage to the holy of holies, though not actually inside it, in the same way (to use a homely illustration given by Delitzsch) as the sign-board of a shop belongs to the shop and not to the street. It is, indeed, so regarded in the Old Testament. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>, "Before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>, "The altar which was <span class="accented">by</span> the oracle," or, "<span class="accented">belonging to</span> the oracle;" cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>, where, in the visions of the heavenly temple based upon the symbolism of the earthly, the altar of incense is associated with the Divine throne. And it was also so associated in the ceremonial of the tabernacle. The smoke of the incense daily offered on it was supposed to penetrate the veil to the holy of holies, representing the sweet savor of intercession before the mercy-seat itself; and on the Day of Atonement, not only was its incense taken by the high priest within the veil, but also it, as well as the mercy-seat, was sprinkled with the atoning blood. Of the rest of the things described as belonging to the holy of holies, it is to be observed that, though none of them were in it when the Epistle was written, yet all (except the pot of manna and Aaron's rod) were essential to its significance, as will be seen; and all, with these two exceptions, were in Solomon's temple as well as in the original tabernacle. An objection that has been raised to the accuracy of the description, on the ground that the pot and the rod are not said in the Pentateuch to have been placed <span class="accented">inside</span> the ark, is groundless. They were to be laid up "before the LORD" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>); "before the testimony" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>); and "the testimony" elsewhere means the tables of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>, etc.), which were within the ark. It was most likely that they would be kept for safe preservation in the same place with the" testimony," <span class="accented">before</span> which they were ever to be. Further, what is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-10.htm">2 Chronicles 5:10</a>) of there being nothing in the ark but the two tables of stone when it was moved into Solomon's temple, is no proof that nothing else had been originally there. It seems, indeed, rather to favor the idea that there had been, as implying that something more might have been expected to be found there. The mercy-seat, as is well known, was the cover of the ark, over which the wings of the two cherubim were spread. The expression, "cherubim of glory," probably has reference to the luminous cloud, significant of the Divine presence, which, occasionally at least (there is no sufficient ground for concluding it to have been a permanent manifestation), is said to have been seen above them. The cherubim, whatever their exact significance, are represented as accompaniments of the Divine glory (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and 10.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Was made (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3</a>.<p>The first<p>The first tabernacle, that is, the first division of the tabernacle.
