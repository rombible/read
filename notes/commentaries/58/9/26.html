The writer’s point of view is the time when “Christ entered into heaven itself.” In speaking of the repeated “suffering” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm" title="Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?">Luke 24:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-46.htm" title="And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:">Luke 24:46</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>he marks the limits within which it must lie, reaching back to the “foundation of the world.” The expression in the second part of the verse is the converse of this: looking forward from the “foundation of the world,” through all the successive periods of human history until the Incarnation, he writes, “Now once at the end of the world”—“at the consummation of the ages”—hath Christ “been manifested.” The words “consummation of the age” occur <span class= "ital">five</span> times in St. Matthew’s Gospel—<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-39.htm" title="The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.">Matthew 13:39-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-49.htm" title="So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,">Matthew 13:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>. (See the Notes.) The phrase here is more expressive still. The history of all preceding ages was a preparation for the manifestation of the Christ (“who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times” (literally, <span class= "ital">at the end of the times</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>; all subsequent history develops the results of that manifestation. A similar thought is contained in St. Paul’s words “the fulness of the seasons” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), “the fulness of the time” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>). (See further the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">for the annulling of sin through His sacrifice.</span> The word which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.">Hebrews 7:18</a> was used for the abrogation of the command relating to the line of earthly priests, is here applied to the destruction of the power and abolition of the results of sin. As in the manifestation before the face of God we see the proof that the goal which the human high priest failed to reach had been attained, so these words proclaim full deliverance from guilt and penalty, and from the hold of sin itself—a deliverance which the sin-offering could but express in figure.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:23-28 It is evident that the sacrifices of Christ are infinitely better than those of the law, which could neither procure pardon for sin, nor impart power against it. Sin would still have been upon us, and have had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyed the works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, and happy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep one of the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises or neglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemer liveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience of the church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayer as the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For then must he often have suffered - That is, if his blood had no more efficacy than what the Jewish high priest offered, and which was so often repeated, it would have been necessary that Christ should have often died.<p>But now once - Once for all; once in the sense that it is not to be repeated again - &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;  hapax.<p>In the end of the world - In the last dispensation or economy; that under which the affairs of the world will be wound up; see the phrase fully explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>.<p>Hath he appeared - He has been manifested in human form.<p>To put away sin - <p>(1) To remove the punishment due to sin, or to provide a way of pardon; and,<p>(2) to remove the stain of sin from the soul; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>.<p>By the sacrifice of himself - see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. then&#8212;in that case.<p>must &#8230; have suffered&#8212;rather as Greek, "It would have been necessary for Him often to suffer." In order to "offer" (Heb 9:25), or present Himself often before God in the heavenly holiest place, like the legal high priests making fresh renewals of this high priestly function. He would have had, and would have often to suffer. His oblation of Himself before God was once for all (that is, the bringing in of His blood into the heavenly Holy of Holies), and therefore the preliminary suffering was once for all.<p>since the foundation of the world&#8212;The continued sins of men, from their first creation, would entail a continual suffering on earth, and consequent oblation of His blood in the heavenly holiest place, since the foundation of the world, if the one oblation "in the fulness of time" were not sufficient. Philo [The Creation of the World, p. 637], shows that the high priest of the Hebrews offered sacrifices for the whole human race. "If there had been greater efficacy in the repetition of the oblation, Christ necessarily would not have been so long promised, but would have been sent immediately after the foundation of the world to suffer, and offer Himself at successive periods" [Grotius].<p>now&#8212;as the case is,<p>once&#8212;for all; without need of renewal. Rome's fiction of an UNBLOODY sacrifice in the mass, contradicts her assertion that the blood of Christ is present in the wine; and also confutes her assertion that the mass is propitiatory; for, if unbloody, it cannot be propitiatory; for without shedding of blood there is no remission (Heb 9:22). Moreover, the expression "once" for all here, and in Heb 9:28, and Heb 10:10, 12, proves the falsity of her view that there is a continually repeated offering of Christ in the Eucharist or mass. The offering of Christ was a thing once done that it might be thought of for ever (compare Note, see on [2572]Heb 10:12).<p>in the end of the world&#8212;Greek, "at the consummation of the ages"; the winding up of all the previous ages from the foundation of the world; to be followed by a new age (Heb 1:1, 2). The last age, beyond which no further age is to be expected before Christ's speedy second coming, which is the complement of the first coming; literally, "the ends of the ages"; Mt 28:20 is literally, "the consummation of the age," or world (singular; not as here, plural, ages). Compare "the fulness of times," Eph 1:10.<p>appeared&#8212;Greek, "been manifested" on earth (1Ti 3:16; 1Pe 1:20). English Version has confounded three distinct Greek verbs, by translating all alike, Heb 9:24, 26, 28, "appear." But, in Heb 9:24, it is "to present Himself," namely, before God in the heavenly sanctuary; in Heb 9:26, "been manifested" on earth: in Heb 9:28, "shall be seen" by all, and especially believers.<p>put away&#8212;abolish; doing away sin's power as well by delivering men from its guilt and penalty, so that it should be powerless to condemn men, as also from its yoke, so that they shall at last sin no more.<p>sin&#8212;singular number; all the sins of men of every age are regarded as one mass laid on Christ. He hath not only droned for all actual sins, but destroyed sin itself. Joh 1:29, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin (not merely the sins: singular, not plural) of the world."<p>by the sacrifice of himself&#8212;Greek, "by (through) His own sacrifice"; not by "blood of others" (Heb 9:25).

For if it was necessary that he should often offer up himself now, which is the same as to suffer, since the sacrifice of himself, the same was necessary before; seeing sin was in the world from the beginning, and the saints from the foundation of the world had their sins expiated by the sacrifice of Christ; but the truth is, Christ's sufferings were but once, though the virtue of them is always, both before and after; nor can he suffer more, or again, because of his power over death and the grave, and because he has effectually obtained what he suffered for: <p>but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself; this is to be understood, not of his appearance in heaven, of which mention is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a> but of his incarnation on earth, called an appearance; not as though his human nature was a mere phantom or apparition, for it was a real thing; or as if he was then manifested to be what he really was before; for before his incarnation he was not truly and actually man; but this is said with respect to the manifestation of his invisible deity; or of him as the Son of God in human nature; and in regard to the types of the old law, under which he was hid; and with respect to the prophecies of his coming; and it designs the same thing with his descent from heaven, and coming into this world, in which he appeared in fashion as a man, as a mean man, as an afflicted one; yea, he looked like a sinful man, bearing the infirmities and sins of his people; his appearance was but to a very few, and for a little time; and the time of it was, "in the end of the world"; the same with the last days; the last age of the world; the end of the Jewish economy; at the close of their civil and ecclesiastical state, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> &amp; so the Jews expect their Messiah , "at the end of days" (n): and this appearance was but "once"; there were many appearances of him in an human form, under the Old Testament dispensation; and there were many after his resurrection; but this is said to be but once, in opposition to the many types and sacrifices under the law, and agrees with his one oblation, and once suffering: the end of his appearance was, to put away sin; the filth of it, by his blood; the guilt of it, by his atoning sacrifice; and the punishment of it, by his sufferings and death, the penalty of the law; and in consequence of all this, the dominion of it by the power of his grace, and the very being of it hereafter: and this putting it away is signified by his bearing, carrying, and taking it away; by removing it as far as the east is from the west; by finishing and making an end of it; by crucifying the old man, destroying the body of sin, and by an utter disannulling and abolishing it, as a debt, and as a law; and all this is done by the sacrifice of himself; by the offering up of his body and soul an offering for sin; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>. <p>(n) Seder Tephillot, Ed.

But a man can die only once: therefore Christ's sacrifice which was once done in the later days, neither could nor can be repeated.

Proof of the necessity that Christ’s sacrifice should take place only once for all, from the non-reasonableness of the opposite. For if the sacrifice of Christ sufficed not once for all for the cancelling of sin, He must oftentimes in succession—because no generation of mankind, so long as the world has endured, has been free from sin—have undergone death since the beginning of the world. But now, seeing this is contrary to reason, the matter stands in reality quite otherwise.
