The “offering “which is here in thought does not correspond to the actual sacrifice of the sin-offerings on the Day of Atonement, but to the presentation of the blood in the Holiest Place. In this really consisted the presentation of that sacrifice to God. That this is the meaning here is shown by the contrast in the latter part of the verse, where we read of the high priest’s entering the Holy Place (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Holy of Holies; see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2</a>) “with blood not his own,” and by the argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:23-28 It is evident that the sacrifices of Christ are infinitely better than those of the law, which could neither procure pardon for sin, nor impart power against it. Sin would still have been upon us, and have had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyed the works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, and happy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep one of the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises or neglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemer liveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience of the church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayer as the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nor yet that he should offer himself often - The Jewish high priest entered the most holy place with blood once every year.

The sequence of the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> clause after <span class="greekheb">εἰσῆλθεν</span>; the analogy presented in the clause under <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ</span>; and the consequence stated under <span class="greekheb">ἐπεὶ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>) all combine in favouring this meaning. The High Priest enters the Holiest annually, but Christ’s entering in was of another kind, not requiring repetition. The reason for the reiterated entering in of the High Priest, as well as the possibility of it, is given in the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν αἵματι ἀλλοτρίῳ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>: “The High Priest was, as it were, surrounded, enveloped, in the life sacrificed and symbolically communicated” (Westcott). It is safer to take <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> in its common instrumental sense: the blood was the instrument which enabled the High Priest to enter. The reason why the entrance had to be annually renewed is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-4.htm" title="For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.">Hebrews 10:4</a>. The same contrast between <span class="greekheb">αἷμα ἀλλότριον</span> and <span class="greekheb">αἶμα ἴδιον</span> is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>. A sacrifice of blood not one’s own is necessarily imperfect, Christ’s entrance to God being <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ ἰδίου αἵματος</span> and <span class="greekheb">διὰ πνεύματος αἰωνίου</span> had eternal efficacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">entereth into the holy place every year</span>] In this entrance of the High Priest once a year, on the Day of Atonement, into the Holiest Place culminated all that was gorgeous and awe-inspiring in the Jewish ritual. The writer therefore purposely chose it as his point of comparison between the ministrations of the Two Covenants. For if he could shew that even the ceremonies of this day—called by the Jews “<span class="ital">the</span> Day”—were a nullity compared with the significance of the Gospel, he was well aware that no other rite would be likely to make a converted Hebrew waver in his faith. The Day of Atonement was called “the Sabbath of Sabbatism” or “perfect Sabbath.” It was the <span class="ital">one</span> fast-day of the Jewish Calendar. The 70 bullocks offered during the Atonement-week were regarded as a propitiation for all the 70 nations of the world. On that day the very Angels were supposed to tremble. It was the only day on which perfect pardon could be assured to sins which had been repented of. On that day alone Satan had no power to accuse, which is inferred by “<span class="ital">Gematria</span>” from the fact that “<span class="ital">the Accuser</span>” in Hebrew was numerically equivalent to 364, so that on the 365th day of the year he was forced to be silent. On the seven days before the day of Atonement the High Priest was scrupulously secluded, and was kept awake all the preceding night to avoid the chance of ceremonial defilement. Till the last 40 years before the Fall of Jerusalem it was asserted that the tongue of scarlet cloth tied round the neck of the goat “for Azazel” (“the Scape Goat”) used to turn white in token of the Remission of Sins. The function of the High Priest was believed to be attended with much peril, and the people awaited his reappearance with deep anxiety. The awful impression made by the services of the day is shewn by the legends which grew up respecting them, and by such passages as <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/50-5.htm" title="How was he honoured in the midst of the people in his coming out of the sanctuary!...">Sir 50:5-16</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/45-6.htm" title="He exalted Aaron, an holy man like unto him, even his brother, of the tribe of Levi....">Sir 45:6-22</a>. See an Excursus on this subject in my <span class="ital">Early Days of Christianity</span>, ii. 549–552.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with blood of others</span>] Namely of the goat and the bullock. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a>. A Rabbinic book says “Abraham was Circumcised on the Day of Atonement; and on that Day God annually looks on the blood of the Covenant of the Circumcision as atoning for all our iniquities.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐδʼ ἵνα</span>) He did <span class="ital">not</span> enter for this purpose, viz. <span class="ital">that</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> blood not his own, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>); <span class="cmt_word">for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now</span> (probably <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, meaning "as it is ") <span class="cmt_word">once at the end of the ages hath he appeared</span> (rather, <span class="accented">been manifested</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span> Here (as above noted) the idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> in ver. 12 is taken up. That Christ's offering of himself is once for all, needing no repetition, follows from the view of it already given, viz. that it is a perpetual presentation of himself, after fully availing sacrifice of himself, before the very face of God. That this is of necessity once for all is now further shown by the consideration that repeated offerings of himself would involve the impossible condition of repeated deaths. Observe that "offer himself" in ver. 25 does not refer to the death upon the cross, but to the intercession before the eternal mercy-seat after accomplished atonement, answering to the high priest's entrance, with the blood of previous sacrifice, within the veil. The death itself is denoted in ver. 26 by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ("suffered"). The argument rests on the principle, already established as being signified by the whole of the ancient ritual, that, for acceptable intercession in behalf of man, previous death or blood-shedding is in every case required. But why add "since the foundation of the world"? We must supply the thought of the retrospective efficacy of Christ's atonement. Ever since sin entered, man needed atonement, signified, but not effected, by the ancient sacrifices. Christ's one offering of himself has supplied this primeval need, availing, not only for the present and future, but also for all past ages. This view was definitely expressed, with reference to "transgressions which were under the first covenant," in ver. 15, and, though not repeated here, is prominent in the writer's mind (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>, where God's righteousness is said to have been shown in Christ with regard to "the passing over of sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God," as well as to justification of believers now; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>, where the effect of Christ's obedience is declared to be coextensive with that of Adam's transgression). This view accounts for "since the foundation of the world," the idea being that, the transgressions requiring atonement having been since then, repeated deaths since then would have been needed had not Christ's one offering of himself availed for all time, just as repeated sacrifices were needed for the high priest's symbolical yearly intercessions. The question is not asked, nor is any reason given, why this one all-sufficient offering was deferred till so long after the need began. It is enough to know that such has been, in fact, the Divine will, viz. that not till the fullness of time was come - not till the end (or consummation) of the long preceding sinful ages - should the Redeemer once for all be manifested for atonement. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, seems certainly to imply the idea, otherwise known to have been prevalent in the apostolic age, of the end of all things being close at hand; and this expectation further accounts for the reference to the past rather than the future in the expression, "since the foundation of the world." For, with regard to the future, the second coming of Christ was the one great idea present to the minds of Christians, the intervening time being regarded by them as but the dawn of coming day (see, on this head, what was said under Hebrews 1:2). The strong expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (for the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18</a>, where it means "abrogation"), used as it here is with reference to all the transgressions of the ages past, though not to be pressed so as to invalidate what is elsewhere said of the future penal consequences of all willful and unrepented sin, may still be cited among the texts supporting the view of those who "trust the larger hope." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Nor yet that (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b4;' &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)<p>Supply did he enter.

Offer himself refers rather to Christ's entrance into the heavenly sanctuary and presentation of himself before God, than to his offering on the cross. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>. The sacrifice on the cross is described by &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; suffer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>, and is introduced as a distinct thought. The point is that, being once in the heavenly sanctuary, Christ was not compelled to renew often his presentation of himself there, since, in that case, it would be necessary for him to suffer often. Each separate offering would necessitate a corresponding suffering. </body></html>
