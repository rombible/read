There are three passages of the Epistle which must be kept together—<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-15.htm" title="And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.">Hebrews 6:15</a>, “And so, having patiently waited, he (Abraham) obtained the promise;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm" title="For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.">Hebrews 10:36</a>, “Ye have need of endurance, that having done the will of God ye may receive the promise;” and the present versa. To the saints of the Old Testament the promised blessing was future; they obtained it, but not within the limits of this present life. To us the promised blessing is present, revealed to us in its true nature, obtained for us once for all; for we know that eternal redemption has been won through Christ’s entering for us once for all into the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>), and to us the “perfection” has come, in that through Him we “draw near to God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>).

The expression does not imply that all the Israelitish judges, captains, and other worthies mentioned in this chapter, as well as the ancients, were truly righteous persons, justified by their faith, and made heirs of eternal salvation; for the apostle’s design in this part of his epistle being to show, by examples from the Jewish Scriptures, the influence which faith in the divine revelations and promises hath to excite men to perform those difficult and dangerous enterprises which he assigns to them in particular, the witness which was borne to some of them means only the praise which was given to them in Scripture on account of the faith which they showed in performing these particular great actions. <span class="ital">Received not the promise </span>— The great promised blessings, namely, Christ the promised seed, come in the flesh, as the accomplishment of all the types and shadows, whether of the Mosaic or the patriarchal dispensation. They received the promise that the Messiah should come, as is said of Abraham, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-17.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,">Hebrews 11:17</a>,) but did not receive the accomplishment of it. This the apostle positively asserts; but that the Christians in his days had received it, as is signified <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a>. “It is therefore not only untrue and unsafe,” as Dr. Owen observes, “but contrary to the fundamental principles of our religion, the faith of Christians in all ages, and the design of the apostle in this whole epistle, to interpret this promise, as some do, of any thing but the coming of Christ in the flesh, of his accomplishment of the work of our redemption, with the unspeakable privileges and advantages that the church hath received thereby. That this promise was made to the elders from the beginning of the world, that it was not actually accomplished to them, being necessarily confined to one season, called <span class="ital">the fulness of time, </span>and that herein lies the great difference of the two states of the church, that under the Old Testament and that under the New, with the prerogative of the latter above the former, are such weighty sacred truths, that without an acknowledgment of them no important doctrine, either of the Old Testament or of the New, can be rightly understood. This then was the state of believers under the Old Testament; they had the promise of the exhibition of Christ, the Son of God, in the flesh, for the redemption of the church; this promise they <span class="ital">received, </span>saw <span class="ital">afar off, </span>as to its actual accomplishment, were <span class="ital">persuaded </span>of the truth of it, and <span class="ital">embraced </span>it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a>. The actual accomplishment of it they desired, longed for, and looked after, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-24.htm" title="For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.">Luke 10:24</a>,) inquiring diligently into the grace of God contained therein, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow....">1 Peter 1:11-13</a>. Hereby they enjoyed the benefits of it, even as we do; yet they received not its actual accomplishment in the coming of Christ, the reason of which the apostle gives in the next verse.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:39,40 The world considers that the righteous are not worthy to live in the world, and God declares the world is not worthy of them. Though the righteous and the worldlings widely differ in their judgment, they agree in this, it is not fit that good men should have their rest in this world. Therefore God receives them out of it. The apostle tells the Hebrews, that God had provided some better things for them, therefore they might be sure that he expected as good things from them. As our advantages, with the better things God has provided for us, are so much beyond theirs, so should our obedience of faith, patience of hope, and labour of love, be greater. And unless we get true faith as these believers had, they will rise up to condemn us at the last day. Let us then pray continually for the increase of our faith, that we may follow these bright examples, and be, with them, at length made perfect in holiness and happiness, and shine like the sun in the kingdom of our Father for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith - They were all commended and approved on account of their confidence in God; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-2.htm">Hebrews 11:2</a>.<p>Received not the promise - That is, did not receive the fulfillment of the promise; or did not receive all that was promised.

Though they were so, yet "they received not the promise," that is, the final completion of "salvation" promised at Christ's coming again (Heb 9:28); "the eternal inheritance" (Heb 9:15). Abraham did obtain the very thing promised (Heb 6:15) in part, namely, blessedness in soul after death, by virtue of faith in Christ about to come. The full blessedness of body and soul shall not be till the full number of the elect shall be accomplished, and all together, no one preceding the other, shall enter on the full glory and bliss. Moreover, in another point of view, "It is probable that some accumulation of blessedness was added to holy souls, when Christ came and fulfilled all things even as at His burial many rose from the dead, who doubtless ascended to heaven with Him" [Flacius in Bengel]. (Compare Note, see on [2592]Eph 4:8). The perfecting of believers in title, and in respect to conscience, took place once for all, at the death of Christ, by virtue of His being made by death perfect as Saviour. Their perfecting in soul at, and ever after Christ's death, took place, and takes place at their death. But the universal and final perfecting will not take place till Christ's coming.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle returns in this verse to the proposition laid down in the second verse, which he had been proving by all these examples, and with it shuts up the history of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And these all; </span> all these elders, mentioned from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-2.htm" title="For by it the elders obtained a good report.">Hebrews 11:2</a></span> to this verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Having obtained a good report through faith:</span> marturhyentev, strictly, is having been martyred, or made martyrs; specially witnessing to the death for Christ, have a testimony given them, by way of eminency, by God himself in his Scripture record, that through faith they pleased him in their glorious achievements and sufferings, and were God’s faithful witnesses to the world, glorifying him in it; though reproached and ruined by the world, yet they were too good to live in it, and were fit to live with him in heaven, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-2.htm" title="For by it the elders obtained a good report.">Hebrews 11:2</a>,5,16,35</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Received not the promise; </span> yet these worthies, as Abraham and his believing seed, did not possess the land of Canaan, though they had the promise of it in their time, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a></span>; others did obtain the grace and good things promised for their time, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-33.htm" title="Who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.">Hebrews 11:33</a></span>, but none of these had fulfilled to them in their day the manifestation of the Messiah in the flesh; though they saw his day and coming by faith, and did rejoice in it, yet none saw him so come as Simeon did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-26.htm" title="And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.">Luke 2:26</a>,29</span>; though, as to the eternal benefits by Christ, they did as actually receive them, as those since his perfecting the work of redemption have received them, even eternal blessedness and glory by him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-11.htm" title="But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.">Acts 15:11</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hebrews/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And these all having obtained a good report through faith,....

Now since these saints so strongly believed, and so cheerfully suffered before Christ came; the apostle's argument is, that much more should the saints now, since Christ is come, and the promises received, go on believing in him, and readily suffering for his sake; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{16}</span> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received <span class="cverse3">{y}</span> not the promise:</span><p>(16) An amplification taken from the circumstance of the time: their faith is so much the more to be marvelled at, by how much the promises of things to come were more dark, yet at length were indeed exhibited to us, so that their faith and ours is as one, as is also their consecration and ours.<p>(y) But saw Christ afar off.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/11-39.htm" title="And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:...">Hebrews 11:39-40</a>.

For though in both passages "the promise," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the great Messianic promise (not "premises," as in ver. 33, <span class="accented">supra</span>), is spoken of - or at any rate, in the case of Abraham, ultimately referred to - yet the verbs used are different and have different meanings, He "obtained" or attained to it, in the sense of having it confirmed and assured to him and his seed (see note on Hebrews 6:15); but he did not actually get it so as to reduce it to possession and enter into the enjoyment of it. The realization of all that is meant by the word here used is, indeed, even to Christian believers, still future (for cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Nay, it is future also in its fullness, even to the saints at rest; for in the passage just quoted it is plainly intimated that the entire fulfillment will not be till "he that shall come" comes; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till the second advent. The redeemed whose probation on earth is over are indeed, in one sense, said to be already "perfected" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a>); but still the "perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul" is nowhere in the New Testament contemplated till "the end." In the mean time, even the saints under the heavenly altar still cry, "Lord, how long?" and the Spirit and the bride say, "Come, Lord Jesus." The full idea, then, of ver. 40 may be that, according to the eternal Divine purpose, the promise of redemption should not be fully realized till the number of the elect shall be accomplished, and all the redeemed of all ages since the world began shall be gathered together through Christ in one, and God shall be all in all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Having obtained a good report (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Rend.
