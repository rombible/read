This is that pleasing of God which is appropriated to faith alone, and which alone shall receive an eternal reward. In a lower sense, however, there may be many acts and duties with which, as to the matter of them, God may be pleased, and which he may reward in this world without faith; as the destruction of the house of Ahab by Jehu. Enoch <span class="ital">walked with God, </span>and therefore is said to please him; that is, he set God always before him, and thought, spoke, and acted as one that considered he was always under God’s eye, and he made it his daily business to worship and serve him acceptably. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But without faith </span>— In the being, attributes, superintending providence, and grace of God; <span class="ital">it is impossible </span>— For a fallen, sinful, and weak creature, such as man is, and such as Enoch undoubtedly was; <span class="ital">to please him </span>— Though no particular revelation is mentioned as the object of Enoch’s faith, yet from Moses’s telling us that he walked with, or pleased God, it is certain that his faith in those doctrines of religion, which are discoverable by the light of nature, and which are mentioned in this verse, must have been very strong, since it led him habitually to walk with God, so as to please him; <span class="ital">for he that cometh to God </span>— In prayer, or any other act of worship, or who endeavours to serve him; <span class="ital">must believe that he is </span>— That he exists, <span class="ital">and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him </span>— And therefore, that he is wise and mighty, holy, just, and good. “By representing the existence of God and his government of the world as objects of faith, the apostle hath taught us, that the truths of natural religion are equally the objects of faith with the truths of revelation. And this doctrine is just. For the evidence by which the truths of natural religion are supported, being of the same kind with the evidence which supports the truths of revelation, namely, not demonstrative, but probable evidence, the persuasion produced by that kind of evidence in matters of natural religion, is as really <span class="ital">faith </span>as the persuasion which the same evidence produces in matters of revelation. Further, <span class="ital">the faith </span>or persuasion of the truths of natural religion which men attain, being as much the effect of attention, impartial search, and prayer, as the faith which they attain of the truths of revelation, it is as much a matter of duty, and as pleasing to God, [as far as it extends,] as faith in the truths of revelation.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:4-7 Here follow some illustrious examples of faith from the Old Testament. Abel brought a sacrifice of atonement from the firstlings of the flock, acknowledging himself a sinner who deserved to die, and only hoping for mercy through the great Sacrifice. Cain's proud rage and enmity against the accepted worshipper of God, led to the awful effects the same principles have produced in every age; the cruel persecution, and even murder of believers. By faith Abel, being dead, yet speaketh; he left an instructive and speaking example. Enoch was translated, or removed, that he should not see death; God took him into heaven, as Christ will do the saints who shall be alive at his second coming. We cannot come to God, unless we believe that he is what he has revealed himself to be in the Scripture. Those who would find God, must seek him with all their heart. Noah's faith influenced his practice; it moved him to prepare an ark. His faith condemned the unbelief of others; and his obedience condemned their contempt and rebellion. Good examples either convert sinners or condemn them. This shows how believers, being warned of God to flee from the wrath to come, are moved with fear, take refuge in Christ, and become heirs of the righteousness of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By faith Enoch was translated - The account of Enoch is found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-21.htm">Genesis 5:21-24</a>. It is very brief, and is this, that "Enoch walked with God, and was not, for God took him." There is no particular mention of his "faith," and the apostle attributes this to him, as in the case of Abel, either because it was involved in the very nature of piety, or because the fact was communicated to him by direct revelation. In the account in Genesis, there is nothing inconsistent with the belief that Enoch was characterized by eminent faith, but it is rather implied in the expression, "he walked with God." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>. It may also be implied in what is said by the apostle Jude Jde 1:14-15, that "he prophesied, saying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints," etc. From this it would appear that he was a preacher: that he predicted the coming of the Lord to judgment, and that he lived in the firm belief of what was to occur in future times. Moses does not say expressly that Enoch was translated. He says "he was not, for God took him." The expression "he was not," means he was no more among people; or he was removed from the earth. "This" language would be applicable to any method by which he was removed, whether by dying, or by being translated. A similar expression respecting Romulus occurs in Livy (i. 16), Nec deinde in terris Romulus fuit. The translation of the Septuagint on this part of the verse in Genesis is, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  ouch heurisketo - "was not found;" that is, he disappeared. The authority for what the apostle says here, that he "was translated," is found in the other phrase in Genesis, "God took him." The reasons which led to the statement that he was transported without seeing death, or that show that this is a fair conclusion from the words in Genesis, are such, as these:<p>(1) There is no mention made of his death, and in this respect the account of Enoch stands by itself. It is, except in this case, the uniform custom of Moses to mention the age and the death of the individuals whose biography he records, and in many cases this is about all that is said of them. But in regard to Enoch there is this remarkable exception that no record is made of his death - showing that there was something unusual in the manner of his removal from the world.<p>(2) the Hebrew word used by Moses, found in such a connection, is one which would rather suggest the idea that he had been taken in some extraordinary manner from the world. That word - &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;  laaqach - means "to take" - with the idea of taking "to oneself." Thus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>, "Noah took of all beasts and offered a burnt-offering." Thus, it is often used in the sense of "taking a wife" - that is, to oneself <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-19.htm">Genesis 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-19.htm">Genesis 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-14.htm">Genesis 19:14</a>; and then it is used in the sense of "taking away;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-12.htm">Genesis 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-35.htm">Genesis 27:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-20.htm">Job 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>. The word, therefore, would naturally suggest the idea that he had been taken by God to himself, or had been removed in an extraordinary manner from the earth. This is confirmed by the fact that the word is not used anywhere in the Scriptures to denote a "removal by death," and that in the only other instance in which it (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;  laaqach) is used in relation to a removal from this world, it occurs in the statement respecting the translation of Elijah. "And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel, came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the Lord "will take away" (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;  laaqach) thy master from thy head today?" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>. This transaction, where there could be no doubt about the "manner" of the removal, shows in what sense the word is used in Genesis.<p>(3) it was so understood by the translators of the Septuagint. The apostle has used the same word in this place which is employed by the Seventy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a> - &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  metatithe&#772;mi. This word means to transpose, to put in another place; and then to transport, transfer, translate; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-12.htm">Hebrews 7:12</a>. It properly expresses the removal to another place, and is the very word which would he used on the supposition that one was taken to heaven without dying.<p>(4) this interpretation of the passage in Genesis by Paul is in accordance with the uniform interpretation of the Jews. In the Targum of Onkelos it is evidently supposed that Enoch was transported without dying. In that Targum the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a> is rendered, "And Enoch walked in the fear of the Lord, and was not, for the Lord did not put him to death" - &#1500;&#1468;&#1492;  lo' - 'amiyt yityeh Yahweh. So also in Ecclesiasticus or the Son of Sirach (49:14), "But upon the earth was no man created like Enoch; for he was taken from the earth." These opinions of the Jews and of the early translators, are of value only as showing that the interpretation which Paul has put upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-2.htm">Genesis 5:2</a> is the natural interpretation. It is such as occurs to separate writers, without collusion, and thus shows that this is the meaning most naturally suggested by the passage.<p>That he should not see death - That is, that he should not experience death, or be made personally acquainted with it. The word "taste" often occurs in the same sense. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>, "that he should taste death for every man;" compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-28.htm">Matthew 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-1.htm">Mark 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-27.htm">Luke 9:27</a>.<p>And was not found - <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>, "And he was not." That is, he was not in the land of the living. Paul retains the word used in the Septuagint.<p>He had this testimony, that he pleased God - Implied in the declaration in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-22.htm">Genesis 5:22</a>, that he "walked with God." This denotes a state of friendship between God and him, and of course implies that his conduct was pleasing to God. The apostle appeals here to the sense of the account in Genesis, but does not retain the very "words." The meaning here is not that the testimony respecting Enoch was actually "given" before his translation, but that the testimony relates to his having "pleased God" before he was removed. "Stuart." In regard to this instructive fragment of history, and to the reasons why Enoch was thus removed, we may make the following remarks:<p>(1) The age in which he lived was undoubtedly one of great wickedness. Enoch is selected as the only one of that generation signalized by eminent piety, and he appears to have spent his life in publicly reproving a sinful generation, and in warning them of the approaching judgment; Jde 1:14-15. The wickedness which ultimately led to the universal deluge seems already to have commenced in the earth, and Enoch, like Noah, his great-grandson, was raised up as a preacher of righteousness to reprove a sinful generation.<p>(2) it is not improbable that the great truths of religion in that age were extensively denied, and probably among other things the future state, the resurrection, the belief that man would exist in another world, and that it was maintained that death was the end of being - was an eternal sleep. If so, nothing could be better adapted to correct the prevailing evils than the removal of an eminent man, without dying, from the world. His departure would thus confirm the instructions of his life, and his removal, like the death of saints often now, would serve to make an impression which his living instructions would not.<p>(3) his removal is, in itself, a very important and instructive fact in history. It has occurred in no other instance except that of Elijah; nor has any other living man been transported to heaven except the Lord Jesus. That fact was instructive in a great many respects:<p>(a) It showed that there was a future state - another world.<p>(b) It showed that the "body" might exist in that future state - though doubtless so changed as to adapt it to the condition of things there.<p>(c) It prepared the world to credit the account of the ascension of the Redeemer. If Enoch and Elijah were removed thus without dying, there was no intrinsic improbability that the Lord Jesus would be removed after having died and risen again.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

By this he pleased God, and God testified to all the world he did so, by a miraculous translation of him from the world to himself. God cares not for, nor will take to him, such who please him not. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hebrews/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>By faith Enoch was translated,.... Which is to be understood, not of a spiritual translation from the power of darkness, into the kingdom of Christ, as all converted, persons are translated, and doubtless Enoch was; nor of a rapture, or removal from one part of the earth to another, or from one part of a country to another, as Philip was caught away by the Spirit, after the baptism of the eunuch; but of a translation from earth to heaven; and not for a while only, as Paul was caught up to the third heaven; but as Elijah was, there to continue, and as the living saints will be at the last day; and this was a translation of him, soul and body, to heaven, to eternal glory and happiness, by a change from mortality to immortality, which passed upon him; and which is a pledge of the resurrection of the dead, and a proof of the Old Testament saints knowing, expecting, and enjoying eternal life. And with this agrees the sense of some of the Jewish writers concerning this affair. Jonathan ben Uzziel, in his paraphrase on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a> has these words: <p>"and Enoch worshipped in truth before the Lord; and behold he was not with the inhabitants of the earth,  "he was translated", and ascended to the firmament (or heaven), by the Word before the Lord.'' <p>And the Jerusalem Targum to the same purpose; <p>"and Enoch worshipped in truth before the Lord; and lo, he was not, for he was translated by the Word from before the Lord;'' <p>or by the Word of the Lord, which went out from him; for this translation was of God, as our apostle afterwards asserts. R. Eleazar says (m): <p>"the holy blessed God took Enoch, and caused him to ascend to the highest heavens, and delivered into his hands all the superior treasures, &amp;c'' <p>He is said (n) to be one of the seven which entered into paradise in their life; and some of them say (o), that God took him, , body and soul; see the Apocrypha: <p>"He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living among sinners he was translated.'' (Wisdom 4:10) <p>"Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated, being an example of repentance to all generations.''

What lay at the root of Enoch’s translation? Faith, because before he was translated he was well-pleasing to God, which implies that he believed in God, or as Chrysostom neatly puts it: <span class="greekheb">πῶς δὲ πίστει μετετέθη ὁ Ἐνώχ</span>; <span class="greekheb">ὅτι τῆς μεταθέσεως ἡ εὐαρέστησις αἰτία</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῆς δὲ εὐαρεστήσεως ἡ πίστις</span>.

The use of the passive <span class="greekheb">μετετέθη</span> favours the supposition that result is here expressed, and throughout the sentence it is the translation that is prominent rather than the escape from death, which is introduced rather as an explanation of <span class="greekheb">μετετέθη</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο</span>.… These words are verbatim from the LXX of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm" title="And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.">Genesis 5:24</a>, and are quoted for the sake of bringing out clearly that God was the author of the translation. (<span class="ital">Cf.</span> the misquotation in Clem. <span class="ital">Ep.</span>, chap. 9, <span class="greekheb">οὐχ εὑρέθη αὐτοῦ θάνατος</span>.) God translated him, and this is proved by the fact that preceding the statement of his translation Scripture records that he pleased God well, where the Hebrew has “he walked with God”. <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς δὲ πίστεως ἀδύνατον εὐαρεστῆσαι</span>. “But without faith it is impossible to please Him well.” The ground of this proposition is given in the following words: <span class="greekheb">πιστεῦσαι γὰρ δεῖ τὸν προσερχόμενον</span>.… “For he who cometh to God must believe that He exists and that to those who seek Him He turns out to be a rewarder.” To please God one must draw near to Him (<span class="greekheb">τὸν προσερχόμενον</span> in the semi-technical sense usual in the Epistle), and no one can draw near who has not these two beliefs that God is and will reward those who seek Him.
