We should be pleased to think, how great the number of believers was under the Old Testament, and how strong their faith, though the objects of it were not then so fully made known as now. And we should lament that now, in gospel times, when the rule of faith is more clear and perfect, the number of believers should be so small, and their faith so weak. It is the excellence of the grace of faith, that, while it helps men to do great things, like Gideon, it keeps from high and great thoughts of themselves. Faith, like Barak's, has recourse unto God in all dangers and difficulties, and then makes grateful returns to God for all mercies and deliverances. By faith, the servants of God shall overcome even the roaring lion that goeth about seeking whom he may devour. The believer's faith endures to the end, and, in dying, gives him victory over death and all his deadly enemies, like Samson. The grace of God often fixes upon very undeserving and ill-deserving persons, to do great things for them and by them. But the grace of faith, wherever it is, will put men upon acknowledging God in all their ways, as Jephthah. It will make men bold and courageous in a good cause. Few ever met with greater trials, few ever showed more lively faith, than David, and he has left a testimony as to the trials and acts of faith, in the book of Psalms, which has been, and ever will be, of great value to the people of God. Those are likely to grow up to be distinguished for faith, who begin betimes, like Samuel, to exercise it. And faith will enable a man to serve God and his generation, in whatever way he may be employed. The interests and powers of kings and kingdoms, are often opposed to God and his people; but God can easily subdue all that set themselves against him. It is a greater honour and happiness to work righteousness than to work miracles. By faith we have comfort of the promises; and by faith we are prepared to wait for the promises, and in due time to receive them. And though we do not hope to have our dead relatives or friends restored to life in this world, yet faith will support under the loss of them, and direct to the hope of a better resurrection. Shall we be most amazed at the wickedness of human nature, that it is capable of such awful cruelties to fellow-creatures, or at the excellence of Divine grace, that is able to bear up the faithful under such cruelties, and to carry them safely through all? What a difference between God's judgement of a saint, and man's judgment! The world is not worthy of those scorned, persecuted saints, whom their persecutors reckon unworthy to live. They are not worthy of their company, example, counsel, or other benefits. For they know not what a saint is, nor the worth of a saint, nor how to use him; they hate, and drive such away, as they do the offer of Christ and his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Women received their dead raised to life again - As in the case of the woman of Zarephath, whose child was restored to life by Elijah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19-24</a>; and of the son of the Shunamite woman whose child was restored to life by Elisha; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-18.htm">2 Kings 4:18-37</a>.<p>And others were tortured - The word which is used here - &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  tumpanizo&#772; - to "tympanize," refers to a form of severe torture which was sometimes practiced. It is derived from &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  tumpanon - "tympanum" - a drum, tabret, timbrel; and the instrument was probably so called from resembling the drum or the timbrel. This instrument consisted in the East of a thin wooden rim covered over with skin, as a tambourine is with us; see it described in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>. The engine of torture here referred to, probably resembled the drum in form, on which the body of a criminal was bent so as to give greater severity to the wounds which were inflicted by scourging. The lash would cut deeper when the body was so extended, and the open gashes exposed to the air would increase the torture; see 2 Macc. 6:19-29. The punishment here referred to seems to have consisted of two things - the stretching upon the instrument, and the scourging; see Robinson's Lexicon and Stuart in loc. Bloomfield, however, supposes that the mode of the torture can be best learned from the original meaning of the word &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  tumpanon - "tympanum" - as meaning:<p>(1) a beatingstick, and,<p>(2) a beating-post which was in the form of a T, thus suggesting the posture of the sufferer. This beating, says he, was sometimes administered with sticks or rods; and sometimes with leather thongs inclosing pieces of lead. The former account, however, better agrees with the usual meaning of the word.<p>Not accepting deliverance - When it was offered them; that is, on condition that they would renounce their opinions, or do what was required of them. This is the very nature of the spirit of martyrdom.<p>That they might obtain a better resurrection - That is, when they were subjected to this kind of torture they were looked upon as certainly dead. To have accepted deliverance then, would have been a kind of restoration to life, or a species of resurrection. But they refused this, and looked forward to a more honorable and glorious restoration to life; a resurrection, therefore, which would be better than this. It would be in itself more noble and honorable, and would be permanent, and therefore better. No particular instance of this kind is mentioned in the Old Testament; but amidst the multitude of cases of persecution to which good men were subjected, there is no improbability in supposing that this may have occurred. The case of Eleazer, recorded in 2 Macc. 6, so strongly resembles what the apostle says here, that it is very possible he may have had it in his eye. The passage before us proves that the doctrine of the resurrection was understood and believed before the coming of the Saviour, and that it was one of the doctrines which sustained and animated those who were called to suffer on account of their religion. In the prospect of death under the infliction of torture on account of religion, or under the pain produced by disease, nothing will better enable us to bear up under the suffering than the expectation that the body will be restored to immortal vigour, and raised to a mode of life where it will be no longer susceptible of pain. To be raised up to that life is a "better resurrection" than to be saved from death when persecuted, or to be raised up from a bed of pain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. Women received their dead raised&#8212;as the widow of Zarephath (1Ki 17:17-24). The Shunammite (2Ki 4:17-35). The two oldest manuscripts read. "They received women of aliens by raising their dead." 1Ki 17:24 shows that the raising of the widow's son by Elijah led her to the faith, so that he thus took her into fellowship, an alien though she was. Christ, in Lu 4:26, makes especial mention of the fact that Elijah was sent to an alien from Israel, a woman of Sarepta. Thus Paul may quote this as an instance of Elijah's faith, that at God's command he went to a Gentile city of Sidonia (contrary to Jewish prejudices), and there, as the fruit of faith, not only raised her dead son, but received her as a convert into the family of God, as Vulgate reads. Still, English Version may be the right reading.<p>and&#8212;Greek, "but"; in contrast to those raised again to life.<p>tortured&#8212;"broken on the wheel."

So the seven brothers, 2 Maccabees 7:9, 11, 14, 29, 36; and Eleazar, 2 Maccabees 6:21, 28, 30, "Though I might have been delivered from death, I endure these severe pains, being beaten."<p>a better resurrection&#8212;than that of the women's children "raised to life again"; or, than the resurrection which their foes could give them by delivering them from death (Da 12:2; Lu 20:35; Php 3:11). The fourth of the brethren (referring to Da 12:2) said to King Antiochus, "To be put to death by men, is to be chosen to look onward for the hopes which are of God, to be raised up again by Him; but for thee there is no resurrection to life." The writer of Second Maccabees expressly disclaims inspiration, which prevents our mistaking Paul's allusion here to it as if it sanctioned the Apocrypha as inspired. In quoting Daniel, he quotes a book claiming inspiration, and so tacitly sanctions that claim.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Women received their dead raised to life again:</span> through this Divine faith, both the prophets Elijah and Elisha did raise and restore, the one to the window of Sarepta, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-22.htm" title="And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.">1 Kings 17:22</a>,23</span>, the other to the Shunammite, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-35.htm" title="Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.">2 Kings 4:35</a>,36</span>, their sons from the dead; and these women and mothers did by faith receive them from the prophets alive again, who by faith and prayer procured this mercy from the quickening Lord, for them.

(2 Maccabees 7) <p>that they might obtain a better resurrection; which they died in the faith of, see the Apocryha: <p>"7 And him he sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom he made high priest, and commanded that he should take vengeance of the children of Israel. 11 And said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for his laws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again. 14 So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life. (2 Maccabees) <p>The resurrection of the saints, which is unto everlasting life, is a better resurrection than mere metaphorical, and figurative ones, as deliverances from great afflictions, which are called deaths; or real ones, which were only to a mortal state, and in order to die again, as those under the Old Testament, and under the New, before the resurrection of Christ; or than the resurrection of the wicked: for the resurrection the saints will obtain will be first, at the beginning of the thousand years; the wicked will not live till after they are ended; it will be by virtue of union to Christ, whereas the wicked will be raised merely by virtue of his power; the saints will rise with bodies glorious, powerful, and spiritual, the wicked with base, vile, and ignoble ones; the righteous will come forth to the resurrection of life, the wicked to the resurrection of damnation. The consideration of the better resurrection is of great use to strengthen faith, under sufferings, for righteousness sake, and this is obtained by suffering; not that suffering is the meritorious cause of it, but saints in this way come to it; it is promised to such, and it will be attained unto, and enjoyed by such; for all that live godly, do, and must suffer persecution in one way or another. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{t}</span> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</span><p>(t) He seems to mean the story of that woman of Sarepta, whose son Elijah raised again from the dead, and the Shunammite, whose son Elisha restored to his mother.<p>(u) He means that perfection which Antiochus wrought.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-35.htm" title="Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:">Hebrews 11:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔλαβον γυναῖκες ἐξ ἀναστάσεως τοὺς νεκροὺς αὐτῶν</span>] <span class="ital">Women received back their dead</span> (their sons) <span class="ital">through resurrection</span>.

See Suicer’s Thesaurus, which also proves the fact from Gataker, that this word is frequently used to express any violent death. I fancy the reason is, because clubs are a kind of arms most generally met with in all tumults and in a concourse of people: at least in this very passage the apostle seems to point to all kinds of death caused by tumults and inflicted by clubs (in which is included the mode adopted by Antiochus [the tympanum], and mentioned as surpassing the other instruments of torture), and in the following verse he comes to more exquisite punishments [punishments more refined in cruelty].

The latter part is as evidently suggested at least by the narrative of 2 Macc. 7; where it is recorded how, under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, seven sons of one mother were tortured and put to death; how one of them, in the midst of his tortures, having deliverance and advancement offered him if he would forsake the Law of his fathers, courageously refused the offer; and how both they and their mother, who encouraged them to persevere, reiterated their hope of a resurrection from the dead. The "better resurrection" means the resurrection to eternal life by them looked for, which was "better" than the temporary restoration to life in this world granted to the sons of the widow of Zarephath and the Shunammite; while the article in the Greek before "deliverance" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) may be due to the thought of that which is recorded to have been offered to those in the writer's immediate view. There is some doubt as to the exact import of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "tortured"). The usual meaning of the Greek word is" to beat," as a drum is beaten, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a drum or drumstick: and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to beat to death." But, inasmuch as the instrument of torture to which Eleazar (whose martyrdom is related in the preceding chapter of 2 Maccabees) was brought is called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (6:19, 28), it has been supposed that the punishment referred to was the stretching of the victims, in the way of a rack, on a sort of wheel called a <span class="accented">tympanum</span>, on which they were then beaten to death, as Eleazar was. So Vulgate, <span class="accented">distenti sunt.</span> The fact that the seven of 2 Macc. 7. were not so martyred, but by fire and other tortures, is not inconsistent with this view; for our author need not be supposed to confine his view to them, but uses the word suggested by Eleazar's case. Whatever be the exact import of the word, the A.V.

The A.V. of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-13.htm">1 Samuel 21:13</a>, describing the feigned madness of David, renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; "he scrabbled on the doors of the gate," meaning that he beat the doors like a madman. &#x3a4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; means a drum or a drumstick; hence a cudgel; so Aristoph. Plut. 476, where it is associated with &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; a pillory. Comp. 2 Macc. 6:19, 28. The meaning here is, were beaten to death with clubs, the word being used to represent cruel torture in general.<p>Not accepting deliverance (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>For the verb, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-34.htm">Hebrews 10:34</a>. The (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;) deliverance offered at the price of denying their faith. See 2 Macc. 6:21-27.<p>A better resurrection (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Better than a resurrection like those granted to the women above mentioned, which gave merely a continuation of life on earth. Comp. 2 Macc. 7:9, 14. </body></html>
