We should be pleased to think, how great the number of believers was under the Old Testament, and how strong their faith, though the objects of it were not then so fully made known as now. And we should lament that now, in gospel times, when the rule of faith is more clear and perfect, the number of believers should be so small, and their faith so weak. It is the excellence of the grace of faith, that, while it helps men to do great things, like Gideon, it keeps from high and great thoughts of themselves. Faith, like Barak's, has recourse unto God in all dangers and difficulties, and then makes grateful returns to God for all mercies and deliverances. By faith, the servants of God shall overcome even the roaring lion that goeth about seeking whom he may devour. The believer's faith endures to the end, and, in dying, gives him victory over death and all his deadly enemies, like Samson. The grace of God often fixes upon very undeserving and ill-deserving persons, to do great things for them and by them. But the grace of faith, wherever it is, will put men upon acknowledging God in all their ways, as Jephthah. It will make men bold and courageous in a good cause. Few ever met with greater trials, few ever showed more lively faith, than David, and he has left a testimony as to the trials and acts of faith, in the book of Psalms, which has been, and ever will be, of great value to the people of God. Those are likely to grow up to be distinguished for faith, who begin betimes, like Samuel, to exercise it. And faith will enable a man to serve God and his generation, in whatever way he may be employed. The interests and powers of kings and kingdoms, are often opposed to God and his people; but God can easily subdue all that set themselves against him. It is a greater honour and happiness to work righteousness than to work miracles. By faith we have comfort of the promises; and by faith we are prepared to wait for the promises, and in due time to receive them. And though we do not hope to have our dead relatives or friends restored to life in this world, yet faith will support under the loss of them, and direct to the hope of a better resurrection. Shall we be most amazed at the wickedness of human nature, that it is capable of such awful cruelties to fellow-creatures, or at the excellence of Divine grace, that is able to bear up the faithful under such cruelties, and to carry them safely through all? What a difference between God's judgement of a saint, and man's judgment! The world is not worthy of those scorned, persecuted saints, whom their persecutors reckon unworthy to live. They are not worthy of their company, example, counsel, or other benefits. For they know not what a saint is, nor the worth of a saint, nor how to use him; they hate, and drive such away, as they do the offer of Christ and his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And others had trial of cruel mockings - Referring to the scorn and derision which the ancient victims of persecution experienced.

We must therefore suppose that the author designed further to refer to those, as forming a special category, who, without suffering actual death, were exposed to other kinds of tortures and miseries; that he still derived, however, the main colours for this new picture from the historic figure which but just now had been present to his mind in connection with the <span class="greekheb">ἐτυμπανίσθησαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The enhancing <span class="greekheb">ἔτι δέ</span> is to be explained from the fact that <span class="greekheb">ἐμπαιγμοὶ καὶ μάστιγες</span> denotes the <span class="ital">more transient</span> suffering, in point of time more brief; <span class="greekheb">δεσμοὶ καὶ φυλακή</span>, on the other hand, the <span class="ital">longer enduring</span> sufferings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πεῖραν λαμβάνειν</span>] here in the passive sense: <span class="ital">to have experience of something</span>.

There was also a tradition that Jeremiah was stoned at Daphne in Egypt. <span class="greekheb">ἐπρίσθησαν</span>, “they were sawn asunder,” a cruel death sometimes inflicted on prisoners of war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm" title="And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon.

(<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm" title="You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Hebrews 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-1.htm" title="For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:">Hebrews 5:1</a>) was sawn asunder by Manasseh with a wooden saw. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Justin, <span class="ital">Trypho</span>, 120, (<span class="greekheb">πρίονι ξυλίνῳ ἐπρίσατε</span>) and Charles’ <span class="ital">Ascension of Isaiah</span>. Within our own memory some of the followers of the Bâb suffered the same death. <span class="greekheb">ἐπειράσθησαν</span>, “were tempted”. Alford says, “I do not see how any appropriate meaning can be given to the mere enduring of temptation, placed as it is between being sawn asunder and dying by the sword”. He would therefore either omit the word as a gloss on <span class="greekheb">ἐπρίσθησαν</span> or substitute <span class="greekheb">ἐπρήσθησαν</span>. That is a tempting reading because not only was one of the seven brothers (2 Maccabees 6; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-5.htm" title="Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commanded him being yet alive to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good space dispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to die manfully, saying thus,">2Ma 7:5</a>) fried, but those who sought to keep the Sabbath in a cave (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-11.htm" title="And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day.">2Ma 6:11</a>) were all burned together by order of Philip, Antiochus’ governor in Jerusalem. At the same time, the reading, “were tempted” gives quite a good sense, for certainly the most fiendish element in the torture of the seven brothers was the pressure put on each individually to recant. <span class="greekheb">ἐν φόνῳ μαχαίρης ἀπέθανον</span>, “died by sword-slaughter,” for <span class="greekheb">ἐν φ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μαχ</span>. see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-13.htm" title="And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.">Exodus 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-24.htm" title="And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.">Numbers 21:24</a>, etc.; and for <span class="greekheb">ἀπεθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-22.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:">Jeremiah 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm" title="He that stays in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.">Jeremiah 21:9</a>.

The mention of "mockings" is prominent in the Maccabean history; "bonds and imprisonments" recall Hanani, Micaiah, and Jeremiah; "they were stoned" recalls Zachariah son of Jehoiada (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>). "They wandered in sheepskins (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) and in deserts" peculiarly suggests Elijah (his mantle being called <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13, 14</a>), though the Maccabean heroes also took refuge in "deserts and mountains" (1 Macc. 2.). "Sawn asunder" (denoting a mode of executing martyrs of which there is no instance in the Old Testament or Apocrypha) most probably refers to a well-known tradition about Isaiah, who is said to have so suffered under Manasseh. Alford thus gives the notices found elsewhere of this tradition: "Justin Martyr 'Trypho,' &sect; 120; Tertullian, 'Cont. Guest. Scorpiac.,' 8, and 'De Patient.,' 14; Origen, Ep. ad African.;' Lactantius, 'Inst.,' 4:11; Ps-Epiphanius, 'Vit. Proph.; Augustine, 'De Civ. Dei,' 18:24; Jerome, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>." Jerome calls it a "certissima traditio apud Judaeos," and says that this passage in the Epistle was by most referred to the passion of Isaiah. The tameness and apparent inappropriateness of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> ("were tempted") in ver. 36, in the midst of an enumeration of cruel modes of death, has led to a prevalent view that it is a corruption of the original text. Various conjectures have been made, the most tenable being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it is an interpolation, arising kern the repetition by some copyist of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, which was afterwards altered to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it is a substitution for some other word through error in transcription, the most likely conjecture as to the word originally written being <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "were burnt." Either form, especially the latter, might easily be changed to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: and thus death by fire would have been originally included in the enumeration, which was likely to have been the case, especially since it is mentioned prominently in the account of the martyrdom of the seven sons. But, as there is no authority of any manuscript for a different word, this is mere conjecture; though the omission of the word altogether in some few manuscripts and versions, and variations of reading in others, suggest some uncertainty as to the original text. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> if genuine, may possibly have been suggested by alliteration, and by thought of the temptations to apostatize prominent in the account both of Eleazar and of the seven sons. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of cruel mockings (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>N.T.o , oClass.
