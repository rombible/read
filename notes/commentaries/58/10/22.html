As believers had an open way to the presence of God, it became them to use this privilege. The way and means by which Christians enjoy such privileges, is by the blood of Jesus, by the merit of that blood which he offered up as an atoning sacrifice. The agreement of infinite holiness with pardoning mercy, was not clearly understood till the human nature of Christ, the Son of God, was wounded and bruised for our sins. Our way to heaven is by a crucified Saviour; his death is to us the way of life, and to those who believe this, he will be precious. They must draw near to God; it would be contempt of Christ, still to keep at a distance. Their bodies were to be washed with pure water, alluding to the cleansings directed under the law: thus the use of water in baptism, was to remind Christians that their conduct should be pure and holy. While they derived comfort and grace from their reconciled Father to their own souls, they would adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Believers are to consider how they can be of service to each other, especially stirring up each other to the more vigorous and abundant exercise of love, and the practice of good works. The communion of saints is a great help and privilege, and a means of stedfastness and perseverance. We should observe the coming of times of trial, and be thereby quickened to greater diligence. There is a trying day coming on all men, the day of our death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let us draw near with a true heart - In prayer and praise; in every act of confidence and of worship. A sincere heart was required under the ancient dispensation; it is always demanded of people when they draw near to God to worship him; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>. Every form of religion which God has revealed requires the worshippers to come with pure and holy hearts.<p>In full assurance of faith - see the word used here explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11</a>. The "full assurance of faith" means unwavering confidence; a fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt. Christians are permitted to come thus because God has revealed himself through the Redeemer as in every way deserving their fullest confidence. No one approaches God in an acceptable manner who does not come to him in this manner. What parent would feel that a child came with any right feelings to ask a favour of him who had not "the fullest confidence in him?"<p>("This &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  ple&#772;rophoria, or full assurance of faith, is not, as many imagine, absolute certainty of a man's own particular salvation, for that is termed "the full assurance of hope," <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11</a>, and arises from faith and its fruits. But the full assurance of faith is the assurance of that truth, which is testified and proposed in the gospel, to all the hearers of it in common, to be believed by them, unto their salvation, and is also termed the full assurance of understanding; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>. Though all that the gospel reveals, claims the full assurance of faith, yet here it seems more particularly to respect the efficacy and all-sufficiency of Christ's offering for procuring pardon and acceptance." - McLean.<p>Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience - By the blood of Jesus. This was prepared to make the conscience pure. The Jewish cleansing or sprinkling with blood related only to what was external, and could not make the conscience perfect <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>, but the sacrifice offered by the Saviour was designed to give peace to the troubled mind, and to make it pure and holy. An "evil conscience" is a consciousness of evil, or a conscience oppressed with sin; that is, a conscience that accuses of guilt. We are made free from such a conscience through the atonement of Jesus, not because we become convinced that we have not committed sin, and not because we are led to suppose that our sins are less than we had otherwise supposed - for the reverse of both these is true - but because our sins are forgiven, and since they are freely pardoned they no longer produce remorse and the fear of future wrath. A child that has been forgiven may feel that he has done very wrong, but still he will not be then overpowered with distress in view of his guilt, or with the apprehension of punishment.<p>And our bodies washed with pure water - It was common for the Jews to wash themselves, or to perform various ablutions in their services; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-4.htm">Exodus 39:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-27.htm">Leviticus 6:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-54.htm">Leviticus 13:54</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-58.htm">Leviticus 13:58</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-16.htm">Leviticus 15:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-24.htm">Leviticus 16:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-6.htm">Leviticus 22:6</a>; compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3</a>. The same thing was also true among the pagan. There was usually, at the entrance of their temples, a vessel placed with consecrated water, in which, as Pliny says (Hist. Nat. lib. 15:c. 30), there was a branch of laurel placed with which the priests sprinkled all who approached for worship. It was necessary that this water should be pure, and it was drawn fresh from wells or fountains for the purpose. Water from pools and ponds was regarded as unsuitable, as was also even the purest water of the fountain, if it had stood long. AEneas sprinkled himself in this manner, as he was about to enter the invisible world (Aeneid vi. 635), with fresh water.<p>Porphyry says that the Essenes were accustomed to cleanse themselves with the purest water. Thus, Ezekiel also says, "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean." Sea-water was usually regarded as best adapted to this purpose, as the salt was supposed to have a cleansing property. The Jews who dwelt near the sea, were thence accustomed, as Aristides says, to wash their hands every morning on this account in the sea-water. Potter's Greek Archae. i. 222. Rosenmuller, Alte und Neue Morgenland, in loc. It was from the pagan custom of placing a vessel with consecrated water at the entrance of their temples, that the Roman Catholic custom is derived in their churches of placing "holy water" near the door, that those who worship there may "cross themselves." In accordance with the Jewish custom, the apostle says, that it was proper that under the Christian dispensation we should approach God, having performed an act emblematic of purity by the application of water to the body.<p>That there is an allusion to baptism is clear. The apostle is comparing the two dispensations, and his aim is to show that in the Christian dispensation there was everything which was regarded as valuable and important in the old. So he had shown it to have been in regard to the fact that there was a Lawgiver; that there was a great High Priest; and that there were sacrifices and ordinances of religion in the Christian dispensation as well as the Jewish. In regard to each of these, he had shown that they existed in the Christian religion in a much more valuable and important sense than under the ancient dispensation. In like manner it was true, that as they were required to come to the service of God, having performed various ablutions to keep the body pure, so it was with Christians. Water was applied to the Jews as emblematic of purity, and Christians came, having had it applied to them also in baptism, as a symbol of holiness.<p>It is not necessary, in order to see the force of this, to suppose that water had been applied to the whole of the body, or that they had been completely immersed, for all the force of the reasoning is retained by the supposition that it was a mere symbol or emblem of purification. The whole stress of the argument here turns, not on the fact that the body had been washed all over, but that the worshipper had been qualified for the spiritual service of the Most High in connection with an appropriate emblematic ceremony. The quantity of water used for this is not a material point, any more than the quantity of oil was in the ceremony of inaugurating kings and priests. This was not done in the Christian dispensation by washing the body frequently, as in the ancient system, nor even necessarily by washing the whole body - which would no more contribute to the purity of the heart than by application of water to any part of the body, but by the fact that water had been used as emblematic of the purifying of the soul. The passage before us proves, undoubtedly:<p>(1) that water should be applied under the new dispensation as an ordinance of religion; and,<p>(2) that pure water should be used - for that only is a proper emblem of the purity of the heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

As "faith" occurs here, so "hope," and "love," Heb 10:23, 24.<p>sprinkled from&#8212;that is, sprinkled so as to be cleansed from.<p>evil conscience&#8212;a consciousness of guilt unatoned for, and uncleansed away (Heb 10:2; Heb 9:9). Both the hearts and the bodies are cleansed. The legal purifications were with blood of animal victims and with water, and could only cleanse the flesh (Heb 9:13, 21). Christ's blood purifies the heart and conscience. The Aaronic priest, in entering the holy place, washed with water (Heb 9:19) in the brazen laver. Believers, as priests to God, are once for all washed in BODY (as distinguished from "hearts") at baptism. As we have an immaterial, and a material nature, the cleansing of both is expressed by "hearts" and "body," the inner and the outer man; so the whole man, material and immaterial. The baptism of the body, however, is not the mere putting away of material filth, nor an act operating by intrinsic efficacy, but the sacramental seal, applied to the outer man, of a spiritual washing (1Pe 3:21). "Body" (not merely "flesh," the carnal part, as 2Co 7:1) includes the whole material man, which needs cleansing, as being redeemed, as well as the soul. The body, once polluted with sin, is washed, so as to be fitted like Christ's holy body, and by His body, to be spiritually a pure and living offering. On the "pure water," the symbol of consecration and sanctification, compare Joh 19:34; 1Co 6:11; 1Jo 5:6; Eze 36:25. The perfects "having &#8230; hearts sprinkled &#8230; body (the Greek is singular) washed," imply a continuing state produced by a once-for-all accomplished act, namely, our justification by faith through Christ's blood, and consecration to God, sealed sacramentally by the baptism of our body.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let us draw near;

Either to the holiest of all, into which the saints have boldness to enter; or to Christ the high priest, who is entered there; or to the house of God, over which he is an high priest; or rather to God himself, as on a throne of grace, on the mercy seat in heaven, the most holy place: to "draw near" to him is a sacerdotal act, common to all the saints, who are made priests to God; and includes the whole of divine worship, but more especially designs prayer; to which believers are encouraged from the liberty and boldness they may have and use, of entering into the holiest by the blood of Jesus; from Christ's being the new and living way into it, and from his being an high priest over the house of God: the manner of drawing near is, "with a true heart"; not with the body only, but with the heart principally; with a renewed one, one that is right with God, and is single and sincere, is hearty in its desires, and upright in its ends. <p>In full assurance of faith; in God, Father, Son, and Spirit; without faith, drawing near to God can neither be acceptable to him, nor of service to men; and a full assurance of faith, with respect to the object drawn nigh unto, and of the way unto him, and of acceptance with him through Christ, and of having the petitions put up to him granted, is very comfortable to believers, greatly becomes them, and is well pleasing to God: <p>having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience; which is blind, inactive, partial, stupid, or guilty; and it is the blood of Christ, which being sprinkled on it by the Spirit of God, purges it from dead works, cleanses it from all sin, and speaks peace and pardon to it; and such may draw near with freedom and boldness, with readiness and cheerfulness, and with reverence and godly fear: <p>and our bodies washed with pure water; not baptismal water, but the grace of the Spirit, which is often compared to water, in Scripture: the body, as well as soul, needs washing, and renewing; internal grace influences outward, actions, which adorn religion, and without which bodies cannot be presented holy to God. The allusion is to a custom of the Jews, who were obliged to wash their bodies, and make them clean, when they prayed. So Aben Ezra observes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a><p>"that every Israelite, when he went to pray at a fixed place, was obliged to have , "his body pure", and his garments pure.'' <p>So a priest might not enter into the court for service, though clean, until he had washed himself all over (z); and it is to sacerdotal acts that the reference is here. <p>(z) Misn.

Chrysostom has <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ὑποκρίσεως</span>. Davidson has “with fundamental genuineness”; but it is the genuineness which is elicited in presence of realities. <span class="greekheb">καρδία</span> is interpreted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm" title="But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.">1 Peter 3:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ κρυπτὸς τῆς καρδίας ἄνθρωπος</span>.

To engender this full assurance has been the aim of the writer throughout the Epistle. <span class="greekheb">ῥεραντισμένοι</span> … <span class="greekheb">λελουσμένοι</span>. These participles express not conditions of approach to God which are yet to be achieved, but conditions already possessed, “our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our body washed with pure water”. Both participles must be construed with <span class="greekheb">προσερχώμεθα</span>. The obvious connection of “heart” and “body” forbids the attachment of <span class="greekheb">λελουσμένοι</span> to <span class="greekheb">κατέχωμεν</span>. To connect both participles with <span class="greekheb">κατεχ</span>. is equally impossible. “<span class="greekheb">προσέρχεσθαι</span> is a technical liturgical word, and sprinkling and washing are liturgical acts of preparation” (Delitzsch). Possibly the mention of sprinkling and washing is an echo of the injunctions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-4.htm" title="And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-21.htm" title="And you shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Exodus 29:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-20.htm" title="When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire to the LORD:">Exodus 30:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-30.htm" title="And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash with.">Exodus 40:30</a>, prescribing similar preparation for the priestly functions.

We may now draw near to the very heavenly mercy-seat, without any sense of a bar to our doing so on the ground of consciousness of sin. In Christ we are to see accomplished all that is needed for atonement. But there are conditions also required in ourselves, expressed first by the "true heart," and the "fullness of faith," and then by the clauses that fellow. These clauses, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> have a liturgical basis - that of the blood-sprinkling (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> of the people with the blood of the covenant under Mount Sinai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>, and of the priests on their consecration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-23.htm">Leviticus 8:23</a>) and of the ablutions before sacrificial service (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30</a>:39). Hence these two participial clauses are not to be separated from each other, and seem best to be both taken in connection with the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>. "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" means our having the inward consciousness of debarring sin removed through the blood of Christ; the "full assurance of faith" in the completed atonement, and the "true heart," being presupposed. The conjoined clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., is capable also of being figuratively interpreted, in the sense that "our sinful bodies" have been "made clean," so as to be offered through life acceptably as "a living sacrifice," as well as "our souls washed through his most precious blood." And this may be taken as implied. But the terms <span class="accented">body</span> and <span class="accented">water</span> after <span class="accented">hearts</span> and <span class="accented">blood</span> certainly suggest a direct reference to baptism. And such definite allusion is in keeping with references elsewhere to the beginning of the Christian life (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). The passage last referred to is apposite to that before us in that with an undoubted mention of baptism is conjoined "the answer of a good <span class="accented">conscience</span> toward God." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/hebrews/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Let us draw near (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>.<p>With a true heart (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>A right and genuine inward attitude toward God. For the phrase comp. lxx, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a>. N.T.o. For &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm">Hebrews 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>. A true heart is required to enter the true sanctuary. The phrase means more than in sincerity. Sincerity is included, but with it all that enters into a right attitude toward God as revealed in our Great High Priest, - gladness, freedom, enthusiasm, bold appropriation of all the privileges of sonship.<p>In full assurance of faith (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Full conviction engendered by faith.

As the priests were sprinkled with the sacrificial blood and washed with water before ministering, so do you who have now the privilege and standing of priests in approaching God, draw near, priestlike, as sharers in an economy which purges the conscience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>), having your consciences purged. Your own hearts must experience the effects of the great sacrifice of Christ, - pardon, moral renewal, deliverance from a legal spirit. On the priesthood of believers see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>. This idea is dominated in our epistle by that of Christ's priesthood; but it is not excluded, and is implied throughout. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>. For sprinkled, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>.<p>Bodies washed (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)<p>Also typological. Most, expositors refer to baptism. The most significant passage in that direction is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>. It may be, though I doubt if the idea is emphasized. I incline, with Dr. Bruce, to think that it indicates generally the thoroughness of the cleansing process undergone by one who surrenders himself, soul, body, and spirit, to God. </body></html>
