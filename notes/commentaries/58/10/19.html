For though there are some occasional intermixtures of doctrines, consonant to those before insisted on, yet his professed design henceforward is to propose to, and press on, the believing Hebrews, such duties as the truths he had insisted on laid a foundation for, and showed to be necessary to be practised. <span class="ital">Having therefore boldness </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">παρρησια</span>, thus rendered, properly means <span class="ital">liberty of speech; </span>and by an easy figure, <span class="ital">boldness, </span>or <span class="ital">confidence, </span>as it is rendered chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>. Here it signifies that boldness which arises from a firm persuasion of our title to appear before God as pardoned persons, through the blood of Christ. <span class="ital">To enter into the holiest </span>— That is, the true sanctuary, the holy place not made with hands, the immediate gracious presence of God himself in Christ Jesus. Whatever was typically represented in the most holy place of old, we have access to, especially into the favour and friendship of God, and a state of fellowship with him. Of this privilege the blood of Christ, or his sacrifice, is the procuring cause. By this, all causes of distance between God and believers are removed. For on the one hand, it made atonement for our sins, and procured our free justification; and on the other gives peace to our consciences, and removes every discouraging fear of approaching him, whether in his ordinances here, or in his kingdom and glory hereafter. <span class="ital">By a new and living way — </span>He calls it a new way, because it was but newly made and prepared; belongs to the new covenant, and admits of no decays, but is always new, as to its efficacy and use, as in the day of its first preparation; whereas that of the tabernacle waxed old, and so was prepared for a removal. And he terms it <span class="ital">a living way, </span>because all that use it are alive to God, and in the way to life everlasting. And this is no other than the way of faith, or confidence in the mercy and promises of God, through the sacrifice of Christ, according to the revelation made thereof in the gospel; <span class="ital">which he hath consecrated </span>— Prepared, dedicated, and established; <span class="ital">through the veil, that is, his flesh </span>— He refers to the veil that was interposed between the holy and the most holy place of the Jewish tabernacle and temple: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-3.htm" title="And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;">Hebrews 9:3</a>. This veil, on our Lord’s death, was rent from the top to the bottom, by which the most holy place became visible and accessible to all that were in the outward tabernacle; by which fact was signified, that by virtue of Christ’s sacrifice, whereby his flesh was torn and rent, the God of heaven was manifested, and the way to heaven laid open to all true believers. <span class="ital">And having a High-Priest over the house — </span>Or family; <span class="ital">of God </span>— Who continually appears in the presence of God, and ever lives to make intercession for us; <span class="ital">let us draw near </span>— To God; <span class="ital">with a true heart </span>— In godly sincerity, and with fervent desire after such blessings of the gospel as we have not yet received; <span class="ital">in full assurance of faith </span>— That we shall find acceptance with God through the mediation of our High-Priest, and the answer of our petitions; <span class="ital">having our hearts sprinkled </span>— That is, cleansed, by the application of Christ’s blood; <span class="ital">from an evil conscience </span>— Namely, a conscience defiled with the guilt of past sin. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>. When the Israelites were ceremonially polluted, they were to be cleansed by sprinkling them with the water of separation, described <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/19-2.htm" title="This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and on which never came yoke:...">Numbers 19:2-10</a>; but the sprinkling or cleansing here recommended is not of the body from ceremonial pollution, but of the soul from the guilt and distress of an accusing conscience. This cleansing is effected neither by water nor by the blood of beasts, but by faith in Christ’s blood, shed as a sin-offering, whereby the repenting sinner hath a full assurance of pardon. <span class="ital">And our bodies washed with pure water — </span>All our conversation unblameable and holy, through the influence of God’s sanctifying Spirit. This seems to be spoken with an allusion to the high-priest’s washing his body with water before he entered the inward tabernacle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm" title="He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen turban shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.">Leviticus 16:4</a>. In that manner also the Levites were purified, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-7.htm" title="And thus shall you do to them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying on them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.">Numbers 8:7</a>,) to prepare them for the service of the sanctuary.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:19-25 The apostle having closed the first part of the epistle, the doctrine is applied to practical purposes. As believers had an open way to the presence of God, it became them to use this privilege. The way and means by which Christians enjoy such privileges, is by the blood of Jesus, by the merit of that blood which he offered up as an atoning sacrifice. The agreement of infinite holiness with pardoning mercy, was not clearly understood till the human nature of Christ, the Son of God, was wounded and bruised for our sins. Our way to heaven is by a crucified Saviour; his death is to us the way of life, and to those who believe this, he will be precious. They must draw near to God; it would be contempt of Christ, still to keep at a distance. Their bodies were to be washed with pure water, alluding to the cleansings directed under the law: thus the use of water in baptism, was to remind Christians that their conduct should be pure and holy. While they derived comfort and grace from their reconciled Father to their own souls, they would adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Believers are to consider how they can be of service to each other, especially stirring up each other to the more vigorous and abundant exercise of love, and the practice of good works. The communion of saints is a great help and privilege, and a means of stedfastness and perseverance. We should observe the coming of times of trial, and be thereby quickened to greater diligence. There is a trying day coming on all men, the day of our death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having therefore, brethren - The apostle, in this verse, enters on the hortatory part of his Epistle, which continues to the end of it. He had gone into an extensive examination of the Jewish and Christian systems; he had compared the Founders of the two - Moses and the Son of God, and shown how far superior the latter was to the former; he had compared the Christian Great High Priest with the Jewish high priest, and shown his superiority; he had compared the sacrifices under the two dispensations, and showed that in all respects the Christian sacrifice was superior to the Jewish - that it was an offering that cleansed from sin; that it was sufficient when once offered without being repeated, while the Jewish offerings were only typical, and were unable to put away sin; and he had shown that the great High Priest of the Christian profession had opened a way to the mercy-seat in heaven, and was himself now seated there; and having shown this, he now exhorts Christians to avail themselves fully of all their advantages, and to enjoy to the widest extent all the privileges now conferred on them. One of the first of these benefits was, that they had now free access to the mercy-seat.<p>Boldness to enter into the holiest - Margin, "liberty." The word rendered "boldness" - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  parre&#772;sian - properly means "boldness of speech," or freedom where one speaks all that he thinks (notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>); and then it means boldness in general, license, authority, pardon. Here the idea is, that before Christ died and entered into heaven, there was no such access to the throne of grace as man needed. Man had no offering which he could bring that would make him acceptable to God. But now the way was open. Access was free for all, and all might come with the utmost freedom. The word "holiest" here is taken from the holy of holies in the temple (notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-3.htm">Hebrews 9:3</a>), and is there applied to heaven, of which that was the emblem. The entrance into the most holy place was forbidden to all but the high priest; but now access to the real "holy of holies" was granted to all in the name of the great High Priest of the Christian profession.<p>By the blood of Jesus - The blood of Jesus is the means by which this access to heaven is procured. The Jewish high priest entered the holy of holies with the blood of bullocks and of rams (notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>); but the Saviour offered his own blood, and that became the means by which we may have access to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Here begins the third and last division of the Epistle; our duty now while waiting for the Lord's second advent. Resumption and expansion of the exhortation (Heb 4:14-16; compare Heb 10:22, 23 here) wherewith he closed the first part of the Epistle, preparatory to his great doctrinal argument, beginning at Heb 7:1.<p>boldness&#8212;"free confidence," grounded on the consciousness that our sins have been forgiven.<p>to enter&#8212;literally, "as regards the entering."<p>by&#8212;Greek, "in"; it is in the blood of Jesus that our boldness to enter is grounded. Compare Eph 3:12, "In whom we have boldness and access with confidence." It is His having once for all entered as our Forerunner (Heb 6:20) and High Priest (Heb 10:21), making atonement for us with His blood, which is continually there (Heb 12:24) before God, that gives us confident access. No priestly caste now mediates between the sinner and his Judge. We may come boldly with loving confidence, not with slavish fear, directly through Christ, the only mediating Priest. The minister is not officially nearer God than the layman; nor can the latter serve God at a distance or by deputy, as the natural man would like. Each must come for himself, and all are accepted when they come by the new and living way opened by Christ. Thus all Christians are, in respect to access directly to God, virtually high priests (Re 1:6). They draw nigh in and through Christ, the only proper High Priest (Heb 7:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> At this verse the Spirit applieth and maketh use of the doctrine of the great gospel High Priest, and his one all-sufficient sacrifice, and continueth it through part of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/13-1.htm" title="Let brotherly love continue....">Hebrews 13:1-25</a></span>. The transition to it is made by the particle oun, <span class="ital">therefore, </span> which refers to the whole of his doctrinal discourse before of the excellency of the gospel High Priest, for his person, as to both his natures, being God-man, and his sacrifice, with its effects.

How much greater is this gospel privilege than that under the law! Aaron alone, and not the Israelites, could enter into the holy of holiest, and that but once a year, and then with the blood of beasts sacrificed for himself and them; whereas every penitent believing sinner can now by faith in Christ’s blood and prayer, enter into the holiest of all in heaven, and there converse with God every day, while sin hath made him inaccessible to others. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hebrews/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Having therefore, brethren,.... As they were to the apostle, in a natural and civil sense, being Hebrews, as well as in a spiritual relation, being believers in Christ; which is observed, to testify his affection to them, and to engage their regard to the duties hereafter urged, particularly brotherly love, and to signify their common and equal right to the privilege next mentioned, which is <p>boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus: the place saints have boldness to enter into is heaven, called "the holiest", in reference to the holy of holies, in the tabernacle; which was a type of it, for the sacredness and invisibility of it, and for what was in it, went into it, or was brought thither; as the Shechinah, or divine Majesty, which resided there; the high priest who went into it once a year; the blood of sacrifices which was carried into it; the sweet incense; the ark of the testimony, in which was the law; and the mercy seat; all which were typical of Christ, his person, blood, sacrifice, righteousness, intercession, and the grace and mercy which come through him. Heaven was symbolically shut by the sin of man, when he was drove out of the garden of Eden; it was typically opened by the entrance of the high priest into the holy of holies, on the day of atonement; Christ has in person entered into it by his blood, and opened the way for his people; and believers in him may "enter" now, and they do, when they exercise grace on him, who is there, and when they come and present their prayers and praises to God by him; and they have now an actual right to enter into the place itself, and will hereafter enter in person: and the manner of their present entrance is, "with boldness"; which signifies their right unto it, the liberty granted them by God, and the liberty which they sometimes have in their own souls, and great courage and intrepidity of mind; which arises from a sense of remission of sins, as may be concluded from the connection of these words with the preceding; and is found to be true by experience; and such boldness is consistent with reverence, humility, and submission. The way of entrance is "by the blood of Jesus"; and which gives both entrance and boldness; for hereby sin is removed both from the sight of God, and the conscience of the believer; peace is made with God, and spoken to him; pardon is procured, law and justice satisfied, and neither to be feared, and the everlasting covenant confirmed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</span><p>(6) The sum of the former treatise: We are not shut out from the holy place, as the fathers were, but we have an entrance into the true holy place (that is, into heaven) seeing that we are purged with the blood, not of beasts, but of Jesus.

The expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν τῶν ἁγίων ὁδὸν</span>, also favours Weiss’s interpretation. <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἁγίων</span> as the Greek commentators remark, here means “heaven”. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἵματι Ἰησοῦ</span>, on the whole, it is better to join these words not with <span class="greekheb">παρρησίαν</span> but with <span class="greekheb">εἴσοδον</span>. Bleek sees a reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς εἰσέρχεται εἰς τὰ ἅγια ἐν αἵματι ἀλλοτρίῳ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἐνεκαίνισεν ἡμῖν ὁδὸν</span> … “The new and living way which He inaugurated [or dedicated] for us.” The antecedent of the clause is <span class="greekheb">εἴσοδον</span>, and this way into the holiest is here further described as first used by Christ that it might be used by us. For <span class="greekheb">ἐγκαινίζειν</span> means to handsel, to take the first use of a new thing. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm" title="And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>. He has entered within the veil as our <span class="greekheb">πρόδρομος</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-19.htm" title="Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;...">Hebrews 6:19-20</a>) and has thus opened a way for us. It is <span class="greekheb">πρόσφατον</span>, recent, fresh. The lexicographers are agreed that, originally meaning fresh-slain and applied to <span class="greekheb">νεκρός</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρόσφατος</span> came to be used of flowers, oil, snow, misfortune, benefits, in <span class="ital">Sirac.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a>, of a friend; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm" title="The thing that has been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a> <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔστι πᾶν πρόσφατον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον</span>. It was a way recently opened. Christ was the first who trod that way. Wetstein, who gives many examples of the use of the word, cites also from <span class="ital">Floras</span>, i. 15, 3, an interesting analogy: “Alter [Decius Mus] quasi monitu deorum, capite velato, primam ante aciem diis manibus se devoverit, ut in confertissima se hostium tela jaculatus, novum ad victoriam iter sanguinis sui semita aperiret”. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ζῶσαν</span>, not as a way that abides (Chrys., etc.) nor as leading to life eternal (Grotius, etc.), nor as a way which consists in fellowship with a Person (Westcott), but as effective, actually bringing its followers to their goal. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>. So Davidson and Weiss. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ καταπετάσματος</span>, a further characteristic of the way, it passed through the veil, that is, His flesh, which must first be rent before Christ could pass into the holiest. “This beautiful allegorizing of the veil cannot, of course, be made part of a consistent and complete typology. It is not meant for this. But as the veil stood locally before the holiest in the Mosaic Tabernacle, the way into which lay through it, so Christ’s life in the flesh stood between Him and His entrance before God, and His flesh had to be rent ere He could enter” (Davidson).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19–25</span>.

The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("new") applied to the "way" dedicated for us by Christ, though meaning originally, according to its etymology, "newly slain," is commonly used to express "recent" only. And so here. It is a new way in relation to the old one of the high priest through the veil - a way untrodden by man till opened and dedicated by "the <span class="accented">great</span> Priest." The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> ("living") applied to the way distinguishes it, as a spiritual mode of approach, from the old one. "Opponitur <span class="accented">exanimo.</span> Per prosopopoeiam <span class="accented">vita</span> adscribitur <span class="accented">viae</span>, ex ipsa <span class="accented">vita</span> Christi, qui est <span class="accented">Via"</span> (Bengel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). But what is the meaning of the <span class="accented">veil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the word always used of the veil in the tabernacle or temple) being said to be "his flesh "? The idea cannot be simply that he passed through the human nature assumed at his incarnation to the heavenly throne; for the intended counterpart to the high priest's passing through the veil must have been after the completed sacrifice. It is rather that, at the moment of death, when, after saying, "It is finished," he "gave up the ghost," the human flesh (which had through all the ages been as a veil hiding "<span class="accented">the</span> unseen" from man, and behind which Christ himself had "<span class="accented">tabernacled"</span> during his human life) was, as it were, rent asunder and the new way opened. And that this was so was signified by the rending in twain of the veil of the temple from the top to the bottom, mentioned by St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-51.htm">Matthew 26:51</a>), at the very moment of the death upon the cross. This incident may have suggested to the writer the expression used. "<span class="accented">Quum</span> primum Christus per momentum mortis transierat, praesto fuit mera <span class="accented">virtus</span> et <span class="accented">vita.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">carnem suam</span>, quae item scissa est, ut velum" (Bengel). "The house of God" in ver. 21 is a resumption of the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-7</a>, where Christ was shown to be greater than Moses, as being the SON <span class="accented">over</span> the house of God, having (be it observed) been called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 1.
