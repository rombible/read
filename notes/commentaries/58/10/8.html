But when God manifested in the flesh, became the sacrifice, and his death upon the accursed tree the ransom, then the Sufferer being of infinite worth, his free-will sufferings were of infinite value. The atoning sacrifice must be one capable of consenting, and must of his own will place himself in the sinner's stead: Christ did so. The fountain of all that Christ has done for his people, is the sovereign will and grace of God. The righteousness brought in, and the sacrifice once offered by Christ, are of eternal power, and his salvation shall never be done away. They are of power to make all the comers thereunto perfect; they derive from the atoning blood, strength and motives for obedience, and inward comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Above when he said - That is, the Messiah.

That is, "having in the former part of what was quoted said that God did not require sacrifices, in the latter part he says that he came to do the will of God in the place of them."<p>Sacrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings ... - These words are not all used in the Psalm from which the apostle quotes, but the idea is, that the specification there included all kinds of offerings. The apostle dwells upon it because it was important to show that the same remark applied to all the sacrifices which could be offered by man. When the Redeemer made the observation about the inefficacy of sacrifices, he meant that there was none of them which would be sufficient to take away sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. he&#8212;Christ.<p>Sacrifice, &c.&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "Sacrifices and offerings" (plural).

He observes from the Psalm, that the will of God was plainly signified by his Spirit to David under the law, about the nature, state, and design of his institution of sacrifices, that they were typical of, and leading to, a better sacrifice than themselves; and that for their own sake only they were no way acceptable to God, and so rejected by him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hebrews/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Above when he said, ....

Suggestive reference to the imperfection and ineffectiveness of Judaism, since this makes salvation dependent precisely upon those ordinances of external sacrifice which God willed not, and in which He has no pleasure.

The significance of the quotation is now explained. “He takes the first away, that he may establish the second.” He declares the incompetence of the O.T. sacrifices to satisfy the will of God, in order that he may make room for that sacrifice which is permanently to satisfy God. <span class="greekheb">Ἀνώτερον</span>, “Higher up,” here meaning “in the former part of the quotation,” corresponding to and contrasted with <span class="greekheb">τότε</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-9.htm" title="Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God.

Let this <span class="greekheb">אז</span> be the terminus (the point of boundary between the Old and New Testament). Paul also puts, in the first place, the general word of the LXX., <span class="greekheb">εἶπον</span>, then one more significant, <span class="greekheb">εἴρηκεν</span>; whence it is evident, that <span class="greekheb">λέγων</span>, saying, is of the imperfect tense [when He said, or was saying]. But observe how great authority the Psalms possess. The oath of Jehovah was given at the very time when Psalms 110 was written. The solemn invitation was issued to the people when Psalms 95 was written; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-7.htm" title="Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.">Hebrews 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-28.htm" title="For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for ever more.">Hebrews 7:28</a>, note.

So, the Messiah promised to GOD that He would do His will, at the time when Psalms 40 was written.
