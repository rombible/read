It was natural that the two tribes should help one another, because their lots were conterminous; indeed, the lot of the Simeonites is said to lie “<span class= "ital">within </span>the inheritance of the children of Judah” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.">Joshua 19:1</a>), and was given them “out of the portion of the children of Judah” (<span class= "ital">ib., </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-9.htm" title="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Judges 1:9</a>), because a larger territory had been assigned to the tribe of Judah than it required. The tribe of Simeon was remarkable for its fierce valour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/4-24.htm" title="The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul:">1Chronicles 4:24-43</a>), of which we find a trace even in Judith, who belonged to that tribe (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/9-2.htm" title="O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword to take vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted her virginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, It shall not be so; and yet they did so:">Judith 9:2</a>). It would, however, have been helpless without the assistance of Judah; for we see from a comparison of the first with the second census in the Desert that Simeon had decreased in strength from 59,300 to 22,200. This fearful diminution seems to have been due to the plague, which may have fallen most heavily on them from their greater guilt, as we may infer from the shamelessness of their prince Zimri (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm" title="Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.">Numbers 25:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-23.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.">Numbers 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-14.htm" title="These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 26:14</a>). Hence the tribe is omitted in the blessing of Moses (Deuteronomy 33). They seem to have melted away among the nomad tribes of the south, but we see them showing a last flash of vitality in the days of Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm" title="And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and dwelled in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks.">1Chronicles 4:41</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Into my lot</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>into the territory assigned me by lot (“Croesus devasted the <span class= "ital">lots </span>(<span class= "ital">klerous</span>) of the Syrians” (Herod. i. 76). The lots of Judah and Simeon fell within two lines drawn to the Mediterranean from the northern and southern extremities of the Dead Sea (Joshua 15).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-3.htm" title="And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.

In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord said - i. e. answered by Urim and Thummim. The land was the portion which fell to Judah by lot, not the whole land of Canaan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>). The priority given to Judah is a plain indication of divine direction. It points to the birth of our Lord of the tribe of Judah.

The men of the tribe of Judah said to those of the tribe of Simeon, they being not only brethren by father's and mother's side, which was not the case of all the sons of Jacob, but their possessions and inheritances lay near together; and indeed those of Simeon were within the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>; so that as they lived in great nearness and familiarity with each other, their interests were closely united together: <p>come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; conjunctly: the meaning is, that the tribe of Simeon, as many of their warlike men as could, would come and join their forces with those of the tribe of Judah, in order to reduce such cities, in the lot of that tribe, the Canaanites as yet were in the possession of: <p>and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot: the cities being conquered which were in the lot, of the tribe of Judah, that tribe proposed to bring their united forces into the lot of the tribe of Simeon, and reduce such cities as were in that lot: <p>so Simeon went with him: the tribe of Simeon agreed to the proposal, and went along with the tribe of Judah against their common enemy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Judah said unto Simeon his <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot.

Owing to this tie of kinship, and still more to the fact that it was never strong enough to maintain itself as a distinct tribe, Simeon became merged in Judah. Its settlements were in the south, within the territory of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah....">Joshua 19:1-7</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/15-26.htm" title="Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,...">Joshua 15:26-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-42.htm" title="Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,">Joshua 15:42</a> these are even reckoned as Judahite.

He did not formally lay down his office, because there was no immediate successor who had been appointed by God. The ordinary rulers of the congregation were enough, when once they were settled in Canaan, viz., the elders as heads and judges of the nation, together with the high priest, who represented the nation in its relation to God, and could obtain for it the revelation of the will of God through the right of the Urim and Thummim. In order therefore to bring the history of Joshua and his times to a close, nothing further remained than to give an account of his death, with a short reference to the fruit of his labours, and to add certain other notices for which no suitable place had hitherto presented itself.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29-30</a><p>Soon after these events (vv. 1-28) Joshua died, at the age of 110, like his ancestor Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-26.htm">Genesis 50:26</a>), and was buried in his hereditary possessions at Timnath-serah, upon the mountains of Ephraim, to the north of Mount Gaash.
