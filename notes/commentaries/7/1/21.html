(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm" title="Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.">Judges 1:8</a>.) Jerusalem was on the borders of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-8.htm" title="The border went out from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.">Joshua 16:8</a>) and Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-28.htm" title="And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelled therein.">Judges 18:28</a>). It belongs more properly to the latter, but the conquest of Zion by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm" title="Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.">2Samuel 5:7</a>) naturally caused its closer identification with Judah. The Jebusites were tolerated inhabitants ever after this conquest, and had their own prince—Araunah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-18.htm" title="And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, raise an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.">2Samuel 24:18</a>)—“Araunah the king.” We even find traces of them after the exile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm" title="Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.">Ezra 9:1</a>). Jerusalem is a remarkable exception to the rule that the Israelites conquered “the hill-country,” but not the plain.<p><span class= "bld">Unto this day.</span>—The assignment of Jerusalem to Benjamin shows that <span class= "ital">this </span>narrative, though not contemporaneous, is older than the conquest of Jerusalem by David.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:21-36 The people of Israel were very careless of their duty and interest. Owing to slothfulness and cowardice, they would not be at the pains to complete their conquests. It was also owing to their covetousness: they were willing to let the Canaanites live among them, that they might make advantage of them. They had not the dread and detestation of idolatry they ought to have had. The same unbelief that kept their fathers forty years out of Canaan, kept them now out of the full possession of it. Distrust of the power and promise of God deprived them of advantages, and brought them into troubles. Thus many a believer who begins well is hindered. His graces languish, his lusts revive, Satan plies him with suitable temptations, the world recovers its hold; he brings guilt into his conscience, anguish into his heart, discredit on his character, and reproach on the gospel. Though he may have sharp rebukes, and be so recovered that he does not perish, yet he will have deeply to lament his folly through his remaining days; and upon his dying bed to mourn over the opportunities of glorifying God and serving the church he has lost. We can have no fellowship with the enemies of God within us or around us, but to our hurt; therefore our only wisdom is to maintain unceasing war against them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This verse is nearly identical with <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>, except in the substitution of Benjamin for Judah.

That is, that part of it which belonged to them, for it lay between Judah and Benjamin; and neither of them separately, nor both conjunctly, could drive out the Jebusites from it, particularly the strong hold on the top of Mount Sion, which they held to the times of David. Abarbinel is of opinion, that Jerusalem in those times was not a city enclosed about, but was a large province, part of which belonged to the tribe of Judah, and another to the tribe of Benjamin, and another was possessed by the Jebusites; and so Jarchi says it was a province, the name of which was Jebusi: <p>but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin unto this day; when this book was written, which was done by Samuel, as Kimchi and Ben Gersom; and it is certain from hence it must have been written before the reign of David, who dispossessed the Jebusites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</span><p>(k) For after the tribe of Judah had burnt it, they built it again.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>.

The boundary line between Judah and Jerusalem passed through JEBUS or JEBUSI, as Jerusalem was anciently called (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4, 5</a>).
