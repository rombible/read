It is here added that he was Caleb’s younger brother.

The Hebrew may mean either that Othniel was “son of Kenaz and brother of Caleb” (in which case he married his niece); or “son of Kenaz, who was Caleb’s brother” (as in “Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm" title="But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.">2Samuel 13:3</a>), in which case Achsah was his cousin. The Masoretes, to whom is due the punctuation, &c., of our Hebrew Scriptures, show by their pointing that they understood the words in the <span class= "ital">former </span>sense. But though Ben-kenaz may simply mean Kenezite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm" title="Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.">Numbers 32:12</a>), it is strange in that case that Othniel should never be called a son of Jephunneh. If he was a brother of Caleb’s, he must have lived to extreme old age, and have been an old man when he married Achsah. For the importance of Caleb’s family, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-15.htm" title="The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:15</a>.

It is here said to have been taken, smitten with the edge of the sword, and burned, by the children of Judah. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/12-8.htm">Joshua 12:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-10.htm">Joshua 12:10</a> the Jebusite and the king of Jerusalem are enumerated among Joshua's conquests, but without any distinct mention of the capture of the city; and in the marginal reference we read that the Jebusites were not expelled from Jerusalem, but dwelt with the children of Judah (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>). Further, we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10-12</a> that Jerusalem was wholly a Jebusite city in the lifetime of Phinehas <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>, and so it continued until the reign of David <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>. The conclusion is that Jerusalem was only taken once, namely, at the time here described, and that this was in the lifetime of Joshua; but that the children of Judah did not occupy it in sufficient force to prevent the return of the Jebusites, who gradually recovered complete possession.<p>Set the city on fire - A phrase found only at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it&#8212;The capture of this important city, which ranks among the early incidents in the war of invasion (Jos 15:63), is here noticed to account for its being in the possession of the Judahites; and they brought Adoni-bezek thither [Jud 1:7], in order, probably, that his fate being rendered so public, might inspire terror far and wide. Similar inroads were made into the other unconquered parts of Judah's inheritance [Jud 1:9-11]. The story of Caleb's acquisition of Hebron is here repeated (Jos 15:16-19).

B) or the brother (LXX. cod. A, Vulgate) of Caleb; but tradition favours the latter alternative. Elsewhere, though in later documents, Caleb is styled ‘the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite’ Josh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-14.htm" title="Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.">Joshua 14:14</a> D; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm" title="Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.">Numbers 32:12</a> P.

As a tribal name Othniel may be compared with Israel and Jeraḥmeel. Caleb was closely connected with Jeraḥmeel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-9.htm" title="The sons also of Hezron, that were born to him; Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai.">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-25.htm" title="And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.">1 Chronicles 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-42.htm" title="Now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were, Mesha his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron.">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-49.htm" title="She bore also Shaaph the father of Madmannah, Sheva the father of Machbenah, and the father of Gibea: and the daughter of Caleb was Achsa.">1 Chronicles 2:49</a>), a clan settled in the Negeb, S. of Caleb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-10.htm" title="And Achish said, Where have you made a road to day?

The present story gives the tribal traditions under the guise of a narrative dealing with individuals (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-3.htm" title="And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.

So far as the sense is concerned, Rosenmller has given the correct explanation of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, "Judah entered upon the expedition along with Simeon." "And they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites in Bezek, 10,000 men." The result of the war is summed up briefly in these words; and then in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-5.htm">Judges 1:5-7</a> the capture and punishment of the hostile king Adoni-bezek is specially mentioned as being the most important event in the war. The foe is described as consisting of Canaanites and Perizzites, two tribes which have been already named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a> as representing the entire population of Canaan, "the Canaanites" comprising principally those in the lowlands by the Jordan and the Mediterranean (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>), and "the Perizzites" the tribes who dwelt in the mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-15.htm">Joshua 17:15</a>). On the Perizzites, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>. The place mentioned, Bezek, is only mentioned once more, namely in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-8.htm">1 Samuel 11:8</a>, where it is described as being situated between Gibeah of Saul (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>) and Jabesh in Gilead. According to the Onom. (s. v. Bezek), there were at that time two places very near together both named Bezek, seventeen Roman miles from Neapolis on the road to Scythopolis, i.e., about seven hours to the north of Nabulus on the road to Beisan. This description is perfectly reconcilable with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-8.htm">1 Samuel 11:8</a>. On the other hand, Clericus (ad h. l.), Rosenmller, and v. Raumer suppose the Bezek mentioned here to have been situated in the territory of Judah; though this cannot be proved, since it is merely based upon an inference drawn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3</a>, viz., that Judah and Simeon simply attacked the Canaanites in their own allotted territories-an assumption which is very uncertain. There is no necessity, however, to adopt the opposite and erroneous opinion of Bertheau, that the tribes of Judah and Simeon commenced their expedition to the south from the gathering-place of the united tribes at Shechem, and fought the battle with the Canaanitish forces in that region upon this expedition; since Shechem is not described in Josha as the gathering-place of the united tribes, i.e., of the whole of the military force of Israel, and the battle fought with Adoni-bezek did not take place at the time when the tribes prepared to leave Shiloh and march to their own possessions after the casting of the lots was over. The simplest explanation is, that when the tribes of Judah and Simeon prepared to make war upon the Canaanites in the possessions allotted to them, they were threatened or attacked by the forces of the Canaanites collected together by Adoni-bezek, so that they had first of all to turn their arms against this king before they could attack the Canaanites in their own tribe-land. As the precise circumstances connected with the occasion and course of this war have not been recorded, there is nothing to hinder the supposition that Adoni-bezek may have marched from the north against the possession of Benjamin and Judah, possibly with the intention of joining the Canaanites in Jebus, and the Anakim in Hebron and upon the mountains in the south, and then making a combined attack upon the Israelites. This might induce or even compel Judah and Simeon to attack this enemy first of all, and even to pursue him till they overtook him at his capital Bezek, and smote him with all his army. Adoni-bezek, i.e., lord of Bezek, is the official title of this king, whose proper name is unknown.<p>In the principal engagement, in which 10,000 Canaanites fell, Adoni-bezek escaped; but he was overtaken in his flight (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-6.htm">Judges 1:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>), and so mutilated, by the cutting off of his thumbs and great toes, that he could neither carry arms nor flee. With this cruel treatment, which the Athenians are said to have practised upon the capture Aegynetes (Aelian, var. hist. ii. 9), the Israelites simply executed the just judgment of retribution, as Adoni-bezek was compelled to acknowledge, for the cruelties which he had inflicted upon captives taken by himself. "Seventy kings," he says in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>, "with the thumbs of their hands and feet cut off, were gathering under my table. As I have done, so God hath requited me." &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;  ...  &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, lit. "cut in the thumbs of their hands and feet" (see Ewald, Lehrb. 284 c.). The object to &#1502;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, "gathering up" (viz., crumbs), is easily supplied from the idea of the verb itself. Gathering up crumbs under the table, like the dogs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm">Matthew 15:27</a>, is a figurative representation of the most shameful treatment and humiliation. "Seventy" is a round number, and is certainly an exaggerated hyperbole here. For even if every town of importance in Canaan had its own king, the fact that, when Joshua conquered the land, he only smote thirty-one kings, is sufficient evidence that there can hardly have been seventy kings to be found in all Canaan. It appears strange, too, that the king of Bezek is not mentioned in connection with the conquest of Canaan under Joshua. Bezek was probably situated more on the side towards the valley of the Jordan, where the Israelites under Joshua did not go. Possibly, too, the culminating point of Adoni-bezek's power, when he conquered so many kings, was before the arrival of the Israelites in Canaan, and it may at that time have begun to decline; so that he did not venture to undertake anything against the combined forces of Israel under Joshua, and it was not till the Israelitish tribes separated to go to their own possessions, that he once more tried the fortunes of war and was defeated. The children of Judah took him with them to Jerusalem, where he died. </body></html>
