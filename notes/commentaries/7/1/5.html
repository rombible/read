In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Canaanites and the Perizzites - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>, note.

Barbarities of various kinds were commonly practised on prisoners of war in ancient times, and the object of this particular mutilation of the hands and feet was to disable them for military service ever after. The infliction of such a horrid cruelty on this Canaanite chief would have been a foul stain on the character of the Israelites if there were not reason for believing it was done by them as an act of retributive justice, and as such it was regarded by Adoni-bezek himself, whose conscience read his atrocious crimes in their punishment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Adoni-bezek; </span> the lord or king of Bezek, as his name signifies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in Bezek; </span> whither he fled, when he had lost the field. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against him, </span> i.e. against the city wherein he had encamped himself, and the rest of his army. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek,....

No proper names in the O.T. are compounded with the name of a place; and by all analogy Adoni-bezek must mean ‘(the god) Bezek is Lord.’ A god Bezek, however, is unknown. The double Bezek excites suspicion: <span class="ital">in Bezek</span> may be allowed to stand, because the context requires the name of a place; the error probably lies in the name of the chief. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that Adoni-bezek here is the same person as Adoni-zedek in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;">Joshua 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm" title="Why Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,">Joshua 10:3</a>, the head of the Canaanite confederacy which is said to have opposed the Israelite invasion after the capture of Ai. Advancing from Gilgal or Jericho the first stronghold to confront the invaders would be Jerusalem; and by correcting ‘Adoni-bezek’ to <span class="ital">Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem</span>, the form in which Joshua gives the text, we obtain the right situation for Judah’s first encounter. The name Adoni-zedek (cf. the Hebrew Adoni-jah and the Phoenician Adoni-eshmun) means <span class="ital">Zedek</span>, or rather <span class="ital">Ṣedeḳ, is Lord</span>, Zedek being the Canaanite (Phoen.) god <span class="greekheb">Συδέκ</span> (Philo Bybl., <span class="ital">Fragm.

Probably the Hebrew scribes altered the name in order to introduce a distinction between the two narratives in Jud. and Josh.; ‘Bezek’ suggested itself from the context; and the whole name was given the erroneous meaning ‘lord of Bezek.’ The Greek scribes, on the other hand, identified the two names by reading Adoni-bezek both in Josh, and in Jud. (LXX). Another way of accounting for the alteration is proposed by Moore: by changing Adoni-zedek to Adoni-bezek it was possible to give the name a contemptuous twist, ‘the Lord scatters’; in Aram. <span class="ital">bezaḳ</span> = ‘scatter.’ The situation of the town Bezek is unknown, but it was probably near Jerusalem, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm" title="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me.

Possibly the name has not been preserved correctly; Azekah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm" title="And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.">Joshua 10:10</a>) is suggested as an improvement (Steuernagel, <span class="ital">Einwanderung</span>, p. 85).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Canaanites and the Perizzites</span>] Cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-4.htm" title="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Jdg 1:4</a></span>; mentioned together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm" title="And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.">Genesis 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm" title="And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.">Genesis 34:30</a> J; both appear in the lists of the seven nations of Canaan, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm" title="When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you;">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>.

During his own lifetime, and that of the elders who outlived him, and who had seen all that the Lord did for Israel, all Israel served the Lord. "The elders" are the rulers and leaders of the nation. The account of the burial of Joseph's bones, which the Israelites had brought with them from Egypt to Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>), is placed after the account of Joshua's death, because it could not have been introduced before without interrupting the connected account of the labours of Joshua; and it would not do to pass it over without notice altogether, not only because the fact of their bringing the bones with them had been mentioned in the book of Exodus, but also because the Israelites thereby fulfilled the promise given by their fathers to Joseph when he died. The burial of Joseph in the piece of field which Jacob had purchased at Shechem (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>) had no doubt taken place immediately after the division of the land, when Joseph's descendants received Shechem and the field there for an inheritance. This piece of field, however, they chose for a burial-place for Joseph's bones, not only because Jacob had purchased it, but in all probability chiefly because Jacob had sanctified it for his descendants by building an altar there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>). The death and burial of Eleazar, who stood by Joshua's side in the guidance of the nation, are mentioned last of all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-33.htm">Joshua 24:33</a>). When Eleazar died, whether shortly before or shortly after Joshua, cannot be determined. He was buried at Gibeah of Phinehas, the place which was given to him upon the mountains of Ephraim, i.e., as his inheritance. Gibeath Phinehas, i.e., hill of Phinehas, is apparently a proper name, like Gibeah of Saul (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-34.htm">1 Samuel 15:34</a>, etc.). The situation, however, is uncertain. According to Eusebius (Onom. s. v. &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;), it was upon the mountains of Ephraim, in the tribe of Benjamin, and was at that time a place named Gabatha, the name also given to it by Josephus (Ant. v. 1, 29), about twelve Roman miles from Eleutheropolis. This statement is certainly founded upon an error, at least so far as the number twelve is concerned. It is a much more probable supposition, that it is the Levitical town Geba of Benjamin, on the north-east of Ramah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>), and the name Gibeah of Phinehas might be explained on the ground that this place had become the hereditary property of Phinehas, which would be perfectly reconcilable with its selection as one of the priests' cities. As the priests, for example, were not the sole possessors of the towns ceded to them in the possessions of the different tribes, the Israelites might have presented Phinehas with that portion of the city which was not occupied by the priests, and also with the field, as a reward for the services he had rendered to the congregation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7</a>.), just as Caleb and Joshua had been specially considered; in which case Phinehas might dwell in his own hereditary possessions in a priests' city. The situation, "upon the mountains of Ephraim," is not at variance with this view, as these mountains extended, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>, etc., far into the territory of Benjamin (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>). The majority of commentators, down to Knobel, have thought the place intended to be a Gibeah in the tribe of Ephraim, namely the present Jeeb or Jibia, by the Wady Jib, on the north of Guphna, towards Neapolis (Sichem: see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 80), though there is nothing whatever to favour this except the name.<p>With the death of Eleazar the high priest, the contemporary of Joshua, the times of Joshua came to a close, so that the account of Eleazar's death formed a very fitting termination to the book. In some MSS and editions of the Septuagint, there is an additional clause relating to the high priest Phinehas and the apostasy of the Israelites after Joshua's death; but this is merely taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-12.htm">Joshua 3:12</a>., and arbitrarily appended to the book of Joshua.</body></html>
