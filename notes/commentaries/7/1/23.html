Owing to slothfulness and cowardice, they would not be at the pains to complete their conquests. It was also owing to their covetousness: they were willing to let the Canaanites live among them, that they might make advantage of them. They had not the dread and detestation of idolatry they ought to have had. The same unbelief that kept their fathers forty years out of Canaan, kept them now out of the full possession of it. Distrust of the power and promise of God deprived them of advantages, and brought them into troubles. Thus many a believer who begins well is hindered. His graces languish, his lusts revive, Satan plies him with suitable temptations, the world recovers its hold; he brings guilt into his conscience, anguish into his heart, discredit on his character, and reproach on the gospel. Though he may have sharp rebukes, and be so recovered that he does not perish, yet he will have deeply to lament his folly through his remaining days; and upon his dying bed to mourn over the opportunities of glorifying God and serving the church he has lost. We can have no fellowship with the enemies of God within us or around us, but to our hurt; therefore our only wisdom is to maintain unceasing war against them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bethel was within the borders of Benjamin, but was captured, as we here learn, by the house of Joseph, who probably retained it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 1:22-26.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-2.htm" title="And goes out from Bethel to Luz, and passes along to the borders of Archi to Ataroth,">Joshua 16:2</a> JE the two places are distinguished, ‘from Beth-el to Luz’; but the text is uncertain, and in the LXX the two are usually identified. Luz is supposed to mean ‘almond-tree’; more suggestively Winckler proposes ‘asylum,’ from the Arab <span class="ital">lâdha</span> ‘to seek a refuge’ (<span class="ital">Gesch. Isr.</span> 2:65 f.). If the latter is right, Luz may have been a sanctuary before it became famous under the name of Beth-el. According to JE the place was called Beth-el because Jacob set up a stone there after his vision when he fled from Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/28-10.htm" title="And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran....">Genesis 28:10-22</a>); according to P, because God appeared to him there when he returned from Paddan-aram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/35-9.htm" title="And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him....">Genesis 35:9-15</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bethel</span>, now Beitin. The name (house of God) had been given by Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), but obviously would not be likely to be adopted by the Canaanitish inhabitants, by whom it was called Luz. As soon, however, as the Ephraimites conquered it, they reimposed the name, in memory of their father Jacob. The Saxon charters exhibit an analogous change in such transitions of name, as that from <span class="accented">Bedericksworth</span> to <span class="accented">Bury St. Edmunds</span>, which took place after the transfer of St. Edmund's body to the church there, the old name continuing for a time along with the new one, but at last disappearing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Remaining Conquests of the Combined Tribes of Judah and Simeon. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>.<p>Zephath was in the territory of Simeon. This is evident not only from the fact that Hormah (Zephath) had been allotted to the tribe of Simeon (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-30.htm">Joshua 15:30</a>), but also from the words, "Judah went with Simeon his brother," which point back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3</a>, and express the thought that Judah went with Simeon into his territory to drive out the Canaanites who were still to be found there. Going southwards from Debir, Judah and Simeon smote the Canaanites at Zephath on the southern boundary of Canaan, and executed the ban upon this town, from which it received the name of Hormah, i.e., banning. The town has been preserved in the ruins of Septa, on the south of Khalasa or Elusa (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>). In the passage mentioned, the king of Hormah or Zephath is named among the kings who were slain by Joshua. It does not follow from this, however, that Joshua must necessarily have conquered his capital Zephath; the king of Jerusalem was also smitten by Joshua and slain, without Jerusalem itself being taken at that time. But even if Zephath were taken by the Israelites, as soon as the Israelitish army had withdrawn, the Canaanites there might have taken possession of the town again; so that, like many other Canaanitish towns, it had to be conquered again after Joshua's death (see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2-3</a>). There is not much probability in this conjecture, however, for the simple reason that the ban pronounced by Moses upon the country of the king of Arad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2</a>) was carried out now for the first time by Judah and Simeon upon the town of Zephath, which formed a part of it. If Joshua had conquered it, he would certainly have executed the ban upon it. The name Hormah, which was already given to Zephath in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-30.htm">Joshua 15:30</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>, is no proof to the contrary, since it may be used proleptically there. In any case, the infliction of the ban upon this town can only be explained from the fact that Moses had pronounced the ban upon all the towns of the king of Arad.</body></html>
