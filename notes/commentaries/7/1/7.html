The “seventy” kings may have been the rulers of the towns which Adoni-bezek had taken in extending the territory of Bezek. Josephus says seventy-two kings (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 2, § 2), and this common variation is found in some MSS. of the LXX. The Persians treated their Greek captives in this way (Curtius, v. 5,6). Mutilation in the East was so common that it was hardly accounted cruel (Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. i.</span> 9-13). Cutting off the hand or foot was the prescribed Mohammedan punishment for theft in British India (Mill, iii. 447), and many mutilated persons are still to be seen in Northern Scinde (see Grote’s <span class= "ital">Greece, </span>xii. 235).<p><span class= "bld">Gathered their meat under my table.</span>—The words “their meat” are wanting in the original. Adoni-bezek, with cruel insolence, treated these subject Sheykhs like dogs “which eat of the fragments that fall from the table of their lords” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm" title="And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.">Matthew 15:27</a>). Posidonius says that the king of Parthia used to fling food to his courtiers, who seized it like dogs (Athen. 4:152). The existence of these feuds among the Canaanites would render the task of the Israelites more easy.<p><span class= "bld">As I have done, so God hath requited me.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm" title="And he said, They were my brothers, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you.">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.

We must not suppose that this Canaanite prince worshipped Jehovah, but only that he recognised generally that a Divine retribution had overtaken him. It is one of the commonest facts of history that<p>“Even-handed justice<p>Commends the ingredients of the poisoned chalice<p>To our own lips.”<p>This truth, “that wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be punished,” is magnificently, if somewhat fancifully, worked out in Wisdom 11, 17, 18<p><span class= "bld">They brought him to Jerusalem.</span>—Rabbi Tanchum, author of the celebrated traditional Midrash (or “exposition”), says that this notice must <span class= "ital">be prospective, i.e., </span>it must refer to a time subsequent to the conquest of Jerusalem mentioned in the next verse. It may, however, merely mean that they kept him with them in their camp when they advanced to the siege of Jerusalem; or the “<span class= "ital">they</span>” may refer to his own people. The Israelites may have contemptuously spared his life, and suffered him to join his own people, as a living monument of God’s vengeance. In any case the name Jerusalem is used by anticipation, for it seems to have been called Jebus till the days of David.

In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Threescore and ten kings - We may infer from this number of conquered kings, that the intestine wars of the Canaanites were among the causes which, under God's Providence, weakened their resistance to the Israelites. Adoni-Bezek's cruelty to the subject kings was the cause of his receiving (compare the marginal references) this chastisement. The loss of the thumb would make a man unfit to handle a sword or a bow; the loss of his big toe would impede his speed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Threescore and ten kings&#8212;So great a number will not appear strange, when it is considered that anciently every ruler of a city or large town was called a king. It is not improbable that in that southern region of Canaan, there might, in earlier times, have been even more till a turbulent chief like Adoni-bezek devoured them in his insatiable ambition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Threescore and ten kings; </span> which is not strange in those times and places; for these might be either, first, kings successively, and so there might be divers of those kings in one place, and so in others; or, secondly, contemporary kings. For it is well known that anciently each ruler of a city, or great town, was called a king, and had kingly power in that place; and many such kings we meet with in Canaan; and it is probable that some years before kings were more numerous there, till the greater devoured many of the less. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Having their thumbs cut off, </span> that so their hands might be unable to manage weapons of war. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gathered their meat under my table; </span> an act of barbarous inhumanity thus to insult over the miserable, joined with abominable luxury. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">God hath requited me:</span> he acknowledgeth the providence and vindictive justice of God, which also Pharaoh did, and others too, without any true sense of piety. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They brought him; </span> they carried him in triumph, as a monument of God’s righteous vengeance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To Jerusalem; </span> it being the metropolis of the nation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Adonibezek said,....

A short time before his death, Joshua had gathered the elders and heads of the people around him, and set before them the entire destruction of the Canaanites through the omnipotent help of the Lord, if they would only adhere with fidelity to the Lord; whilst, at the same time, he also pointed out to them the dangers of apostasy from the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23.htm">Joshua 23</a>). Remembering this admonition and warning, the Israelites inquired, after Joshua's death, who should begin the war against the Canaanites who still remained to be destroyed; and the Lord answered, "Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-2.htm">Judges 1:2</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, to ask with Jehovah for the purpose of obtaining a declaration of the divine will, is substantially the same as &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>), to inquire the will of the Lord through the Urim and Thummim of the high priest. From this time forward inquiring of the Lord occurs with greater frequency (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-23.htm">Judges 20:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-10.htm">1 Samuel 22:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>, etc.), as well as the synonymous expression "ask of Elohim" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-37.htm">1 Samuel 14:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-10.htm">1 Chronicles 14:10</a>; whereas Moses and Joshua received direct revelations from God.

Moreover, &#1502;&#1497; does not mean who? i.e., what person, but, as the answer clearly shows, what tribe? Now a tribe could open the war, and take the lead at the head of the other tribes, but could not be the commander-in-chief. In the present instance, however, Judah did not even enter upon the war at the head of all the tribes, but simply joined with the tribe of Simeon to make a common attack upon the Canaanites in their inheritance. The promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-2.htm">Judges 1:2</a> is the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>, etc. "The land" is not merely the land allotted to the tribe of Judah, or Judah's inheritance, as Bertheau supposes, for Judah conquered Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>), which had been allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>), but the land of Canaan generally, so far as it was still in the possession of the Canaanites and was to be conquered by Judah. The reason why Judah was to commence the hostilities is not to be sought for in the fact that Judah was the most numerous of all the tribes (Rosenmller), but rather in the fact that Judah had already been appointed by the blessing of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8</a>.) to be the champion of his brethren. </body></html>
