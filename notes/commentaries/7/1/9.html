It is here said to have been taken, smitten with the edge of the sword, and burned, by the children of Judah. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/12-8.htm">Joshua 12:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-10.htm">Joshua 12:10</a> the Jebusite and the king of Jerusalem are enumerated among Joshua's conquests, but without any distinct mention of the capture of the city; and in the marginal reference we read that the Jebusites were not expelled from Jerusalem, but dwelt with the children of Judah (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>). Further, we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10-12</a> that Jerusalem was wholly a Jebusite city in the lifetime of Phinehas <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>, and so it continued until the reign of David <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>. The conclusion is that Jerusalem was only taken once, namely, at the time here described, and that this was in the lifetime of Joshua; but that the children of Judah did not occupy it in sufficient force to prevent the return of the Jebusites, who gradually recovered complete possession.<p>Set the city on fire - A phrase found only at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it&#8212;The capture of this important city, which ranks among the early incidents in the war of invasion (Jos 15:63), is here noticed to account for its being in the possession of the Judahites; and they brought Adoni-bezek thither [Jud 1:7], in order, probably, that his fate being rendered so public, might inspire terror far and wide. Similar inroads were made into the other unconquered parts of Judah's inheritance [Jud 1:9-11]. The story of Caleb's acquisition of Hebron is here repeated (Jos 15:16-19).

The epithet is applied to Simeon, not because Simeon and Judah, the sons of Jacob, were the children of the same mother, Leah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-33.htm">Genesis 29:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>), but because Simeon's inheritance was within the territory of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>.), so that Simeon was more closely connected with Judah than any of the other tribes. "Come up with me into my lot (into the inheritance that has fallen to me by lot), that we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him," i.e., joined with Judah in making war upon the Canaanites. This request shows that Judah's principal intention was to make war upon and exterminate the Canaanites who remained in his own and Simeon's inheritance. The different expressions employed, come up and go, are to be explained from the simple fact that the whole of Simeon's territory was in the shephelah and Negeb, whereas Judah had received the heart of his possessions upon the mountains. </body></html>
