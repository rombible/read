St. Augustine had the same reading. It is, however, possible that “not” may have been conjecturally added because of the apparent discrepancy between this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm" title="Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.">Judges 3:8</a>; or, again, “did not inherit” may be a sort of explanatory gloss on the “took.” Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 2, § 4) says that Askelon and Ashdod were taken in the war, but that Gaza and Ekron escaped, because their situation in the plains enabled them to use their chariots; yet in 3, § 1, he says that the Canaanites <span class= "ital">re-conquered </span>Askelon and Ekron. In any case, the conquest was very transitory. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-22.htm" title="There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.">Joshua 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm" title="Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelled in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entering in of Hamath.">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Judges 3:13</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-18.htm" title="Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.">Jdg 1:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Judah also took Gaza, Askelon, and Ekron — </span>These three cities were in the country of the Philistines, upon the sea-coast, and the Israelites did not hold them long before the Philistines recovered them again.

Israel let them fix where they pleased, being a quiet, contented people. They that molested none, were molested by none.

(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a> note.) It is a curious fact that when Rameses III took Askelon it was occupied, not by Philistines, but apparently by Hebrews. Rameses began to reign in 1269 B.C., and reigned 25 years. At any time between 1269 and 1244 B.C. such occupation of Askelon by Hebrews agrees with the Book of Judges. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-29.

The LXX reads ‘and Judah did not dispossess’ (a different word from ‘took’), and other versions insert the negative; this seems to get over the difficulty; but the LXX version here has little critical value.
