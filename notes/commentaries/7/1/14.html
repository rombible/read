It is here said to have been taken, smitten with the edge of the sword, and burned, by the children of Judah. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/12-8.htm">Joshua 12:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-10.htm">Joshua 12:10</a> the Jebusite and the king of Jerusalem are enumerated among Joshua's conquests, but without any distinct mention of the capture of the city; and in the marginal reference we read that the Jebusites were not expelled from Jerusalem, but dwelt with the children of Judah (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>). Further, we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10-12</a> that Jerusalem was wholly a Jebusite city in the lifetime of Phinehas <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>, and so it continued until the reign of David <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>. The conclusion is that Jerusalem was only taken once, namely, at the time here described, and that this was in the lifetime of Joshua; but that the children of Judah did not occupy it in sufficient force to prevent the return of the Jebusites, who gradually recovered complete possession.<p>Set the city on fire - A phrase found only at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it&#8212;The capture of this important city, which ranks among the early incidents in the war of invasion (Jos 15:63), is here noticed to account for its being in the possession of the Judahites; and they brought Adoni-bezek thither [Jud 1:7], in order, probably, that his fate being rendered so public, might inspire terror far and wide. Similar inroads were made into the other unconquered parts of Judah's inheritance [Jud 1:9-11]. The story of Caleb's acquisition of Hebron is here repeated (Jos 15:16-19).

The Septuagint reads, "Othniel urged her to ask the field of her father," and the Vulgate has, "Her husband told her to ask her father," and then it follows naturally, "and she lighted from off her ass," etc. But the Hebrew reading may be right, and it may be that when her husband, brave in storming a city, but timid in asking a favour, hung back, she, with the tenacious will of a woman, sprang off the ass herself, and successfully preferred her request. Dean Stanley identifies (though not with absolute certainty) the "field thus obtained by Achsah with an unusually green valley amidst the dry, barren hills of the south country, lying south or west of Hebron, called Wady Nuukur, through which Caleb and Achsah must have ridden on their way from Hebron to Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This valley breaks into a precipitous and still greener ravine, and both the upper and lower pastures are watered by a clear, bubbling rivulet, which rises in the upper meadow, and flows to the bottom of the ravine below. The name of a village, <span class="accented">Dewir</span>, seems to represent the ancient <span class="accented">Debir.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After his defeat, Judah and Simeon went against Jerusalem, and conquered this city and smote it, i.e., its inhabitants, with the edge of the sword, or without quarter (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-26.htm">Genesis 34:26</a>), and set the city on fire. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, to set on fire, to give up to the flames, only occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>. Joshua had already slain the king of Jerusalem and his four allies after the battle at Gibeon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-18.htm">Joshua 10:18-26</a>), but had not conquered Jerusalem, his capital. This was not done till after Joshua's death, when it was taken by the tribes of Judah and Simeon. But even after this capture, and notwithstanding the fact that it had been set on fire, it did not come into the sole and permanent possession of the Israelites. After the conquerors had advanced still farther, to make war upon the Canaanites in the mountains, in the Negeb, and in the shephelah (vv. 9ff.), the Jebusites took it again and rebuilt it, so that in the following age it was regarded by the Israelites as a foreign city (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-11.htm">Judges 19:11-12</a>). The Benjaminites, to whom Jerusalem had fallen by lot, were no more able to drive out the Jebusites than the Judaeans had been. Consequently they continued to live by the side of the Benjaminites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>) and the Judaeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>), who settled, as time rolled on, in this the border city of their possessions; and in the upper town especially, upon the top of Mount Zion, they established themselves so firmly, that they could not be dislodged until David succeeded in wresting this fortress from them, and make the city of Zion the capital of his kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>.).<p>(Note: In this way we may reconcile in a very simple manner the different accounts concerning Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-11.htm">Judges 19:11</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-54.htm">1 Samuel 17:54</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5-6</a>, without there being the slightest necessity to restrict the conquest mentioned in this verse to the city that was built round Mount Zion, as Josephus does, to the exclusion of the citadel upon Zion itself; or to follow Bertheau, and refer the account of the Jebusites dwelling by the children of Judah in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>) to a time subsequent to the conquest of the citadel of Zion by David-an interpretation which is neither favoured by the circumstance that the Jebusite Araunah still held some property there in the time of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-21.htm">2 Samuel 24:21</a>.), nor by the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>., according to which the descendants of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites who still remained in the land were made into tributary bondmen by Solomon, and set to work upon the buildings that he had in hand.)</body></html>
