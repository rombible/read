Owing to slothfulness and cowardice, they would not be at the pains to complete their conquests. It was also owing to their covetousness: they were willing to let the Canaanites live among them, that they might make advantage of them. They had not the dread and detestation of idolatry they ought to have had. The same unbelief that kept their fathers forty years out of Canaan, kept them now out of the full possession of it. Distrust of the power and promise of God deprived them of advantages, and brought them into troubles. Thus many a believer who begins well is hindered. His graces languish, his lusts revive, Satan plies him with suitable temptations, the world recovers its hold; he brings guilt into his conscience, anguish into his heart, discredit on his character, and reproach on the gospel. Though he may have sharp rebukes, and be so recovered that he does not perish, yet he will have deeply to lament his folly through his remaining days; and upon his dying bed to mourn over the opportunities of glorifying God and serving the church he has lost. We can have no fellowship with the enemies of God within us or around us, but to our hurt; therefore our only wisdom is to maintain unceasing war against them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The site of this new Luz is not known, but "the land of the Hittites" was apparently in the north of Palestine, on the borders of Syria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-36. The same course of subjugation was carried on in the other tribes to a partial extent, and with varying success. Many of the natives, no doubt, during the progress of this exterminating war, saved themselves by flight and became, it is thought, the first colonists in Greece, Italy, and other countries. But a large portion made a stout resistance and retained possession of their old abodes in Canaan. In other cases, when the natives were vanquished, avarice led the Israelites to spare the idolaters, contrary to the express command of God; and their disobedience to His orders in this matter involved them in many troubles which this book describes.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which they possessed till Solomon’s time. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer,....

It remained Canaanite until conquered by Pharaoh Shishak, who gave it to his daughter, Solomon’s wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm" title="For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelled in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.">1 Kings 9:16</a>). Solomon rebuilt the city as a frontier fortress against the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1 Kings 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-17.htm" title="And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,">1 Kings 9:17</a>). It was an important place during the Maccabaean wars (Gazara, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-15.htm" title="Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword: for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto the plains of Idumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of them upon a three thousand men.">1Ma 4:15</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-52.htm" title="He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and the tower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals.">1Ma 9:52</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/14-34.htm" title="Moreover he fortified Joppa, which lieth upon the sea, and Gazera, that bordereth upon Azotus, where the enemies had dwelt before: but he placed Jews there, and furnished them with all things convenient for the reparation thereof.)">1Ma 14:34</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/15-28.htm" title="Furthermore he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends, to commune with him, and say, Ye withhold Joppa and Gazera; with the tower that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my realm.">1Ma 15:28</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/15-35.htm" title="And whereas thou demandest Joppa and Gazera, albeit they did great harm unto the people in our country, yet will we give thee an hundred talents for them.

Tell el-Jezer, a little S. of the Jaffa-Jerusalem road and 13 m. from Jerusalem, was recovered by Clermont-Ganneau in 1871. Several bilingual inscriptions in Hebr. and Gk. have been found near the Tell containing the words “boundary of Gezer [Hebr.]: of Alkios [Gk.],” supposed to refer to the sabbatic limits and the local governor who thus defined them. See Cl.-Ganneau, <span class="ital">Rec. d’arch. Orientale</span> iii. §§ 25, 47. The excavations recently conducted on the site have thrown much light on the past history of Canaan; seven strata of successive occupations have been ascertained; the area of the Canaanite temple or high place, much pottery, and, in the Israelite stratum, the bones of infants built into the foundations of houses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-34.htm" title="In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.">1 Kings 16:34</a>), and what has been identified as Solomon’s work of fortification, are among the most important discoveries; see <span class="ital">Palest.

The children of Joseph went up against Bethel, and Jehovah was with them, so that they were able to conquer the city. Bethel had indeed been assigned to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a>), but it was situated on the southern boundary of the tribe-land of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>); so that the tribe of Joseph could not tolerate the Canaanites in this border town, if it would defend its own territory against them, and purge it entirely of them. This is a sufficient explanation of the fact that this one conquest is mentioned, and this only, without there being any necessity to seek for the reason, as Bertheau does, in the circumstance that the town of Bethel came into such significant prominence in the later history of Israel, and attained the same importance in many respects in relation to the northern tribes, as that which Jerusalem attained in relation to the southern. For the fact that nothing more is said about the other conquests of the children of Joseph, may be explained simply enough on the supposition that they did not succeed in rooting out the Canaanites from the other fortified towns in their possessions; and therefore there was nothing to record about any further conquests, as the result of their hostilities was merely this, that they did not drive the Canaanites out of the towns named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>, but simply made them tributary. &#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, they had it explored, or spied out. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is construed with &#1489;&#1468; here, because the spying laid hold, as it were, of its object.
