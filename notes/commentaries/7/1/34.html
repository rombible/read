So far from reducing under tribute the Canaanites of its assigned possession, as the central tribes did, the Danites did not even succeed in establishing a tolerated neutrality among them, like the northern tribes, but were driven into a few mountain-strongholds. It was probably this failure, and the consequent pressure of space under which the tribe laboured, which induced them to undertake the successful northern expedition alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a> and described in Judges 18<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-34.htm" title="And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:...">Jdg 1:34-35</a></span>. <span class="ital">They would not suffer them to come down into the valley —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is, into the plain country; which was the occasion of that expedition for the obtaining of territory elsewhere, of which we read <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm" title="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.">Jdg 18:2</a>. <span class="ital">The hand of the house of Joseph prevailed — </span>That is, of the Ephraimites, who helped their brethren the Danites against the Amorites.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:21-36 The people of Israel were very careless of their duty and interest. Owing to slothfulness and cowardice, they would not be at the pains to complete their conquests. It was also owing to their covetousness: they were willing to let the Canaanites live among them, that they might make advantage of them. They had not the dread and detestation of idolatry they ought to have had. The same unbelief that kept their fathers forty years out of Canaan, kept them now out of the full possession of it. Distrust of the power and promise of God deprived them of advantages, and brought them into troubles. Thus many a believer who begins well is hindered. His graces languish, his lusts revive, Satan plies him with suitable temptations, the world recovers its hold; he brings guilt into his conscience, anguish into his heart, discredit on his character, and reproach on the gospel. Though he may have sharp rebukes, and be so recovered that he does not perish, yet he will have deeply to lament his folly through his remaining days; and upon his dying bed to mourn over the opportunities of glorifying God and serving the church he has lost. We can have no fellowship with the enemies of God within us or around us, but to our hurt; therefore our only wisdom is to maintain unceasing war against them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Amorites are usually found in the mountain <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6</a>.

The same course of subjugation was carried on in the other tribes to a partial extent, and with varying success. Many of the natives, no doubt, during the progress of this exterminating war, saved themselves by flight and became, it is thought, the first colonists in Greece, Italy, and other countries. But a large portion made a stout resistance and retained possession of their old abodes in Canaan. In other cases, when the natives were vanquished, avarice led the Israelites to spare the idolaters, contrary to the express command of God; and their disobedience to His orders in this matter involved them in many troubles which this book describes.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Into the plain country; which was the occasion of that expedition for the getting of new quarters; of which we read <span class="bld"> Jos 19 Jud 18</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain,....

At the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a> the LXX seem to have translated a text which commenced with ‘And the sons of Dan did not dispossess the Amorites …’ If this sentence stood originally in the present document, it would conform <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm" title="And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:">Jdg 1:34</a></span>, which begins abruptly, with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.">Jdg 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm" title="Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelled in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelled in Gezer among them.">Jdg 1:29</a></span> ff.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the Israelites grew strong, they made serfs of the Canaanites (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-15.htm">Genesis 49:15</a>).

For it by no means follows, from the appointment of a prefect by Solomon over the districts of Taanach, Megiddo, and Bethshean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>), that these districts had only been conquered by Solomon a short time before, when we bear in mind that Solomon appointed twelve such prefects over all Israel, to remit in regular order the national payments that were required for the maintenance of the regal court. Nor does it follow, that because Solomon employed the descendants of the Canaanites who were left in the land as tributary labourers in the erection of his great buildings, therefore he was the first who succeeded in compelling those Canaanites who were not exterminated when the land was conquered by Joshua, to pay tribute to the different tribes of Israel. </body></html>
