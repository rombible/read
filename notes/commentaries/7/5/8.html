The Syriac and Vulgate render it “God chose new things,” or “wars” (<span class= "ital">nova bella elegit Dominus, </span>Vulg.); but this gives a poorer sense, and is open to the objection that <span class= "ital">Jehovah, </span>not <span class= "ital">Elohim, </span>is used throughout the rest of the song. It alludes to the idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-11.htm" title="Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.">Jeremiah 2:11</a>) which brought the retribution described in the next clause. Ewald and his pupil, Bertheau, render “gods” (Elohim) by “judges;” but this is very doubtful, though the word has that meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-7.htm" title="If a man shall deliver to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.">Exodus 22:7-8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Then was war in the gates.</span>—The Canaanites drove the Israelites from the city gates, where judgments were given, and expelled them from their towns; so the Targum explains it to mean, “the storming of gates,” and so too Rabbi Tanchum. One MS. of the LXX. and the Syriac and Arabic versions have the strange rendering, “they chose new gods <span class= "ital">like barley bread,” </span>which Theodoret explains to mean, “as though after eating wheaten bread, men would voluntarily descend to coarse barley bread”; but this is only due to an inferior reading.<p><span class= "bld">Was there a shield or spear.</span>—This is usually, and not unnaturally, explained to mean that there had been a general disarmament (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm" title="And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.">Judges 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm" title="Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:">1Samuel 13:19</a>); we must then assume that the Israelites had only bows, slings, and swords. But (1) there is no indication whatever (but rather the reverse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-15.htm" title="And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.">Judges 4:15</a>) that Barak’s army—which, moreover, consisted of 10,000, not 40,000—was unarmed; and (2) the context seems to favour the meaning that, in spite of these degradations, there was not a warrior in all Israel who dared to put on his armour.<p><span class= "bld">Among forty thousand.</span>—Even if the number is meant as a round or general number, it is remarkable. It is true that though Barak only had 10,000 men with him, the contingents of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh are not counted; but even then the number shows that Israel was weakened and disunited, for the Transjordanic tribes alone had sent 40,000 men to help Joshua in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm" title="About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.">Joshua 4:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-8.htm" title="They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?">Jdg 5:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">They chose, </span>&c. — That is, the Israelites, after the death of Ehud, forsook the Lord, and served other gods. And they did not only submit to idolatry when they were forced to it by tyrants, but they freely chose it. <span class="ital">New gods — </span>New to them, and unknown to their fathers, and new in comparison of the true and everlasting God of Israel, being but of yesterday. <span class="ital">There was war in the gates — </span>That is, in their walled cities, which have gates and bars; <span class="ital">gates </span>are often put for <span class="ital">cities; </span>then their strong holds fell into the hands of their enemies. <span class="ital">Was there a shield? </span>&c. — There was not. The meaning is not, that all the Israelites were without arms; but, either they had but few arms among them, being many thousands of them disarmed by the Canaanites and Philistines, or that they generally neglected the use of arms, as being without all hope of recovering their liberty.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-11. Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny of Jabin, that their salvation might appear more gracious. She shows what brought this misery upon them. It was their idolatry. They chose new gods, with new names. But under all these images, Satan was worshipped. Deborah was a mother to Israel, by diligently promoting the salvation of their souls. She calls on those who shared the advantages of this great salvation, to offer up thanks to God for it. Let such as are restored, not only to their liberty as other Israelites, but to their rank, speak God's praises. This is the Lord's doing. In these acts of his, justice was executed on his enemies. In times of persecution, God's ordinances, the walls of salvation, whence the waters of life are drawn, are resorted to at the hazard of the lives of those who attend them. At all times Satan will endeavour to hinder the believer from drawing near to the throne of grace. Notice God's kindness to his trembling people. It is the glory of God to protect those who are most exposed, and to help the weakest. Let us notice the benefit we have from the public peace, the inhabitants of villages especially, and give God the praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "war in the gates" describes the hostile attacks of the Canaanites, which were the punishment of the idolatry of the Israelites (compare the marginal references), and the reduction of Israel to an unarmed and unresisting state under the Philistine dominion.

That is, Israel, as most of the Jewish commentators interpret it; for the verb is singular, and Israel agrees well with it: this they did after the death of Joshua; it refers to their first idolatry, begun by Micah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-1.htm">Judges 17:1</a> they chose other gods than the true God; Baalim and Ashtaroth they are said to serve, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>, and besides the gods of the Canaanites and Phoenicians, they sought after and introduced new ones from other places, or the same may be meant; since all besides the true God, the eternal Jehovah, the Ancient of days, and everlasting King, are new gods that lately sprung up: the Arabic and Syriac versions are,"God chose a new king;''so Ben Gersom; to perfect this wonder; for not only Sisera and his army were drawn to the gates of Israel to a proper place to fall in, but the victory was not obtained by Israel by their own force and strength; for they had no weapons of war, not a shield nor a spear, but for a very few men, but it was the Lord that fought for them in a new way; the former sense seems best, and agrees with what follows: <p>then was war in the gates; when they fell into idolatry, then God suffered the judgment of war to come upon them, even into the gates of their fortified cities, which were the security of them, and where were their courts of judicature, but by war disturbed and made to cease: <p>was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? though the number of the Israelites were several hundred thousands, yet there were not to be seen among them shields and spears sufficient for 40,000; or not one among 40,000 was armed; which was owing either to their negligence and sloth in not providing themselves with arms, or not taking care of them in a time of peace; so that when war came into their gates, they had nothing to defend themselves with, or annoy their enemies; or to their cowardice, not daring to take up a shield or spear in their own defence; or to the enemy, Jabin king of Canaan, having disarmed them, that they might not be able to make a revolt, from him, and recover their liberties. Ben Gersom refers it to the times of Joshua, when there was no need of a shield and spear among the 40,000 of the children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, that came over Jordan with them, since God fought for them; and the Targum seems to understand it of Sisera's army, that came against Israel with shields, spears, and swords; and makes the number of them to be in all 300,000, which is just the number of foot soldiers Josephus makes his army to consist of; and yet, though so numerous and so well armed, could not stand before Barak with 10,000 men only; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>, the words rather refer to the cival war of the Benjamites with the Israelites, when 40,000 of the latter were killed, which was before the times of Deborah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-21.htm">Judges 20:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They chose new gods; then <i>was</i> war in the gates: was there a <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?</span><p>(d) They had no heart to resist their enemies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>.

The first half of the verse yields no certain meaning. <span class="ital">They chose new gods</span>, lit. <span class="ital">it</span> (Israel) <span class="ital">chooses</span> etc., implies that Israel had been guilty of apostasy, and so was punished by an invasion; this is an idea quite foreign to the poem. Of the other renderings, <span class="ital">God chose new things</span>, nova bella elegit Dominus, Vulgate, is ungrammatical in Hebr. and open to the objection that <span class="ital">Jehovah</span>, not <span class="ital">Elohim</span>, is the Name in the poem; <span class="ital">he chooses new judges</span> (Ewald) is based upon an erroneous interpretation of Elohim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a> etc. <span class="ital">There was war in the gates</span> seems to point to some occasion (<span class="ital">then</span>) in the unsettled times before Deborah; in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm" title="They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.">Jdg 5:11</a></span> <span class="ital">the gates</span> are those of the enemy; but the word for <span class="ital">war</span> is wholly anomalous. Disregarding the vowels, the consonants might be translated <span class="ital">then there was barley bread</span>, similarly LXX. A, Lucian; but no good sense can be extracted from this. The corruption is too deep-seated for emendation; probably an early attempt was made to correct the passage from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm" title="They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Was there a shield or spear seen</span>] When the war broke out the able-bodied men in Israel had no proper weapons with which to meet the well-armed Canaanites; they were compelled to use such rude implements as they could find. <span class="bld">40,000</span> is a round number, not to be pressed; contrast the <span class="bld">301,000</span> men above twenty assigned in Numbers 26 (P) to the six tribes who here take part in the war.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The cause of this misery was not far to seek; it was the idolatry of the people which provoked God to anger.

According to the Septuagint rendering, and that of Theodot., &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, many give it the meaning to begin or to lead, and endeavour to establish this meaning from an Arabic word signifying to find one's self at the head of an affair. But this meaning cannot be established in Hebrew. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; has no other meaning than to let loose from something, to let a person loose or free (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>); and in the only other passage where &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-42.htm">Deuteronomy 32:42</a>), it does not refer to a leader, but to the luxuriant growth of the hair as the sign of great strength. Hence in this passage also &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; literally means comati, the hairy ones, i.e., those who possessed strength; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, to manifest or put forth strength. The persons referred to are the champions in the fight, who went before the nation with strength and bravery. The preposition &#1489;&#1468; before &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; indicates the reason for praising God, or rather the object with which the praise of the Lord was connected. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1506;, literally "in the showing themselves strong." The meaning is, "for the fact that the strong in Israel put forth strength." &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;, to prove one's self willing, here to go into the battle of their own free will, without any outward and authoritative command. This introduction transports us in the most striking manner into the time of the judges, when Israel had no king who could summon the nation to war, but everything depended upon the voluntary rising of the strong and the will of the nation at large. The manifestation of this strength and willingness Deborah praises as a gracious gift of the Lord. After this summons to praise the Lord, the first part of the song opens with an appeal to the kings and princes of the earth to hear what Deborah has to proclaim to the praise of God. </body></html>
