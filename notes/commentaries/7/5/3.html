No time should be lost in returning thanks to the Lord for his mercies; for our praises are most acceptable, pleasant, and profitable, when they flow from a full heart. By this, love and gratitude would be more excited and more deeply fixed in the hearts of believers; the events would be more known and longer remembered. Whatever Deborah, Barak, or the army had done, the Lord must have all the praise.

Not only the neighbouring ones, but all the kings and princes of the earth, far and near, then and in succeeding ages; Deborah desires and wishes that all potentates might hear of the wonderful works of God done for his people, that they might learn to know there is one that is higher than they, to whom all the amazing things done in the world are to be ascribed; and be cautious how they oppressed the people of God, since sooner or later he would avenge them on them. The Targum restrains this to the kings that came with Sisera and the governors with Jabin; but if there were any such, as it is not improbable there were, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>; yet it is most likely that they were slain with them: there are some, as Kimchi observes, who think this respects the people of Israel, who were all the sons of kings; but the first sense is best: <p>I, even I, will sing unto the Lord, I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel: which are the words of Deborah particularly, and the repetitions serve to express how cordial, earnest, and vehement she was in her praise and thankfulness to God; thereby setting an example to others, encouraging them to the same practice, and directing persons of every rank and quality to give praise only to Jehovah, the self-existing, everlasting, and unchangeable Being; to him who is the Lord and God of Israel in a peculiar manner, and not to any of the gods of the Gentiles. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

The word for <span class="ital">princes</span> thus occurs chiefly in the later literature, but it may have belonged to the elevated style in ancient poetry. <span class="bld">I, unto Yahweh I will sing</span>; there is a ring about the words in the original, and a strong emphasis on the pronoun. <span class="bld">I will make melody</span>, with voice and instruments, a word specially frequent in the Psalter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Her song was worthy to be listened to by kings and princes.

The anomaly apparent in the use of the gender may be accounted for on the ground that the masculine was the more general form, and might therefore be used for the more definite feminine. There are not sufficient grounds for altering it into &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;, the inf. abs. Whether Jael complied with this wish is not stated; but in the place of anything further, the chief fact alone is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>, namely, that Jael took a tent-plug, and went with a hammer in her hand to Sisera, who had fallen through exhaustion into a deep sleep, and drove the plug into his temples, so that it penetrated into the earth, or the floor. The words &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1470;&#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; are introduced as explanatory of the course of the events: "but he was fallen into a deep sleep, and exhausted," i.e., had fallen fast asleep through exhaustion. "And so he died." &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; is attached as a consequence to &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1504;&#1495; ... &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511;&#1506;, whereas &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507; belongs to the parenthetical clause &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;. This is the explanation adopted by Rosenmller, and also in the remark of Kimchi: "the words &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507; &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; indicate the reason why Sisera neither heard Jael approach him, nor was conscious of the blow inflicted upon him." For the combination of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507; with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, "then he became exhausted and died," which Stud. and Bertheau support, does not give any intelligible thought at all. A man who has a tent-peg driven with a hammer into his temples, so that the peg passes through his head into the ground, does not become exhausted before he dies, but dies instantaneously. And &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507;, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, equivalent to &#1506;&#1497;&#1507; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a>), or &#1497;&#1506;&#1507;, and written with Patach in the last syllable, to distinguish it from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, volare, has no other meaning than to be exhausted, in any of the passages in which it occurs (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-28.htm">1 Samuel 14:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-31.htm">1 Samuel 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-15.htm">2 Samuel 21:15</a>).
