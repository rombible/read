This work needs, and well deserves, the utmost liveliness and vigour of soul. Thus, having called upon all others, she now excites herself, with the most earnest and zealous affection, (expressed by the repetition of the same thing four times,) to celebrate the wonderful works of God. One cannot help observing the decorum which the prophetess observes in speaking of herself. Though she went along with Barak to levy his forces, accompanied him to the field of battle, and gave him the word of command when to charge the enemy, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/4-9.htm" title="And she said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh....">Jdg 4:9-14</a>,) yet, suitably to her sex and office, she only speaks of uttering a song of praise on the occasion, while she assigns to him, under God, the glory of the victory, and the honour of the triumph. <span class="ital">Arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive — </span>She calls on Barak to show his captives and spoils, that the Israelites might see how great reason they had for giving thanks to God. Some ask what captives he could have to lead when the whole army of Sisera was cut off? <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-16.htm" title="But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell on the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.">Jdg 4:16</a>. To which the answer is easy, that when Barak, after he had routed their army, pursued his victory as far as Harosheth, he doubtless took many prisoners, and probably not a few of the best quality, and brought them captive with him out of the country.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:12-23 Deborah called on her own soul to be in earnest. He that will set the hearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burn with love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awake ourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought for them, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinate enemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought for them. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour; for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employed must have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creation is at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned. Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace of God, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, and will fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side with Israel, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undue affection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfish spirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can but get, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little will serve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engage in needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them. But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and his enemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause in this wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers of iniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to accept the services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause. He requires every man to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deborah incites Barak to carry off as his prey the captive Canaanites and their sheep and cattle (their "captivity"). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-14. The wells which are at a little distance from towns in the East, are, in unsettled times, places of danger. But in peace they are scenes of pleasant and joyous resort. The poetess anticipates that this song may be sung, and the righteous acts of the Lord rehearsed at these now tranquil "places of drawing water." Deborah now rouses herself to describe, in terms suitable to the occasion, the preparation and the contest, and calls in a flight of poetic enthusiasm on Barak to parade his prisoners in triumphal procession. Then follows a eulogistic enumeration of the tribes which raised the commanded levy, or volunteered their services&#8212;the soldiers of Ephraim who dwelt near the mount of the Amalekites, the small quota of Benjamin; "the governors," valiant leaders "out of Machir," the western Manasseh; out of Zebulun.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Awake, awake; </span> stir up thyself and all that is within thee to admire and praise the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lead thy captivity captive:</span> how could this be done when there was none of them left? <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-16.htm" title="But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell on the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.">Judges 4:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answ</span>. 1.

Then she lashed her soul into action, and roused Barak from his lethargy by the promise of spoil and victory. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath,<p>In the days of Jael, the paths kept holiday, <p>And the wanderers of the paths went crooked ways.<p>  7  The towns in Israel kept holiday, they kept holiday,<p>Until that I, Deborah, arose, <p>That I arose a mother in Israel <p>  8  They chose new gods; <p>Then was war at the gates: <p>Was there a shield seen and a spear <p>Among forty thousand in Israel?<p>The deep degradation and disgrace into which Israel had sunk before the appearance of Deborah, through its falling away from the Lord into idolatry, forms the dark reverse of that glorification at Sinai. Although, after Ehud, Shamgar had also brought help to the people against their enemies by a victory over the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>), and although Jael, who proved herself a heroine by slaying the fugitive Sisera, was then alive, things had got to such a pitch with Israel, that no one would venture upon the public high roads. There are no good grounds for the conjecture that Jael was a different person from the Jael mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>., whether a judge who is not further known, as Ewald supposes, or a female judge who stood at the head of the nation in these unhappy times (Bertheau). &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, lit., "the paths ceased," sc., to be paths, or to be trodden by men. &#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;, "those who went upon paths," or beaten ways, i.e., those who were obliged to undertake journeys for the purpose of friendly intercourse or trade, notwithstanding the burden of foreign rule which pressed upon the land; such persons went by "twisted paths," i.e., by roads and circuitous routes which turned away from the high roads. And the &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., the cultivated land, with its open towns and villages, and with their inhabitants, was as forsaken and desolate as the public highways. The word perazon has been rendered judge or guidance by modern expositors, after the example of Teller and Gesenius; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a> decision or guidance. But this meaning, which has been adopted into all the more recent lexicons, has nothing really to support it, and does not even suit our verse, into which it would introduce the strange contradiction, that at the time when Shamgar and Jael were judges, there were no judges in Israel. In addition to the Septuagint version, which renders the word &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; in this verse (i.e., according to the Cod. Vat., for the Col. Al. has &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;), and then in the most unmeaning way adopts the rendering &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>, from which we may clearly see that the translators did not know the meaning of the word, it is common to adduce an Arabic word which signifies segregavit, discrevit rem ab aliis, though it is impossible to prove that the Arabic word ever had the meaning to judge or to lead. All the old translators, as well as the Rabbins, have based their rendering of the word upon &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;, inhabitant of the flat country (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>), and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514;, the open flat country, as distinguished from the towns surrounded by walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>), according to which &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;, as the place of meeting, would denote both the cultivated land with its unenclosed towns and villages, and also the population that was settled in the open country in unfortified places-a meaning which also lies at the foundation of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>. Accordingly, Luther has rendered the word Bauern (peasants). &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491; for &#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1491;. The contraction of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; into &#1513;&#1473;, with Dagesh following, and generally pointed with Seghol, but here with Patach on account of the &#1511;, which is closely related to the gutturals, belongs to the popular character of the song, and is therefore also found in the Song of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-12.htm">Judges 1:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-7.htm">Judges 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>). It is also met with here and there in simple prose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>); but it was only in the literature of the time of the captivity and a still later date, that it found its way more and more from the language of ordinary conversation into that of the Scriptures. Deborah describes herself as "a mother in Israel," on account of her having watched over her people with maternal care, just as Job calls himself a father to the poor who had been supported by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-16.htm">Job 29:16</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21</a>). </body></html>
