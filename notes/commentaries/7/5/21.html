The Chaldee paraphrases it, “the torrent on whose banks illustrious deeds have been done from the ancient times of Israel.” As the Plain of Jezreel has been in all ages the battle-field of Israel, the Kishon must always have played an important part in these struggles, as when the Turks were drowned in its swollen waves on April 16th, 1799. We know, however, of no ancient fame of Kishon before these events; and some render it. “the torrent of meeting armies,” or “of slaughters” (Ewald), deriving <span class= "ital">Kedumim </span>from an Arabic root; or “the torrent of succours,” connecting the word with <span class= "ital">Kiddeem </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm" title="O remember not against us former iniquities: let your tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.">Psalm 79:8</a>, &c., Heb.).

He that will set the hearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burn with love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awake ourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought for them, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinate enemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought for them. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour; for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employed must have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creation is at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned. Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace of God, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, and will fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side with Israel, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undue affection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfish spirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can but get, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little will serve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engage in needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them. But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and his enemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause in this wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers of iniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to accept the services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause. He requires every man to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word translated ancient occurs only here.

To which Sisera's army was drawn, and where it was discomfited; and very probably many of them, in their confusion, endeavoured to make their escape by fording or swimming over the river, by which they were swept away and drowned, the waters of it at this time swelling in a miraculous manner, as Ben Gersom thinks; or were increased by the large showers of rain that fell, as some note from Josephus, though I find it not in him; however it is not improbable it might be the case; for our countryman Mr. Maundrell (l) thus observed when he was at it;"in the condition we saw it, its waters were low and inconsiderable; but passing along the side of the plain, we discovered the track of many lesser torrents falling down into it from the mountains, which must needs make it swell exceedingly upon sudden rains, as doubtless it actually did at the destruction of Sisera's host, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>" <p>that ancient river, the river Kishon; called ancient, either because it was from the beginning of the creation, and not cut by the art of men, as some rivers are; or because it was spoken of by poets and historians in ancient times; or because of famous exploits done here of old; so the Targum,"the river where signs and mighty works were done for Israel of old.''Some take the word Kedumim to be another name of the river, so called from its windings and turnings, and, as it were, meeting itself. So some travellers tell us (m) the river Kedumim, the same with Kishon, is so called, because it meets itself, being by its meanders formed like a sling or noose, as Kishon signifies; it rises at Mount Tabor, and discharges itself into the Mediterranean sea, at the foot of Mount Carmel; so Hillerus (n) says, Kishon signifies bending in manner of a snare, or net, or meander, and takes it to be the same with the Pagida of Pliny (o), which in the Greek tongue signifies the same: <p>O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength; a strong and mighty army, through her prayers and supplication, advice and direction; or thou hast trodden with strength, that is, the river Kishon, as some Jewish interpreters understand it, who suppose that another miracle was wrought; that as the waters of the river swelled when the Canaanites attempted to escape over it, so it sunk and became fordable for Deborah and the Israelites; a miracle, as they suppose, somewhat similar to that at the Red sea. <p>(l) Journey from Aleppo, &amp;c. p. 57.

The fate of Sisera’s host finds a parallel in the battle of Mt Tabor between the army of Napoleon and the Turks, Apr. 16, 1799, when many of the latter were drowned when attempting to escape across a part of the plain inundated by the Kishon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">That ancient river</span>] lit. <span class="ital">torrent of antiquity</span>, so LXX.

The reading &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; (stat. constr.), adopted by the old versions, must be taken as the correct one, and the introduction of the preposition &#1489;&#1468; does not preclude this (compare &#1489;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;,   <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>, and Ewald, 289, b.). &#1506;&#1501;, which is used to denote an outward equality, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>, and is substantially the same as the &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; which follows ("just as"), is construed without &#1499;&#1468; in the first clause, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;: into the valley of Jezreel, the plain of Kishon. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8</a>, to be sent off, i.e., incessantly impelled, through his feet; here it is applied to an irresistible force of enthusiasm for the battle.

The enumeration of the tribes who remained at a distance from the conflict commences with Reuben (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16</a>). In this tribe there did arise a lively sympathy with the national elevation. They held meetings, passed great resolutions, but it led to no practical result; and at length they preferred to remain quietly at home in their own comfortable pastoral life. The meaning brooks for &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is well established by <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm">Job 20:17</a>, and there is no reason whatever for explaining the word as equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, divisions (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-5.htm">2 Chronicles 35:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-12.htm">2 Chronicles 35:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-18.htm">Ezra 6:18</a>). The territory of Reuben, which was celebrated for its splendid pastures, must have abounded in brooks. The question, Why satest thou, or remainedst thou sitting between the hurdles? i.e., in the comfortable repose of a shepherd's life, is an utterance of amazement; and the irony is very apparent in the next clause, to hear the bleating of the flocks, i.e., the piping of the shepherds, instead of the blast of the war-trumpets. </body></html>
