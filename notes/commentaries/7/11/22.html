Receive it from him, use it for him, and part with it when he calls for it. The whole of this message shows that Jephthah was well acquainted with the books of Moses. His argument was clear, and his demand reasonable. Those who possess the most courageous faith, will be the most disposed for peace, and the readiest to make advances to obtain; but rapacity and ambition often cloak their designs under a plea of equity, and render peaceful endeavours of no avail.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The title "God of Israel" has a special emphasis here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-23.htm">Judges 11:23</a>. in a narrative of transactions relating to the pagan and their gods.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the king of Ammon &#8230;, Because Israel took away my land&#8212;(See on [221]De 2:19). The subject of quarrel was a claim of right advanced by the Ammonite monarch to the lands which the Israelites were occupying. Jephthah's reply was clear, decisive, and unanswerable;&#8212;first, those lands were not in the possession of the Ammonites when his countrymen got them, and that they had been acquired by right of conquest from the Amorites [Jud 11:21]; secondly, the Israelites had now, by a lapse of three hundred years of undisputed possession, established a prescriptive right to the occupation [Jud 11:22, 23]; and thirdly, having received a grant of them from the Lord, his people were entitled to maintain their right on the same principle that guided the Ammonites in receiving, from their god Chemosh, the territory they now occupied [Jud 11:24]. This diplomatic statement, so admirable for the clearness and force of its arguments, concluded with a solemn appeal to God to maintain, by the issue of events, the cause of right and justice [Jud 11:27].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The coasts, </span> or <span class="ital">borders</span>, together with all the land included within those borders; for so that word is oft used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-2.htm" title="And if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your borders with frogs:">Exodus 8:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-14.htm" title="He makes peace in your borders, and fills you with the finest of the wheat.">Psalm 147:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-13.htm" title="Your substance and your treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.">Jeremiah 15:13</a> 17:3</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The wilderness, </span> to wit, the desert of Arabia. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites,....

They then sent messengers to the king of Edom, to obtain permission to pass through his land; and this the king of Edom refused (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>). They also sent to the king of Moab, who sent back a similar refusal. The embassy to the king of Moab is not mentioned in the Pentateuch, as it had no direct bearing upon the further course of the Israelites (see Pentateuch, p. 741, note 1). "And Israel abode in Kadesh" (word for word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>), and "then passed through the desert," namely to Mount Hor, then down the Arabah to the Red Sea, and still farther past Oboth to Ijje-abarim in the desert (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22-21:11</a>). In this way they went round the land of Edom and the land of Moab (&#1497;&#1505;&#1489;, like &#1505;&#1489;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>); and came from the east to the land of Moab (i.e., along the eastern boundary, for Ijje-abarim was situated there, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-11.htm">Numbers 21:11</a>); and encamped on the other side of the Arnon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>), i.e., on the upper course of the Arnon where it still flows through the desert (see Pent. p. 749). On this march, therefore, they did not enter the territory of Moab, as the Arnon formed the boundary of Moab, i.e., the boundary between Moab and the territory of the Amorites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>).</body></html>
