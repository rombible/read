The word may, however, be used in the harsh sense of the brethren of Jephthah, without being strictly accurate.

That Gilead is a proper name, not the name of the country mythically personified, may be regarded as certain. But is this Gilead the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, or some later Gilead? or does <span class= "ital">“</span>begat” mean “was the ancestor of?” The answer to these questions depends mainly upon the insoluble problem of the chronology; but we may note (1) that since no <span class= "ital">other </span>Gilead is mentioned, we should naturally infer that <span class= "ital">this </span>is the grandson of Manasseh; and (2) that the fact referred to in the obscure genealogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/7-14.htm" title="The sons of Manasseh; Ashriel, whom she bore: (but his concubine the Aramitess bore Machir the father of Gilead:">1Chronicles 7:14-17</a> seems to show that the family of Manasseh had Syrian (Aramean) connections, and Jephthah’s mother may have been an Aramitess from the district of Tob.

God had forgiven Israel, therefore Jephthah will forgive. He speaks not with confidence of his success, knowing how justly God might suffer the Ammonites to prevail for the further punishment of Israel. Nor does he speak with any confidence at all in himself. If he succeed, it is the Lord delivers them into his hand; he thereby reminds his countrymen to look up to God as the Giver of victory. The same question as here, in fact, is put to those who desire salvation by Christ. If he save you, will ye be willing that he shall rule you? On no other terms will he save you. If he make you happy, shall he make you holy? If he be your helper, shall he be your Head? Jephthah, to obtain a little worldly honour, was willing to expose his life: shall we be discouraged in our Christian warfare by the difficulties we may meet with, when Christ has promised a crown of life to him that overcometh?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The history of Jephthah appears to be an independent history inserted by the compiler of the Book of Judges.

Jephthah, the son of Gilead by a strange woman, fled, after his father's death, to the land of Tob <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a>, presumably the land of his maternal ancestors (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1</a>) and an "Aramean" settlement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-8.htm">2 Samuel 10:8</a>; 1 Macc. 5:13). It is difficult to conceive that Jephthah was literally the son of Gilead, if Gilead was the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh. Possibly "Gilead" here denotes the heir of Gilead, the head of the family, whose individual name has not been preserved, nor the time when he lived. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 11<p>Jud 11:1-3.

Jephthah had his name of Gileadite either from his father, whose name was Gilead, or from the city and country in which he was born, which is most likely, and so was of the same country with the preceding judge; and he was a man of great strength and valour, and which perhaps became known by his successful excursions on parties of the enemies of Israel, the Ammonites, being at the head of a band of men, who lived by the booty they got from them: <p>and he was the son of an harlot; the Targum says, an innkeeper; and, according to Kimchi, she was a concubine, which some reckoned no better than an harlot, but such are not usually called so; some Jewish writers will have her to be one of another tribe his father ought not to have married; and others, that she was of another nation, a Gentile, so Josephus (c): and, according to Patricides (d), he was the son of a Saracen woman; but neither of these are sufficient to denominate her a harlot: <p>and Gilead begat Jephthah; he was his son; this was a descendant of Gilead the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, called after the name of his great ancestor. <p>(c) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 7. sect. 7.
