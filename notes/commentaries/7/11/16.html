Receive it from him, use it for him, and part with it when he calls for it. The whole of this message shows that Jephthah was well acquainted with the books of Moses. His argument was clear, and his demand reasonable. Those who possess the most courageous faith, will be the most disposed for peace, and the readiest to make advances to obtain; but rapacity and ambition often cloak their designs under a plea of equity, and render peaceful endeavours of no avail.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Consult the marginal references.

The subject of quarrel was a claim of right advanced by the Ammonite monarch to the lands which the Israelites were occupying. Jephthah's reply was clear, decisive, and unanswerable;&#8212;first, those lands were not in the possession of the Ammonites when his countrymen got them, and that they had been acquired by right of conquest from the Amorites [Jud 11:21]; secondly, the Israelites had now, by a lapse of three hundred years of undisputed possession, established a prescriptive right to the occupation [Jud 11:22, 23]; and thirdly, having received a grant of them from the Lord, his people were entitled to maintain their right on the same principle that guided the Ammonites in receiving, from their god Chemosh, the territory they now occupied [Jud 11:24]. This diplomatic statement, so admirable for the clearness and force of its arguments, concluded with a solemn appeal to God to maintain, by the issue of events, the cause of right and justice [Jud 11:27].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto the Red Sea; </span> unto which they came three times; once, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm" title="But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 13:18</a></span>; again, a little after their passage over it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm" title="So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.">Exodus 15:22</a></span>; and a third time, long after, when they came to Ezion-gaber, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-35.htm" title="And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.">Numbers 33:35</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm" title="And when we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.">Deu 2:8</a></span>, which was upon the shore of the Red Sea, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm" title="And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.">1 Kings 9:26</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-17.htm" title="Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.">2 Chronicles 8:17</a></span>, from whence they went to Kadesh, <span class="bld"> Num 20</span>: of this time he speaks here. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But when Israel came up from Egypt,....
