Receive it from him, use it for him, and part with it when he calls for it. The whole of this message shows that Jephthah was well acquainted with the books of Moses. His argument was clear, and his demand reasonable. Those who possess the most courageous faith, will be the most disposed for peace, and the readiest to make advances to obtain; but rapacity and ambition often cloak their designs under a plea of equity, and render peaceful endeavours of no avail.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh - This phrase designates the presence of the tabernacle, or the ark, or of the high priest with Urim and Thummim <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-2.htm">Judges 21:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-7.htm">1 Samuel 21:7</a>.

His Embassy to the King of Ammon.<p>12-28. Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon&#8212;This first act in his judicial capacity reflects the highest credit on his character for prudence and moderation, justice and humanity. The bravest officers have always been averse to war; so Jephthah, whose courage was indisputable, resolved not only to make it clearly appear that hostilities were forced upon him, but to try measures for avoiding, if possible, an appeal to arms: and in pursuing such a course he was acting as became a leader in Israel (De 20:10-18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Messengers, </span> i.e. ambassadors, to prevent bloodshed, and make peace, as far as in him lay; that so the Israelites might be acquitted before God and men from all the sad consequences of this war: herein he showed great prudence, and no less piety. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">What hast thou to do with me?</span> what pretence or reasonable cause hast thou for this invasion? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My land; </span> he speaks this in the name of all the people, whose the land was. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon,....
