The word for “locks”—<span class= "ital">machelephoth</span>—occurs here only. The LXX. render it “curls<span class= "ital">” </span>(<span class= "ital">bostruchous</span>) and <span class= "ital">seiras, </span>which appears to mean “plaits,” like the Greek <span class= "ital">plokamous. </span>The word for “web” is a technical word, and perhaps means warp. The LXX. and the Vulg. add, “and drive them with the peg into the wall,” which is implied in the next verse. With almost incredible levity and folly, Samson here goes to the very verge of the true secret, and suffers his sacred hair to be woven in a harlot’s loom.

Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls.

If thou weavest the seven locks of my head&#8212;braids or tresses, into which, like many in the East, he chose to plait his hair. Working at the loom was a female employment; and Delilah's appears to have been close at hand. It was of a very simple construction; the woof was driven into the warp, not by a reed, but by a wooden spatula. The extremity of the web was fastened to a pin or stake fixed in the wall or ground; and while Delilah sat squatting at her loom, Samson lay stretched on the floor, with his head reclining on her lap&#8212;a position very common in the East.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">thread</span> which is woven about a weaver’s loom; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">with a weaver’s beam.</span> If my hair, which is all divided into seven locks, be fastened about a weaver’s beam, or interwoven with weavers’ threads; understand out of the foregoing verses, then I shall be weak as another man. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Delilah said unto Samson,.... At another time, when she thought it most proper to upbraid him with his deception of her: <p>hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies; both the times that she had solicited him to impart the secret of his strength to her: <p>tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound; tell me the real truth, and deceive me no more: <p>and he said unto her, if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web; it seems that Samson's hair was parted into seven locks, which no doubt hung down very long; and now he tells her, that if these were interwoven with the warp which was upon the beam in a loom near by; perhaps in the same room, where Delilah used to weave, as was the custom of those times, and in various nations (a); his strength would be weakened; for Braunius (b) is mistaken in supposing this to be the beam about which the web was rolled, as he is also in the pin next mentioned, which he takes to be the "spatha", or lathe, with which the threads are knocked together. <p>(a) "Arguto conjux", &amp;c.

Weaving was the work of women as well as of men; see the illustration from the Egyptian tombs at Beni Hasan dating from the Middle Kingdom, Benzinger, <span class="ital">Hebr. Archäol.</span>2, p. 151; Delîlah has a loom in her house. This was a horizontal loom fastened into the ground, as in the illustration referred to1[56]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] It looks as if it were upright; but this is due to the absence of perspective in Egyptian drawing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>; hence it would be easy to weave the hair of a person lying asleep upon the floor into <span class="ital">the warp</span>, i.e. the horizontal threads which are intersected at right angles by the weft, in this case Samson’s hair. To form the web, i.e. the woven cloth, a further operation is necessary, the beating up of the weft with a flat rod or batten, here rendered <span class="ital">pin</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-14.htm" title="And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines be on you, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.">Jdg 16:14</a></span>); the word usually means <span class="ital">peg</span>, esp. a tent-peg (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm" title="She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.">Jdg 5:26</a> mg.), but that it could also be used of a flat stick appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-13.htm" title="And you shall have a paddle on your weapon; and it shall be, when you will ease yourself abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you:">Deuteronomy 23:13</a> (<span class="ital">paddle</span> or <span class="ital">spade</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sentences needed to complete <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-13.htm" title="And Delilah said to Samson, Till now you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with which you might be bound.

With the help of the Greek versions the gap may be filled thus: “If thou weavest the seven plaits of my head with the warp, <span class="ital">and beatest them up with the batten, then shall I become weak and be as any other man. So she made him sleep, and wove the seven plaits of his head with the warp</span>, and beat them up with the batten.” It will be noticed that the existing text and the restored text both end in the same way. The eye of the copyist passed from the first <span class="ital">with the warp</span> to the second, and overlooked the intervening lines: a good instance of the source of textual mistakes known as homoioteleuton. The <span class="ital">seven</span> locks may have something to do with solar mythology. The Babyl. Gilgămesh had seven locks; in later Greek art Helios is usually represented with the same number.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seven locks</span>, by which we learn that his mass of hair as a Nazarite was arranged in seven locks or plaits.

This must mean the <span class="accented">warp</span>, which was already fastened in the loom, and across which Samson s locks were to be woven as the woof. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Allured by the reward in prospect, Delilah now sought to get from him the secret of his strength.

He first of all said to her (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-7.htm">Judges 16:7</a>), "If they bound me with strings that have not been dried, I should be weak and like one of the men" (i.e., like any other man). &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; signifies a sinew or string, e.g., a bow-string, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>, and in the different dialects either a bow-string or the string of a harp or guitar. As a distinction is made here between the &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and the &#1506;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-11.htm">Judges 16:11</a>, the strings intended here are those of catgut or animal sinew. The number seven is that of a divine act, answering to the divine power which Samson possessed.</body></html>
