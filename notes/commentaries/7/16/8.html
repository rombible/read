Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls. The anguish of the suffering is ten thousand times greater than all the pleasures of the sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the lords of the Philistines - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a> note.<p>His great strength lieth - Rather, "wherein his strength is great."<p>Eleven hundred pieces of silver - The greatness of the bribe offered to Delilah, 5,500 shekels of silver, nearly two talents (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>, note), shows the importance attached to Samson's capture. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. she bound him with them&#8212;probably in a sportive manner, to try whether he was jesting or in earnest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her,....

For this construction, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-22.htm">1 Samuel 1:22</a>. The verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;, "it was told" (according to the lxx and Chald.: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>), or &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "they said," is wanting before &#1500;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, and must have fallen out through a copyist's error. The verb &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; has evidently the subordinate idea of giving themselves up to careless repose; for if the watchmen who were posted at the city gate had but watched in a regular manner, Samson could not have lifted out the closed gates and carried them away. But as they supposed that he would not leave the harlot before daybreak, they relied upon the fact that the gate was shut, and probably feel asleep.</body></html>
