Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls. The anguish of the suffering is ten thousand times greater than all the pleasures of the sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Occupied - The margin, "wherewith work hath not been done," is better. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. new ropes&#8212;It is not said of what material they were formed; but from their being dried, it is probable they were of twigs, like the former.
