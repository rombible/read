But Samson, when he awoke, tore up the pin from its socket, and went away with the loom and the pin fastened to his hair.<p>The beam - Rather, the "loom," or "frame." The beam is the wooden revolving cylinder, on which the cloth is rolled as fast as it is woven, the Hebrew word for which <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-23.htm">1 Chronicles 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> is quite different from that here used. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web&#8212;that is, the whole weaving apparatus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having done what Samson directed, she adds this for sureness’ sake; she fastened the hair thus woven with a pin. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she fastened it with the pin,.... That is, after she had interwoven the locks of his hair into the warp, she fastened the beam on which it was with the pin, that it might not roll back; or else her machine or loom to the ground, that it might stand more firmly; or the web into which the hair was woven, with the hair itself; which of them is right, it is difficult to say: but if the addition of the Septuagint version can be admitted as genuine, which supplies some things which seem to be wanting, and which best agrees with what follows, the whole will be plain and easy, and which after the preceding verse runs thus;"and fastenest "them" with a pin to the wall, then shall I be weak as another man; and it came to pass when he slept, and Delilah took seven locks of his head, and wove "them" in the web, and fastened them with a pin to the wall;''and then it follows as here: <p>and said unto him, the Philistines be upon thee, Samson; as she had twice before: <p>and he awaked out of his sleep; in which he was during her weaving his locks into the web; and this makes it probable that he was in the same circumstances when she bound him both with withs and ropes, though it is not expressed: <p>and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web; carried off not the pin of the beam only, but the beam itself, and the warp on it, and the whole web into which his hair was woven. The Septuagint version is, he took the pin of the web out of the wall; and the Vulgate Latin, the pin with the hairs and web. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.

See the art. ‘Weaving’ by Prof. A. R. S. Kennedy in the <span class="ital">Encycl. Bibl</span>., upon which the foregoing notes are based.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she fastened it with the pin</span>. The Septuagint and many commentators understand that she used the pin (it is the common word for a tent pin) to fasten the loom or frame to the ground, or to the wall. But a good sense comes out if we understand the phrase to mean, <span class="accented">So she struck with the shuttle</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she did what Samson told her to do, viz., wove his locks into the warp which was already prepared. This was done by successive strokes of the shuttle, to which the hair was fastened. <span class="accented">To strike with the peg or shuttle</span> may have been the technical phrase for throwing the shuttle with the woof into the warp; and it is a strong argument in favour of this interpretation that it makes her action the simple fulfilment of his directions. He said, "Weave my locks into the warp. So she struck with the shuttle." <span class="cmt_word">With the pin of the beam, and with the web</span>. The Hebrew word '<span class="accented">ereg</span> cannot mean <span class="accented">the beam</span>, as it is here translated; it is the substantive of the verb <span class="accented">to weave</span> in ver. 13. Its obvious meaning, therefore, is <span class="accented">the woof.</span> The pin of the woof, therefore, is the shuttle with the woof attached to it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Samson's hair, which was firmly woven into the <span class="accented">warp.</span> He went away with. This is the same word as was applied in ver. 3 to his <span class="accented">plucking up</span> the gateposts. Now, with the strength of his neck, he tore up the shuttle which fastened his hair to the warp, and so dragged the whole solid frame along with it. However, as we do not know the technical term of the art of the weaving among the Hebrews and Philistines, nor the precise construction of their looms, some obscurity necessarily attaches to this description. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Delilah told this to the princes of the Philistines, they brought the seven strings required, and Delilah bound Samson with them. "And the spy sat in the room (&#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, dat. com., lit. 'to her,' i.e.) to help her." namely, without Samson knowing it, as Delilah had certainly not told him that she should betray the secret of his strength to the Philistines. He was there, no doubt, that he might be at hand and overpower the fettered giant as soon as it became apparent that his strength was gone. She then cried out to him, "Philistines upon thee, Samson!" And he snapped the strings as one would snap a cord in two "when it smells fire," i.e., is held to the fire.</body></html>
