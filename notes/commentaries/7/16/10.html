Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls. The anguish of the suffering is ten thousand times greater than all the pleasures of the sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the lords of the Philistines - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a> note.<p>His great strength lieth - Rather, "wherein his strength is great."<p>Eleven hundred pieces of silver - The greatness of the bribe offered to Delilah, 5,500 shekels of silver, nearly two talents (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>, note), shows the importance attached to Samson's capture. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

After this successful act, Samson gave himself up once more to his sensual lusts. He fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, named Delilah (i.e., the weak or pining one), to whose snares he eventually succumbed. With reference to the valley of Sorek, Eusebius affirms in the Onom. (s. v. &#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7;), that there was a village called &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7; (l. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7; according to Jerome) near Zorea, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (l. &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; according to Jerome, who has ad septentrionalem plagam); and also (s. v. &#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;) that this place was near to Eshtaol. Consequently the Sorek valley would have to be sought for somewhere in the neighbourhood of Samson's birthplace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>), and the dwelling-place of his family (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-31.htm">Judges 16:31</a>).</body></html>
