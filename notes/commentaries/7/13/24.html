St. Jerome, rendering it “strength of the sun,” derives it from <span class= "ital">shemesh, “</span>sun,” and <span class= "ital">on, “</span>strength.” It is more probable that it means “sunny.” In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm" title="Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:">Ezra 4:8</a> we have the name Shimshai, perhaps from the same root.

The mother gave the name in this instance. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/29-32.htm" title="And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked on my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.">Genesis 29:32-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.">Genesis 35:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-60.htm" title="And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.">Luke 1:60</a>.)

After these appearances were over, Manoah and his wife returned to their habitation, and she soon became pregnant, and at the usual course of time brought forth a son, and she gave him the name of Samson; for what reason it is not easy to determine. Josephus says (s) the word signifies "strong"; perhaps he was born a strong robust child, which is not unlikely, or the woman might have some prophetic hint of his future strength, and so gave him this name; but the word has not the signification of strength in it; it rather signifies the sun, which is indeed a strong body, and is compared to a strong man running his race, and so a strong man may be compared to that; but rather, with respect to the sun, this name might be given him, because of the splendour of his countenance with which he might be born, or in memory of the shining countenance of the angel which brought the tidings of his birth, or because he was to be the instrument of dispelling the darkness of calamity and distress Israel were now in: but the word more properly signifies a minister or servant, from whence the sun has its name; for Samson was to be, and was, a minister and servant of God, and of his people Israel. There is an agreement between the type and the antitype in this name in either sense. Christ is the mighty God, and mighty Saviour, the sun of righteousness, the light of the world, and the deliverer of his people from darkness of calamity and distress; and who came not to be ministered unto, but to minister and perform the great service of redemption and salvation: <p>and the child grew in bodily strength and stature, and grew up to man's estate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>. <p>and the Lord blessed him; not only with extraordinary strength of body, but with great endowments of mind, with the Spirit and graces of the Spirit; with grace, and blessings of it, and with his gracious presence; with this compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm">Psalm 21:3</a>. <p>(s) Ut supra, (Antiqu. l. 5. c. 8.) sect. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">Samson</span>] The form implies that the word is either an adjective or a diminutive, ‘solar’ or ‘little sun,’ from <span class="ital">shemesh</span> = ‘sun.’ The Engl. <span class="ital">Samson</span>, based on the Gk. <span class="greekheb">Σαμψών</span>, is nearer the original pronunciation than the <span class="ital">Shimshôn</span> of the M.T. In Babylonian <span class="ital">Shamshânu</span> has recently been found as a proper name (Hilprecht-Clay, <span class="ital">Bab. Exp.</span> ix. 27. 70), and in Egyptian Shamshân occurs as the name of a town in S.W. Palestine on the list of places captured by Ramses II (b.c. 1292–1225). It cannot be without significance that less than 2 m. from Ṣar‘a, just across the valley, lies ‘Ain Shems, which preserves the name of the ancient Beth-shemesh (= ‘temple of the sun) or Ir-shemesh (= ‘city of the sun’), <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-9.htm" title="And see, if it goes up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.">1 Samuel 6:9</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm" title="And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:">Joshua 15:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm" title="And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,">Joshua 19:41</a> etc. No doubt the worship of the sun prevailed at one time in the neighbourhood of Samson’s traditional home; and such indications as these seem to imply that sun-worship was familiar to the Israelites of the district, if not actually practised by them, until the religion of Jehovah gained supremacy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">grew … blessed him</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-26.htm" title="And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.">1 Samuel 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-19.htm" title="And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.">1 Samuel 3:19</a>; St <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-80.htm" title="And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.">Luke 1:80</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Called his name Samson</span>. No doubt the name was significant of what the child should be (see note to ver. 17), but the etymology and meaning of the name are doubtful. Josephus ('Antiq.,' V. 8:4) says the name means "a strong one," but he does not say in what language, and it does not appear to have such a meaning in any Semitic dialect. It is commonly interpreted to mean <span class="accented">like the sun</span>, from <span class="accented">shemesh</span>, the common word for the sun; and so Jerome in his 'Onomasticon' expounds it as <span class="accented">the sun's strength</span>,' possibly with an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>. Others make it equal <span class="accented">shim-</span>shorn, from the Pilpel conjugation of <span class="accented">shamem</span>, <span class="accented">to devastate.</span> Another possible derivation is from the Chaldee <span class="accented">shemash</span>, <span class="accented">to minister</span>, specially in sacred things, a root from which the Nestorian, Syriac, and Arabic names for a deacon are derived. If this were the derivation, it would be a reference to his dedication to God as a Nazarite from his mother's womb, the only thing his mother knew about him when she gave him the name. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The angel replied, "Why askest thou then after my name? truly it is wonderful." The Kethibh &#1508;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497; is the adjectival form &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497; from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, for which the Keri has &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, the pausal form of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; (from the radical &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;). The word therefore is not the proper name of the angel of the Lord, but expresses the character of his name; and as the name simply denotes the nature, it expresses the peculiarity of his nature also. It is to be understood in an absolute sense, - "absolutely and supremely wonderful" (Seb. Schmidt), - as a predicate belonging to God alone (compare the term "Wonderful" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), and not to be toned down as it is by Bertheau, who explains it as signifying "neither easy to utter nor easy to comprehend." </body></html>
