In the cases of Jephthah and Samson the Israelites learnt the power which rests in individual vows to display the occult and mysterious heroism of the human spirit, and to save people from sinking into the lowest depths (Ewald, 2:397). The vow became a new force of the age. In Jephthah’s case it had been an isolated vow, but in Samson’s it was the devotion of a life, and developed an indomitable energy and power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm" title="For, see, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.">Jdg 13:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">The child shall be a Nazarite — </span>Consecrated to God’s service in a peculiar manner. <span class="ital">He shall begin to deliver Israel — </span>He did not complete the deliverance of the Israelites from the servile yoke of the Philistines; but the work was carried on and perfected by others, namely, by Eli, Samuel, and Saul, and especially by David.

When Israel was in this distress, Samson was born. His parents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were born of such mothers. Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and by them others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy. The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer of Israel must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that the messenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, both of the promise and of the precept. Husbands and wives should tell each other their experiences of communion with God, and their improvements in acquaintance with him, that they may help each other in the way that is holy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Nazarite - See the marginal reference. and note.

In this his antitype exceeds him, who is the author of the complete salvation of his people out of the hands of all their enemies, sin, Satan, and the world; though in this there is a great resemblance between Samson and our Lord Jesus, in that what he did he did himself alone; not at the head of an army, and with forces under him, as other judges; so Christ with his own arm, and of himself, and without others, wrought salvation for his people; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</span><p>(b) Meaning he should be separate from the world, and dedicated to God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">thou shalt conceive</span>] The present in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-11.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, you are with child and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Ishmael; because the LORD has heard your affliction.">Genesis 16:11</a> RV. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a> RVm.; the future is more suitable here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a Nazirite unto God</span>] lit. <span class="ital">one separated unto God</span>; this, the full term, came to be abbreviated <span class="ital">nâzîr</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">separated, devoted</span>, a <span class="ital">Nazirite</span>. It is to be noticed that (1) the consecration took effect from birth; it was not voluntary, but due to the call of God, in this respect resembling the case of the prophets, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-5.htm" title="Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb, which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and you, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.">Isaiah 44:2</a>; (2) it was life-long and not temporary; (3) the special sign of consecration was the unshorn hair, <span class="ital">no razor shall come upon his head</span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-17.htm" title="That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor on my head; for I have been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.">Jdg 16:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1 Samuel 1:11</a>; this seems to have been the one essential characteristic; and (4) the object or task of the person thus devoted was to wage war and effect a deliverance. The connexion between (3) and (4) is illustrated by the custom of Arab warriors to wear the hair long when they vowed inveterate war, probably too by the long hair of the chiefs in Deborah’s Song (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-2.htm" title="Praise you the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.">Jdg 5:2</a>). In old Israel the Nazirite was no doubt a familiar figure; but besides Samson, the only other and not quite certain example is Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), though he is not called a Nazirite till <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/46-13.htm" title="Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people.">Sir 46:13</a> (in the Hebr., not in the Gk. text), and in Talmudic tradition (<span class="ital">Nazir</span> 66 a ‘Samuel was a Nazirite according to the teaching of R. Naharaï’). There was nothing ascetic about a Nazirite in the early days, as the story of Samson proves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-10.htm" title="So his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.">Jdg 14:10</a>); abstinence from wine did not become a mark of this type of devotee till a later time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-12.htm" title="But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.">Amos 2:12</a>), and then probably as a protest against Canaanite habits (cf. the Rechabites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-9.htm" title="Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:">Jeremiah 35:9</a> ff.). What was probably a later development still appears in the detailed law of the Nazirite in Numbers 6; there abstinence from wine has become the principal feature; the hair is treated as a hair-offering; instead of preserving it unshorn, the Nazirite is to shave when the period of the vow is over; the vow itself is not life-long but temporary and voluntary; and contact with a dead body is strictly forbidden, a prohibition which cannot have existed in the early days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-19.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments to them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.">Jdg 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-8.htm" title="And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelled in the top of the rock Etam.">Jdg 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-15.htm" title="And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.">Jdg 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.">1 Samuel 15:33</a>). The obvious differences between Nazirites of Samson’s type and those of the type laid down in the law formed a topic of discussion among the Rabbis (Talmud B. <span class="ital">Nazir</span> 4 a, b). After the Exile temporary Nazirites were numerous down to the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-49.htm" title="They brought also the priests' garments, and the firstfruits, and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who had accomplished their days.">1Ma 3:49</a>; Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span> xix. 6, 1, <span class="ital">Wars</span> ii. 15, 1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-23.htm" title="Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men which have a vow on them;">Acts 21:23</a> ff.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The treatment of the hair, whether preserved unshorn or offered as a sacrifice, is based upon a widely spread and primitive belief that the hair is a part of a man’s self; if it is never shorn, his strength is undiminished, he is intact; if it is shorn and offered at the sanctuary, it is in a measure an offering of oneself1[51].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[51] See Gray, <span class="ital">Journ. of Theol.

The view of Samson’s history indicated by this remark shews that ch. 13 must be somewhat later than 14–16. It is doubtful whether <span class="ital">begin</span> implies that Samson was regarded as the forerunner of Samuel and Saul in the struggle against the Philistines (Wellhausen, <span class="ital">Composition d. Hex.</span>, p. 231; S. A. Cook, <span class="ital">Notes on O.T. Hist.</span>, p. 34); the word probably means no more than ‘shall be the first to,’ as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-18.htm" title="And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.">Jdg 10:18</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The child shall be a Nazarite</span>, etc. So it was said, though not in the same words, concerning Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) and concerning John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>). A Nazarite (or, more correctly, a <span class="accented">Nazi-rite</span>) means one <span class="accented">separated</span>, and specially dedicated to God. The law of the Nazarites is contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, where, however, only <span class="accented">Nazarites of days</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nazarites for a definite time, arc spoken cf. Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were <span class="accented">perpetual Nazarites</span>, Nazarites of <span class="accented">for ever</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the Mishna classifies them. Abstinence from strong drink, and from anything made of the grape; letting the locks of the head grow unchecked by the razor; and keeping quite clear of any pollution from a dead body, even in case of the death of his nearest relations, were the chief articles of a Nazarite's vow. St. Paul took the vow of a Nazarite of days, and offered the prescribed sacrifices, together with "the hair of the head of his separation," as we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23-26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall begin</span>, etc. This is an exact description of what Samson did. He did not "deliver Israel" as the other judges did; but he began to shake the Philistine power, and prepared the way for the deliverance of Israel in the time of his worthier successor Samuel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He was followed by the judge Abdon, the son of Hillel of Pirathon.
