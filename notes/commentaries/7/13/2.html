When Israel was in this distress, Samson was born. His parents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were born of such mothers. Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and by them others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy. The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer of Israel must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that the messenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, both of the promise and of the precept.

Zorah was an ancient Canaanite town, and is referred to in the Amarna Letters (173, 21) along with Aijalon. The name is preserved in the modern Ṣar‘a, 15 m. west of Jerusalem. The situation of the town just opposite Beth-shemesh (prob. = Mt Ḥeres <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm" title="But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.">Jdg 1:35</a>) exposed it to Philistine influences.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the family of the Danites … Manoah</span>] The Danites were a small tribe, hence ‘family’ is used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm" title="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.">Jdg 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm" title="And there went from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.">Jdg 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm" title="And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?">Jdg 18:19</a>, though ‘tribe’ also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-1.htm" title="In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day all their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.">Jdg 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm" title="And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?">Jdg 18:19</a>. Originally they attempted to settle in the southern lowland, but the Amorites forced them into the neighbouring hill country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm" title="And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:">Jdg 1:34</a> f.), a district which afterwards passed into the possession of Judah. From their southern settlements the Danites, probably owing to Canaanite or Philistine pressure, migrated to the north, and established themselves at Laish or Leshem-Dan, near the sources of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm" title="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.">Jdg 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm" title="And there went from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.">Jdg 18:11</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-27.htm" title="And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.">Jdg 18:27</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a>). The account of this migration, though given at the end of Judges, probably belongs to the period of ch. 1. The Danites were already settled in their northern home at the time of Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-17.htm" title="Gilead stayed beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and stayed in his breaches.">Jdg 5:17</a>). But ch. 18 does not say that the entire tribe migrated; some families remained behind in the south, as the present narrative implies. Manoaḥ must have been closely connected with the Manaḥathites of Zorah, a family which traced its origin to the Calebite clans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/2-52.htm" title="And Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons; Haroeh, and half of the Manahethites....">1 Chronicles 2:52-54</a>), and had affinities both with the Horites of Seir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-23.htm" title="And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.">Genesis 36:23</a> P) and with Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-1.htm" title="The sons of Judah; Pharez, Hezron, and Carmi, and Hur, and Shobal.">1 Chronicles 4:1</a>). This Horite family lived in Zorah and was absorbed into the mixed tribe of Dan: such seems to be the conclusion suggested by the genealogies. Manoaḥ thus becomes, the eponymous ancestor of the family which bore his name, and in popular tradition Samson was known as his ‘son,’ just as Jephthah is called the ‘son’ of Gilead in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-1.htm" title="Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.">Jdg 11:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">was barren, and bare not</span>] Cf.
