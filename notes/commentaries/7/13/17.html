God has in his word given full directions concerning our duty, but never designed to answer other questionings. There are secret things which belong not to us, of which we must be quite contented to be ignorant, while in this world. The name of our Lord is wonderful and secret; but by his wonderful works he makes himself known as far as is needful for us. Prayer is the ascent of the soul to God. But without Christ in the heart by faith, our services are offensive smoke; in him, acceptable flame. We may apply this to Christ's sacrifice of himself for us; he ascended in the flame of his own offering, for by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, Heb 9:12. In Manoah's reflections there is great fear; We shall surely die. In his wife's reflection there is great faith. As a help meet for him, she encouraged him. Let believers who have had communion with God in the word and prayer, to whom he has graciously manifested himself, and who have had reason to think God has accepted their works, take encouragement from thence in a cloudy and dark day. God would not have done what he has done for my soul, if he had designed to forsake me, and leave me to perish at last; for his work is perfect. Learn to reason as Manoah's wife; If God designed me to perish under his wrath, he would not give me tokens of his favour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do thee honor - If applied to a man, it would be by gifts, such for instance as Balak promised to the prophet Balaam <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17</a>, and such as were usually given to seers <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7-8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a> : if to God, it would be by sacrifices <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-20.

See note to ver. 6.

Manoah had certainly some suspicious as to the mysterious character of his visitor, and expected the name to reveal his true nature. <span class="cmt_word">We may do thee honour</span>. Manoah seems throughout to use ambiguous language, suitable either to a man, if he was speaking to a man, or to a celestial visitant, should he be angel or God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then she hastened to fetch her husband, who first of all inquired of the person who had appeared, "Art thou the man who said to the woman" (sc., what has been related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3-5</a>)?

The plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is construed ad sensum with the singular verb, because the words form one promise, so that the expression is not to be taken distributively, as Rosenmller supposes.
