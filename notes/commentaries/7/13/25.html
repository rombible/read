A temporary encampment outside the Danite district might naturally receive the name of <span class="ital">Dan’s Camp</span>, but not a place among the seats of the tribe. As it is unlikely that there were two places called <span class="ital">Dan’s Camp</span> in this part of the country, we must suppose that there is something wrong about the name here.

It is to be noticed that the grave of Manoah, the ancestor of the Manahathites, occupied exactly the position described in this verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-31.htm" title="Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial plot of Manoah his father.

Zorah is certainly Ṣar‘a; and Eshtaol may have stood on the site of Eshû‘ about 1½ m. to the N.E., up the valley which branches off northwards from the W. eṣ-Ṣarâr (Sorek). Both places overlook the broad basin of the W. eṣ-Ṣarâr near its entrance into the Judaean highlands.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord</span>, etc. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">To move him</span> - to urge and impel him to strange actions by fits and starts.

In what the miracle consisted is explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-20.htm">Judges 13:20</a>, in the words, "when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar;" that is to say, in the fact that a flame issued from the rock, as in the case of Gideon's sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>), and consumed the sacrifice. And the angel of the Lord ascended in this flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell upon their faces to the earth (sc., in worship), because they discovered from the miracle that it was the angel of the Lord who had appeared to them. </body></html>
