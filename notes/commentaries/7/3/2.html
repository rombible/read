The Lord was pleased to try them by the remains of the devoted nations they spared. Temptations and trials detect the wickedness of the hearts of sinners; and strengthen he graces of believers in their daily conflict with Satan, sin, and this evil world. They must live in this world, but they are not of it, and are forbidden to conform to it. This marks the difference between the followers of Christ and mere professors. The friendship of the world is more fatal than its enmity; the latter can only kill the body, but the former murders many precious souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even as many of Israel ... - These words show that the writer has especially in view the generation which came to man's estate immediately after the close of the wars with the Canaanites <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-1.htm">Joshua 23:1</a>.

Nations Left to Prove Israel.<p>1. these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel&#8212;This was the special design of these nations being left, and it evinces the direct influence of the theocracy under which the Israelites were placed. These nations were left for a double purpose: in the first instance, to be instrumental, by their inroads, in promoting the moral and spiritual discipline of the Israelites; and also to subserve the design of making them acquainted with war, in order that the young, more especially, who were total strangers to it, might learn the use of weapons and the art of wielding them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Might know, to teach them war; </span> that by the neighbourhood of such warlike potent enemies, they might be purged from sloth and security, and obliged to inure themselves to martial exercises, and to stand continually upon their guard, and consequently to keep close to that God whose assistance they had so great and constant need of. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know and teach them war,.... That is, the following nations were left in the land, that the young generations of Israel might by their wars and conflicts with them learn the art of war, and be inured to martial discipline; which, if none had been left to engage with, they had been ignorant of: besides, their fathers in Joshua's time, as Jarchi and Kimchi observe, had no need to learn the art of war, for God fought for them; they did not get possession of the land by their own arm, and by their sword, but by the power of God in a miraculous way; but now this was not to be expected, and the Canaanites were left among them to expel, that they might be trained up in the knowledge of warlike affairs, and so be also capable of teaching their children the military art; which they should make use of in obeying the command of God, by driving out the remains of the Canaanites, and not give themselves up to sloth and indolence; though some think that the meaning is, that God left these nations among them, that they might know what war was, and the sad effects of it; and the difference of fighting with their enemies alone, as other men, and the Lord fighting along with them, and for them, as he did for their fathers: <p>at least such as before knew nothing thereof; being either unborn, or at an age incapable of bearing arms, or learning the art of war. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> nothing thereof;</span><p>(b) For they trusted in God and he fought for them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">might know</span>] The verb, instead of governing a direct object, is followed by a fresh clause <span class="ital">to teach them war</span>; the LXX relieves the awkwardness by omitting <span class="ital">might know</span>, ‘only for the sake of the generations … to teach them war.’ The incompleteness of the conquest was not a punishment for Israel’s unfaithfulness to the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/2-20.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;...">Jdg 2:20-21</a>), nor a test of Israel’s steadfastness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-23.htm" title="Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.">Jdg 2:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/3-4.htm" title="And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses....">Jdg 3:4-6</a>), but a discipline1[24] designed to train Israel to hold its own and ascribe its victories to Jehovah’s help.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[24] Cf.
