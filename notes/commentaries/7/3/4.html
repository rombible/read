The Lord was pleased to try them by the remains of the devoted nations they spared. Temptations and trials detect the wickedness of the hearts of sinners; and strengthen he graces of believers in their daily conflict with Satan, sin, and this evil world. They must live in this world, but they are not of it, and are forbidden to conform to it. This marks the difference between the followers of Christ and mere professors. The friendship of the world is more fatal than its enmity; the latter can only kill the body, but the former murders many precious souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lords - Seranim, a title used exclusively of the princes of the five Philistine cities.

Nations Left to Prove Israel.<p>1. these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel&#8212;This was the special design of these nations being left, and it evinces the direct influence of the theocracy under which the Israelites were placed. These nations were left for a double purpose: in the first instance, to be instrumental, by their inroads, in promoting the moral and spiritual discipline of the Israelites; and also to subserve the design of making them acquainted with war, in order that the young, more especially, who were total strangers to it, might learn the use of weapons and the art of wielding them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To know, </span> i.e. that they and others might know by experience. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they were to prove Israel by them,....

On account of this idolatry, which was not only constantly repeated, but continued to grow worse and worse, the anger of the Lord burned so fiercely against Israel, that He determined to destroy no more of the nations which Joshua had left when he died, before the people that had broken His covenant. In order to set forth this divine purpose most distinctly, it is thrown into the form of a sentence uttered by God through the expression &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. The Lord said, "Because this people has transgressed my covenant, ...
