They render the same phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>, “spirit of courage from Jehovah.” This expression constantly recurs in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm" title="Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.">Judges 13:25</a>). For “came upon him” (literally “w<span class= "ital">as upon </span>him”), a stronger phrase is “clothed him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm" title="Then the spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Your are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.">1Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.">2Chronicles 24:20</a>). The Jews, however, placed Othniel highest among the judges, and applied to him the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-7.htm" title="You are all fair, my love; there is no spot in you.">Song of Solomon 4:7</a>, “Thou art all fair; there is no spot in thee,” because he alone of the judges is represented as irreproachable. Further than this, they followed some dim traditional data in identifying him with Jabez (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-10.htm" title="And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that you would bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that your hand might be with me, and that you would keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.">1Chronicles 4:10</a>), and regarding him as a learned teacher of the law. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Judges 1:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He judged Israel.</span>—Some of the Rabbis explain “judged” (<span class= "ital">yishhab</span>) here to mean “avenged,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-1.htm" title="Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.">Psalm 43:1</a>, “Avenge me, O God” (<span class= "ital">Shapetêni</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span>possibly from disliking the notion of a Kenizzite, however distinguished, holding the office of a <span class= "ital">suffes, </span>or judge. There is a difficulty about Othniel’s age; Caleb was eighty-five at the conquest, and, if Othniel was his brother, he could not have been less than fifty or sixty at that time. But even supposing him to have been Caleb’s nephew, and aged forty at his marriage, then, since Joshua lived to be 110, and Cushan-Rishathaim’s oppression did not begin till after the death of the elders who outlived Joshua, and lasted eight years, if Othniel was judge for forty years, this would make him quite 143 years old at his death. It is only another sign that the chronological data of the Book of Judges are not sufficiently definite to enable us to construct a system out of them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-11 The first judge was Othniel: even in Joshua's time Othniel began to be famous. Soon after Israel's settlement in Canaan their purity began to be corrupted, and their peace disturbed. But affliction makes those cry to God who before would scarcely speak to him. God returned in mercy to them for their deliverance. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel. The Spirit of wisdom and courage to qualify him for the service, and the Spirit of power to excite him to it. He first judged Israel, reproved and reformed them, and then went to war. Let sin at home be conquered, that worst of enemies, then enemies abroad will be more easily dealt with. Thus let Christ be our Judge and Lawgiver, then he will save us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him - The phrase occurs frequently in this book and in the books of Samuel and Kings.

These heroes seemed to be possessed; their extraordinary feats of strength and daring struck the beholder as due to the presence of a superhuman power—the spirit of the Lord, i.e. Jehovah directly acting in the physical, as elsewhere in the intellectual and spiritual, sphere. In the O.T. the spirit is not realized as a distinct personality; the spirit of Jehovah is Jehovah Himself in operation, and, as the divine name implies, in redemptive operation on behalf of Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he judged Israel</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-16.htm" title="Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.">Jdg 2:16</a>. The verb means both ‘to give judgement’ and ‘to do justice,’ ‘to give a person his rights’; in the latter sense it is used in parallelism with ‘save,’ and can even be followed by ‘out of the hand of,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm" title="The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.">1 Samuel 24:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-19.htm" title="Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.">2 Samuel 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-31.htm" title="And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD has avenged you this day of all them that rose up against you.">2 Samuel 18:31</a>. In the, age before the monarchy the ‘judges’ or ‘deliverers’ exercised in Israel an intermittent function, to which they were specially summoned by Jehovah; hence the Dtc. compiler uses the word almost as the title of an office. When the national sense was more fully developed, the Israelites demanded a king to fulfil the same function permanently instead of intermittently: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-20.htm" title="That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.">1 Samuel 8:20</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Spirit</span>, etc. This marks Othniel as one of the extraordinary <span class="accented">Shophetim</span>, or judges, Divinely commissioned to save Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6, 19</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The enumeration of the different nations rests upon <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2-6</a>, and, with its conciseness and brevity, is only fully intelligible through the light thrown upon it by that passage. The five princes of the Philistines are mentioned singly there. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-4.htm">Joshua 13:4</a>., "all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites," are the Canaanitish tribes dwelling in northern Canaan, by the Phoenician coast and upon Mount Lebanon. "The Canaanites:" viz., those who dwelt along the sea-coast to the south of Sidon. The Hivites: those who were settled more in the heart of the country, "from the mountains of Baal-hermon up to the territory of Hamath." Baal-hermon is only another name for Baal-gad, the present Banjas, under the Hermon (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>). When it is stated still further in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-4.htm">Judges 3:4</a>, that "they were left in existence (i.e., were not exterminated by Joshua) to prove Israel by them," we are struck with the fact, that besides the Philistines, only these northern Canaanites are mentioned; whereas, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a>, many towns in the centre of the land were also left in the hands of the Canaanites, and therefore here also the Canaanites were not yet exterminated, and became likewise a snare to the Israelites, not only according to the word of the angel of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>), but also because the Israelites who dwelt among these Canaanitish tribes contracted marriages with them, and served their gods. This striking circumstance cannot be set aside, as Bertheau supposes, by the simple remark, that "the two lists (that of the countries which the tribes of Israel did not conquer after Joshua's death in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a>, and the one given here of the nations which Joshua had not subjugated) must correspond on the whole," since the correspondence referred to really does not exist. It can only be explained on the ground that the Canaanites who were left in the different towns in the midst of the land, acquired all their power to maintain their stand against Israel from the simple fact that the Philistines on the south-west, and several whole tribes of Canaanites in the north, had been left by Joshua neither exterminated nor even conquered, inasmuch as they so crippled the power of the Israelites by wars and invasions of the Israelitish territory, that they were unable to exterminate those who remained in the different fortresses of their own possessions. Because, therefore, the power to resist the Israelites and oppress them for a time resided not so much in the Canaanites who were dwelling in the midst of Israel, as in the Philistines and the Canaanites upon the mountains of Lebanon who had been left unconquered by Joshua, these are the only tribes mentioned in this brief survey as the nations through which the Lord would prove His people.</body></html>
