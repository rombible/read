The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ehud "went down" from the mountain of Ephraim into the Jordan valley beneath it, straight to the Jordan fords <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>, so as to intercept all communication between the Moabites on the west side and their countrymen on the east. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. they went down after him, and took the fords&#8212;(See on [214]Jos 2:7).

The last words have been rendered in various ways. Luther follows the Chaldee and Vulgate, and renders it "so that the dirt passed from him," taking the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; as a composite noun from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, stercus, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1492;, jecit. But this is hardly correct, as the form of the word &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492;, and its connection with &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, rather points to a noun, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1503;, with &#1492; local. The explanation given by Gesenius in his Thes. and Heb. lex. has much more in its favour, viz., interstitium pedum, the place between the legs, from an Arabic word signifying pedes dissitos habuit, used as a euphemism for anus, podex. The subject to the verb is the blade.<p>(Note: At any rate the rendering suggested by Ewald, "Ehud went into the open air, or into the enclosure, the space in front of the Alija," is untenable, for the simple reason that it is perfectly irreconcilable with the next clause, "Ehud went forth," etc. (consequently Fr. Bttcher proposes to erase this clause from the text, without any critical authority whatever). For if Ehud were the subject to the verb, the subject would necessarily have been mentioned, as it really is in the next clause, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-23.htm">Judges 3:23</a>.) </body></html>
