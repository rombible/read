Some suppose that these images had been placed there by the Moabites, in contempt of the God of Israel, who had so long honoured Gilgal with his presence; and that they might ascribe the subjection of the land to their idols, as the Israelites gave the glory of their conquest to the true God. And they further suppose that when Ehud beheld these idolatrous images, he was inflamed with zeal and indignation, so that instead of proceeding any further in his return home, he went back with a full resolution to revenge the indignity offered to the Divine Majesty, as well as the oppression of his people. <span class="ital">Who said, Keep silence — </span>That is, forbear to speak till my servants are withdrawn.

The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon his right thigh - The proper side for a left-handed man.

First of all, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-14</a>, the subjugation. When the Israelites forsook the Lord again (in the place of &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1506; ... &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>, we have here the appropriate expression  ... &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, they added to do, i.e., did again, evil, etc., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>), the Lord made Eglon the king of the Moabites strong over Israel. &#1506;&#1500; &#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;, to give a person strength to overcome or oppress another. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a>, instead of the more usual &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>). Eglon allied himself with the Ammonites and Amalekites, those arch-foes of Israel, invaded the land, took the palm-city, i.e., Jericho (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), and made the Israelites tributary for eighteen years. Sixty years had passed since Jericho had been burnt by Joshua. During that time the Israelites had rebuilt the ruined city, but they had not fortified it, on account of the curse pronounced by Joshua upon any one who should restore it as a fortress; so that the Moabites could easily conquer it, and using it as a base, reduce the Israelites to servitude. </body></html>
