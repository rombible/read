The Lord was pleased to try them by the remains of the devoted nations they spared. Temptations and trials detect the wickedness of the hearts of sinners; and strengthen he graces of believers in their daily conflict with Satan, sin, and this evil world. They must live in this world, but they are not of it, and are forbidden to conform to it. This marks the difference between the followers of Christ and mere professors. The friendship of the world is more fatal than its enmity; the latter can only kill the body, but the former murders many precious souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even as many of Israel ... - These words show that the writer has especially in view the generation which came to man's estate immediately after the close of the wars with the Canaanites <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-1.htm">Joshua 23:1</a>.

These nations were left for a double purpose: in the first instance, to be instrumental, by their inroads, in promoting the moral and spiritual discipline of the Israelites; and also to subserve the design of making them acquainted with war, in order that the young, more especially, who were total strangers to it, might learn the use of weapons and the art of wielding them.The nations left to prove Israel mentioned, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/3-1.htm" title="Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;...">Judges 3:1-4</a></span>.

In those passages it is used of their moral probation, of proving or testing their faith and obedience; but here it is rather in the sense of "to exercise" or "to accustom them," to train them to war. A considerable period of <span class="accented">rest</span> had followed Joshua's conquest, during which the younger Israelites had no experience of war; but if they were to keep their hold of Canaan, it was needful that the warlike spirit should be kept up in their breasts. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And when the Lord raised them up judges, and was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge (i.e., as long as the judge was living), because the Lord had compassion upon their sighing, by reason of them that oppressed them, and vexed them (&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1511; only occurs again as a verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-8.htm">Joel 2:8</a>): it came to pass when the judge was dead, that they returned and acted more corruptly than their fathers," i.e., they turned again to idolatry even more grievously than their fathers had done under the previous judges. "They did not let fall from their deeds," i.e., they did not cease from their evil deeds, and "from their stiff-necked way." &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, hard, is to be understood as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm">Exodus 33:3</a>, where Israel is called a hard-necked people which did not bend under obedience to the commandments of God. </body></html>
