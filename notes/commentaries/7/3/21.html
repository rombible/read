The text expressly says, <span class="ital">The Lord raised up Ehud; </span>and it is well known that all the deliverances which the Jews had under the judges, were directed and conducted by the immediate hand of God, according as the people, by their repentance, became fit to receive them. A divine warrant, in such a case, is a clear ground to go upon, but it can be no precedent for others to go upon, who have no divine warrant at all, but quite the contrary. What are reason and understanding given us for, but to distinguish upon cases and circumstances?” As reasons why God excited Ehud to this action, it may be observed, that Eglon had been the aggressor, and that he was the oppressor of God’s people, and held them under a cruel subjection and bondage; that he was undoubtedly guilty of great injustice and violence toward them, and, in all probability, continued to make many thousands of them miserable daily, by means of their servitude, which he had no right to do. Therefore God, who had called Ehud to the office of delivering and governing Israel, stirred him up on this occasion, to take this method of cutting off their enemy and oppressor.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-30 When Israel sins again, God raises up a new oppressor. The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Probably Ehud's first message <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-19.htm">Judges 3:19</a> had been delivered to the attendants, and by them carried to the king. Now Ehud is admitted to the king's presence, into the cool upper chamber.<p>I have a message from God unto thee - Ehud believed himself to be accomplishing the divine mandate, and so his words were true in a certain sense. But it was also a stratagem to cause the king to rise, that the thrust might be sure. (The king rose at once, in true Oriental respect for a divine message, or from fear, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-24.htm">Joshua 9:24</a>.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21-26.

Ehud was "the son of Gera." This probably means that he was a descendant of Gera, since Gera himself, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-3.htm">1 Chronicles 8:3</a>, was a son of Bela the son of Benjamin, and therefore was a grandson of Benjamin; and Shimei the contemporary of David, a man belonging to the tribe of Benjamin, is also called a son of Gera in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>. At the same time, it is possible that the name Gera does not refer to the same person in these different passages, but that the name was repeated again and again in the same family. "A man shut with regard to his right hand," i.e., hindered in the use of his right hand, not necessarily crippled, but in all probability disabled through want of use from his youth upwards. That the expression does not mean crippled, is confirmed by the fact that it is used again in connection with the 700 brave slingers in the army of the Benjaminites in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>, and it certainly cannot be supposed that they were all actual cripples. So much is certain, however, that it does not mean &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, qui utraque manu pro dextera utebatur (lxx, Vulg.), since &#1488;&#1496;&#1512; signifies clausit (shut) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-16.htm">Psalm 69:16</a>. It is merely with reference to what follows that this peculiarity is so distinctly mentioned. -  The Israelites sent a present by him to king Eglon. &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; does not mean in, but through, his hand, i.e., through his intervention, for others were actually employed to carry the present (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-18.htm">Judges 3:18</a>), so that Ehud merely superintended the matter. Minchah, a gift or present, is no doubt a euphemism for tribute, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>. </body></html>
