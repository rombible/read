Both men ought to have protected the women in the house, even though at the expense of their lives, or thrown themselves on God's providence. It should be noted, however, that the guilt of such a foul outrage is not fastened on the general population of Gibeah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The man took his concubine; </span> being willing to expose her rather than the daughter of his host, who had expressed such a singular care and affection for him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the men would not hearken to him,....

If the offer of the host strikes us as immoral, the conduct of the Levite makes an even worse impression: he sacrifices his concubine-wife to save himself.

When he saw the traveller in the market-place of the town, he asked him whither he was going and whence he came; and when he had heard the particulars concerning his descent and his journey, he received him into his house. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18</a>), "and I walk at the house of Jehovah, and no one receives me into his house" (Seb. Schm., etc.); not "I am going to the house of Jehovah" (Ros., Berth., etc.), for &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; does not signify to go to a place, for which the simple accusative is used either with or without &#1492; local. It either means "to go through a place" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>, etc.), or "to go with a person," or, when applied to things, "to go about with anything" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-5.htm">Job 31:5</a>, and Ges. Thes. p. 378). Moreover, in this instance the Levite was not going to the house of Jehovah (i.e., the tabernacle), but, as he expressly told the old man, from Bethlehem to the outermost sides of the mountains of Ephraim. The words in question explain the reason why he was staying in the market-place. Because he served at the house of Jehovah, no one in Gibeah would receive him into his house, <p>(Note: As Seb. Schmidt correctly observes, "the argument is taken from the indignity shown him: the Lord thinks me worthy to minister to Him, as a Levite, in His house, and there is not one of the people of the Lord who thinks me worthy to receive his hospitality.")<p>although, as he adds in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-19.htm">Judges 19:19</a>, he had everything with him that was requisite for his wants. "We have both straw and fodder for our asses, and bread and wine for me and thy maid, and for the young man with thy servants. No want of anything at all," so as to cause him to be burdensome to his host. By the words "thy maid" and "thy servants" he means himself and his concubine, describing himself and his wife, according to the obsequious style of the East in olden times, as servants of the man from whom he was expecting a welcome.</body></html>
