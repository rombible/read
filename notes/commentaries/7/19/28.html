The omission of every detail, the narration of the naked facts in the simplest words, without pausing to say so much as a single word respecting the Levite’s or the old man’s feelings, is a striking example of the difference of the historic method of ancient and modern times.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door.

Both men ought to have protected the women in the house, even though at the expense of their lives, or thrown themselves on God's providence.

To these Abarbinel adds, the cold of the night, being without her clothes, or anything to cover her: <p>then the man took her up upon an ass; and carried off her dead body, without making any remonstrance to the inhabitants, from whom he could not expect that any justice would be done him: <p>and the man rose up, and got him unto his place; to his city on one side Mount Ephraim, to which he made as much haste as he could, instead of going to the house of God at Shiloh, as he proposed; for now the circumstances of things were changed with him, and instead of sacrificing and giving praise to God in his house, his business was to seek for justice from the tribes of Israel. <p>(w) Ut supra.
