Other versions concur with Josephus, in representing the reason for the flight from her husband's house to be, that she was disgusted with him, through frequent brawls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Against him, </span> i.e. against her faith given to him, or to his wrong; or, <span class="ital">with him</span>, i.e. in his house; or whilst she lived with him, which is opposed to her <span class="ital">going away</span>, which here follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Went away from him; </span> either for fear of his severe rebukes or punishment, or because her heart was alienated from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Four whole months, </span> Heb. some <span class="ital">days</span>, to wit, <span class="ital">four months</span>; or, <span class="ital">a year</span> (so days commonly signify) and four months; wherein not only site sinned, but her father by some indulgence and connivance at her sin, and neglect of just endeavours for her reconciliation to her husband, the ill effects whereof he speedily felt, in the loss of his daughter in so dreadful a manner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his concubine played the whore against him,....

The Targum is, she despised him; so Kimchi and Ben Gersom interpret it of her declining and turning aside from him, and returning to her father's house, as follows: and indeed, had she been guilty of such a crime, one would think he would never have sought after her to reconcile her, and take her again, since she not only deserved to be put away, but to be put to death according to the law of God: <p>and went away from him to her father's house to Bethlehemjudah; where she was received, as she knew she should, having a parent perhaps too indulgent, and which was an encouragement to her to leave her husband: <p>and was there some whole months or a year and four whole months, according to Ben Gersom; so Kimchi and Ben Melech observe the copulative "and" is wanting, which is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-7.htm">1 Samuel 27:7</a> and "yamim, days", is so the times used for a year, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>. <p>(i) "apud eum", Pagninus, Piscator; "cum eo", Junius &amp; Tremellius.

LXX. cod. A reads <span class="ital">was angry with him</span>; this suits the context, which implies a quarrel, but not unfaithfulness, on the woman’s part; she left him in anger and returned to her father’s house, whither the Levite followed to pacify her (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-3.htm" title="And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly to her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.">Jdg 19:3</a></span> f.). How are we to account for the reading of the text? Moore ingeniously suggests that by the transposition of two letters <span class="ital">she was angry</span> (<span class="ital">te’ĕnaph</span>) might have become ‘she committed adultery’ (<span class="ital">tin’aph</span>), which was altered by the Jews to ‘played the harlot,’ on the ground that only a wedded wife could be said to commit adultery. It is simpler to suppose that the original <span class="ital">she was angry</span> was deliberately altered under a misconception of the relationship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the space of four months</span>] lit. <span class="ital">days, four months; days</span> sometimes has the specific sense of <span class="ital">a year</span>, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-7.htm" title="And the time that David dwelled in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.">1 Samuel 27:7</a> ‘a full year and four months’; cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm" title="And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and your victuals. So the Levite went in.">Jdg 17:10</a> ‘by the year,’ lit. ‘by the days.’ But <span class="ital">days</span> can also have an indefinite sense, <span class="ital">some time</span>, as probably here.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Played the whore</span>, etc. Perhaps the phrase only means that she revolted from him and left him. Her returning to her father's house, and his anxiety to make up the quarrel, both discourage taking the phrase in its worst sense. <span class="cmt_word">Four whole months</span>.

It was situated "in the valley which stretches to Beth-rehob." This valley is the upper part of the Huleh lowland, through which the central source of the Jordan (Leddan) flows, and by which Laish-Dan, the present Tell el Kadi, stood (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>). Beth-rehob is most probably the same place as the Rehob mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>, and the Beth-rehob of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, which is there used to designate a part of Syria, and for which Rehob only is also used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-8.htm">Judges 18:8</a>. Robinson (Bibl. Res. pp. 371ff.) supposes it to be the castle of Hunin or Honin, on the south-west of Tell el Kadi; but this is hardly correct (see the remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>, Pent. p. 709). The city, which lay in ashes, was afterwards rebuilt by the Danites, and called Dan, from the name of the founder of their tribe; and the ruins are still to be seen, as already affirmed, on the southern slope of the Tell el Kadi (see Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 391-2, and the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>). </body></html>
