If it was possible to frustrate the vile assault of these wretches in this way it must have been possible to frustrate it altogether. There is something terribly repulsive in the selfishness which could thus make a Levite sacrifice a defenceless woman, and that woman his wife, for a whole night to such brutalisation. The remark of St. Gregory is very weighty: “<span class= "ital">Minus peccatum admittere ut gravius evitetur est a scelere victimas offerre Deo.”</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-24.htm" title="Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.">Jdg 19:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, here is my daughter, </span>&c. — The master of the house came at last to a resolution that it was less wickedness to prostitute the women to their lusts than the Levite. The dilemma to which he was reduced was indeed dreadful, nevertheless he is not to be justified in the proposal which he makes, no more than Lot was to be justified in a similar case, in offering his two daughters to satisfy the lusts of the men of Sodom. Although of two evils we must choose the less, yet, as we have there observed, “of two sins we must choose neither, nor ever do evil that good may come.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door.

Both men ought to have protected the women in the house, even though at the expense of their lives, or thrown themselves on God's providence. It should be noted, however, that the guilt of such a foul outrage is not fastened on the general population of Gibeah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He offers this to avoid a greater and more unnatural sin, which he thought they designed; but it seems they did not, their abuse being confined to the woman, and not extended to the man, who also was in their power, if they had lusted after him. But this offer was sinful, because he offered that which was not in his nor in the man’s power to dispose of, even the chastity of his daughter, and the man’s wife; and because no man must do any evil, though never so small, for the prevention of any evil of sin or misery, or for the procuring of the greatest good, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-8.htm" title="And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.">Romans 3:8</a></span>; though his sin was much mitigated by his ignorance, by his honest and generous intention of protecting a stranger, by the force which was in some sort put upon him, and by the suddenness and violence of the temptation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, here is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine,....

When he saw the traveller in the market-place of the town, he asked him whither he was going and whence he came; and when he had heard the particulars concerning his descent and his journey, he received him into his house. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18</a>), "and I walk at the house of Jehovah, and no one receives me into his house" (Seb. Schm., etc.); not "I am going to the house of Jehovah" (Ros., Berth., etc.), for &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; does not signify to go to a place, for which the simple accusative is used either with or without &#1492; local. It either means "to go through a place" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>, etc.), or "to go with a person," or, when applied to things, "to go about with anything" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-5.htm">Job 31:5</a>, and Ges. Thes. p. 378). Moreover, in this instance the Levite was not going to the house of Jehovah (i.e., the tabernacle), but, as he expressly told the old man, from Bethlehem to the outermost sides of the mountains of Ephraim. The words in question explain the reason why he was staying in the market-place. Because he served at the house of Jehovah, no one in Gibeah would receive him into his house, <p>(Note: As Seb. Schmidt correctly observes, "the argument is taken from the indignity shown him: the Lord thinks me worthy to minister to Him, as a Levite, in His house, and there is not one of the people of the Lord who thinks me worthy to receive his hospitality.")<p>although, as he adds in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-19.htm">Judges 19:19</a>, he had everything with him that was requisite for his wants. "We have both straw and fodder for our asses, and bread and wine for me and thy maid, and for the young man with thy servants. No want of anything at all," so as to cause him to be burdensome to his host. By the words "thy maid" and "thy servants" he means himself and his concubine, describing himself and his wife, according to the obsequious style of the East in olden times, as servants of the man from whom he was expecting a welcome.</body></html>
