Jebus being still, though not entirely (Jud 1:8) in the possession of the old inhabitants, the Levite resisted the advice of his attendant to enter it and determined rather to press forward to pass the night in Gibeah, which he knew was occupied by Israelites. The distance from Beth-lehem to Jerusalem is about six miles. The event showed that it would have been better to have followed the advice of his attendant&#8212;to have trusted themselves among aliens than among their own countrymen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the man would not tarry that night,....
