The whole verse is a circumstantial clause explanatory of what precedes, and the following verbs &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, are simply a continuation of the first clause, and therefore to be rendered as pluperfects.

The ephod was an imitation of the high priest's shoulder-dress (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>). The teraphim were images of household gods, penates, who were worshipped as the givers of earthly prosperity, and as oracles (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a> it is observed, in explanation of this unlawful conduct, that at that time there was no king in Israel, and every one did what was right in his own eyes.</body></html>
