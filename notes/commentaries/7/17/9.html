Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jonathan's state without a home gives us vivid picture of what must have been the condition of many Levites. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the man departed &#8230; to sojourn where he could find a place&#8212;A competent provision being secured for every member of the Levitical order, his wandering about showed him to have been a person of a roving disposition or unsettled habits.

Bible), had stolen 1100 shekels of silver (about 135) from his mother. This is very apparent from the words which he spoke to his mother (v. 2): "The thousand and hundred shekels of silver which were taken from thee (the singular &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; refers to the silver), about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears (i.e., didst so utter the curse that among others I also heard it), behold, this silver is with me; I have taken it." &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, to swear, used to denote a malediction or curse (cf. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). He seems to have been impelled to make this confession by the fear of his mother's curse. But his mother praised him for it, - "Blessed be my son of Jehovah," - partly because she saw in it a proof that there still existed a germ of the fear of God, but in all probability chiefly because she was about to dedicate the silver to Jehovah; for, when her son had given it back to her, she said (v. 3), "I have sanctified the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son, to make an image and molten work." The perfect &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not to be taken in the sense of the pluperfect, "I had sanctified it," but is expressive of an act just performed: I have sanctified it, I declare herewith that I do sanctify it. "And now I give it back to thee," namely, to appropriate to thy house of God.</body></html>
