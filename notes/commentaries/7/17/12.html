Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ten shekels - About 25 shillings to 26 shillings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Micah consecrated the Levite&#8212;Hebrew, "filled his hand." This act of consecration was not less unlawful for Micah to perform than for this Levite to receive (see on [226]Jud 18:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Consecrated the Levite, </span> to be a priest, for which he thought a consecration necessary, as knowing that the Levites were no less excluded from the priestâ€™s office than the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Became his priest, </span> instead of his son, whom he had consecrated for want of a fitter, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a></span>; but now seems to restrain him from the exercise of that office, and to devolve it wholly upon the Levite, who was nearer akin to it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Micah consecrated the Levite,....

The whole verse is a circumstantial clause explanatory of what precedes, and the following verbs &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, are simply a continuation of the first clause, and therefore to be rendered as pluperfects. Micah's beth Elohim (house of God) was a domestic temple belonging to Micah's house, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-15.htm">Judges 18:15-18</a>. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491; &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, to fill the hand, i.e., to invest with the priesthood, to institute as priest (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37</a>). The ephod was an imitation of the high priest's shoulder-dress (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>). The teraphim were images of household gods, penates, who were worshipped as the givers of earthly prosperity, and as oracles (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a> it is observed, in explanation of this unlawful conduct, that at that time there was no king in Israel, and every one did what was right in his own eyes.</body></html>
