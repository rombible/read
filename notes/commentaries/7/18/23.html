Dan showed himself in this proceeding like “a serpent on the way, an adder in the path” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-17.htm" title="Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that bites the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.">Genesis 49:17</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-22.htm" title="And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.">Deuteronomy 33:22</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Were gathered together - literally, "were called together." The men, who were all Micah's workmen, were probably in the fields with their master at the time of the robbery. When the women saw what was done they gave the alarm, and Micah called the men together as quickly as possible, and pursued the Danites and overtook them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-26. the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together&#8212;The robbers of the chapel being soon detected, a hot pursuit was forthwith commenced by Micah, at the head of a considerable body of followers. The readiness with which they joined in the attempt to recover the stolen articles affords a presumption that the advantages of the chapel had been open to all in the neighborhood; and the importance which Micah, like Laban, attached to his teraphim, is seen by the urgency with which he pursued the thieves, and the risk of his life in attempting to procure their restoration. Finding his party, however, not a match for the Danites, he thought it prudent to desist, well knowing the rule which was then prevalent in the land, that<p>"They should take who had the power,<p>And they should keep who could."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they cried unto the children of Dan,.... When they had got pretty near them, and in their hearing, they called to them aloud, and desired they would stop, having something to say to them: <p>and they turned their faces; that is, the Danites turned and looked at them, and stopped to hear what they had to say to them; these were they who were in the rear in marching: <p>and said unto Micah; who was at the head of them: <p>what aileth thee that thou comest with such a company? as if he intended to attack them in an hostile way, and therefore asks what should be the occasion of it? what affront had been given him, what injury had been done him, that had provoked him to come out and follow them in such a manner? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they cried unto the children of Dan.

It is the idea of the clan, or family, or tribe which causes the phrase. Just as <span class="accented">Israel</span> or <span class="accented">Judah</span> designates the whole nation, or the whole tribe, under the name of their patriarch, so here Micah would include all the clan who dwelt in Micah's house; and hence the Danites speak of Micah being gathered together. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then the five spies went up, sc., into Micah's house of God, which must therefore have been in an upper room of the building (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>), and took the image, ephod, etc., whilst the priest stood before the door with the 600 armed men. With the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; the narrative passes from the aorist or historical tense &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; into the perfect. "The perfects do not denote the coming and taking on the part of the five men as a continuation of the previous account, but place the coming and taking in the same sphere of time as that to which the following clause, 'and the priest stood,' etc., belongs" (Bertheau). But in order to explain what appears very surprising, viz., that the priest should have stood before the gate whilst his house of God was being robbed, the course which the affair took is explained more clearly afterwards in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm">Judges 18:19</a>, in the form of a circumstantial clause. Consequently the verbs in these verses ought to be rendered as pluperfects, and the different clauses comprised in one period, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a> forming the protasis, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm">Judges 18:19</a> the apodosis. "Namely, when those (five) men had come into Micah's house, and had taken the image of the ephod, etc., and the priest had said to them, What are ye doing? they had said to him, Be silent, lay thy hand upon thy mouth and go with us, and become a father and priest to us (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>). Is it better to be a priest to the house of a single man, or to a tribe and family in Israel?" The combination &#1492;&#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1491; &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; (the ephod-pesel), i.e., the image belonging to the ephod, may be explained on the ground, that the use of the ephod as a means of ascertaining the will of God presupposes the existence of an image of Jehovah, and does not prove that the ephod served as a covering for the Pesel. The priest put on the ephod when he was about to inquire of God. The &#1488;&#1493; in the second question is different from &#1488;&#1501;, and signifies "or rather" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>), indicating an improvement upon the first question (see Ewald, 352, a.). Consequently it is not a sign of a later usage of speech, as Bertheau supposes. The word &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (unto a family) serves as a more minute definition or limitation of &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; (to a tribe). </body></html>
