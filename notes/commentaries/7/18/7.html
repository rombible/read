From Mount Ephraim, and Micah's house there: <p>and came to Laish; which, according to Bunting (s), was one hundred and four miles from Mount Ephraim, and so many he makes it to be from Jerusalem; it lay at the furthest northern border of the land of Canaan, at the foot of Mount Lebanon, near the fountain of Jordan; it was four miles from Paneas, as Jerom says (t), as you go to Tyre; it is the Caesarea Philippi of the New Testament, and the same that is called Leshem; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>, <p>and saw the people that were therein; went into the city, and made their observations on the inhabitants of it, their number, strength, and manner of living: <p>how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; the inhabitants of Zidon, whose customs they might imitate, whose laws they might use, and might be under their government, since they are said to have no magistrate within themselves; and their carelessness and confidence might arise from their strong fortresses; or rather because they thought their city, and the land adjacent to it, did not belong to the land of Israel, and did not know that the Israelites made any pretensions to it, and therefore were quite easy, and in no fear of them; had no watchmen to guard their city, and did not take care to furnish themselves with weapons of war for their defence, even as the Zidonians; who, besides their city being a strong and fortified one, were in no fear of the Israelites, because their city was not in the land of Canaan, only the border of it reached to it: <p>and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in anything; to restrain them from vice, and punish them for it, or even to reprove and correct them, and so put them to shame; or put any mark of infamy and disgrace upon them in a public manner, that might shame them; hence they lived in a disorderly and dissolute manner, whereby they became the more easy prey to others: or the sense is, there was no king, nor an heir of the kingdom, as Kimchi interprets it, so that there were none to contest his right to the government of the place, or to accuse another, and put him to shame for taking it away from him. Jarchi takes the sense to be, that none needed to turn back his neighbour empty, when he asked anything of him for his relief, since there was no want of anything in the land, as after observed; but the first sense seems best: <p>and they were far from the Zidonians; who were the only people that could help them, being in friendship with them; and it may be they were under their government, as before observed; they are said (u) to be about eleven miles from them; Josephus (w) says, a day's journey: <p>and had no business with any man; no trade or commerce, but lived independent of others, and within themselves, their land affording them everything sufficient for them.

Does this mean the source at Tell el-Ḳâḍi, or the other source 3½ m. to the S.E., at Bânias (the Caesarea Philippi of the Gospels1[62])? Most authorities adopt the identification with Tell el-Ḳâḍi, where the Jordan, at this point called by the Arabs Nahr Leddan, gushes in powerful volume out of the western side of the Tell. G. A. Smith, however, prefers the other site (<span class="ital">Hist. Geogr.</span>, pp. 473, 480 f.). In the background of the district rises the imposing snow-capped mountain of Hermon; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm" title="O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.">Psalm 42:6</a>.

Though remote from the suzerain city, the inhabitants felt secure enough, and never suspected attack from outside.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for there was … in any thing</span>] The text is overloaded and partially corrupt. Read perhaps … <span class="ital">quiet and secure, and there was no want of any thing that is in the earth</span> (as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-10.htm" title="When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God has given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.">Jdg 18:10</a></span>), <span class="ital">in possession of wealth</span> (?). The phrase <span class="ital">possessing authority</span>, lit. <span class="ital">restraint</span> (?) cannot be right. The LXX took the word rendered <span class="ital">restraint</span> (?), i.e. <span class="ital">‘eṣer</span>, to mean <span class="ital">treasure</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">’ôṣar</span>; altering one letter we might read <span class="ital">‘osher</span> = <span class="ital">wealth</span>, but the corruption may well be deeper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with any man</span>] The LXX., cod.

The people of Laish were not only far from the friendly power of Phoenicia, but they had not allied themselves with their Syrian neighbours (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.">2 Samuel 10:6</a>); this explains more distinctly why they fell such an easy prey to the Danites.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Laish</span>.

The name is strangely corrupted in the Septuagint of ver. 29 of this chapter into <span class="accented">Oulamais</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a> into <span class="accented">Lesem-dan.</span> St. Jerome, misled by the Septuagint, has <span class="accented">Lesem Dan.</span> Laish was situated four Roman miles from Bahias, on the road to.

Robinson identifies it unhesitatingly with <span class="accented">Tell-el-Kady</span>, "the mount of the judge" (where <span class="accented">Kady</span> has the same meaning as <span class="accented">Dan</span>), close to the great fountain, "one of the largest fountains in the world," called <span class="accented">el-Leddan</span>, which is the source of the lesser Jordan (Josephus), and which may very possibly be the ultimate form of ed-Dan, corrupted into Eddan, el-Eddan, Led-dan, el-Leddan, by successive incorporations of the article <span class="accented">el</span> into the word itself, of which there are other examples. The remainder of this verse is exceedingly obscure; a probable translation is as follows: "And they saw the people that was in the midst of it dwelling in security after the manner of the Zidonians, '<span class="accented">quiet and secure</span>, <span class="accented">and none doing any injury to any one in the land</span>, <span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>;' and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man." The words in italics are probably a poetical quotation, descriptive of the people of Laish, which would account for the peculiar diction and the grammatical changes; for whereas the word <span class="accented">dwelling</span> is in the feminine gender, agreeing with <span class="accented">people</span>, the words <span class="accented">quiet</span> and <span class="accented">secure</span> and <span class="accented">possessing</span> are in the masculine, which can be readily accounted for if they are a quotation. This would also account for the tautology, "dwelling in security," "quiet and secure," and for the poetical character of the phrase "<span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>," and for the unusual form of the word here rendered <span class="accented">wealth</span> (<span class="accented">etzer</span> with an ain, instead of the usual <span class="accented">otzar</span> with an aleph), in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate and Gesenius, who derive the meaning of <span class="accented">wealth</span> from <span class="accented">collecting</span>, from which the common word <span class="accented">atzereth</span> derives its meaning of a <span class="accented">collection</span> or <span class="accented">congregation</span> of people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This took place at a time when Israel had no king, and the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance for themselves to dwell in, because until that day no such portion had fallen to them among the tribes as an inheritance. To the expression &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488; (had not fallen) we must supply &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; as the subject from the previous clause; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; signifies in the character of a nachalah, i.e., of a possession that could be transmitted as hereditary property from father to son. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;, to fall, is used with reference to the falling of the lot (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>, etc.). The general statement, that as yet no inheritance had fallen to the tribe of Dan by lot, has its limitation in the context. As the Danites, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a>, sent out five men from Zorea and Eshtaol, and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a>, six hundred men equipped for fight went out to Laish, which the spies had discovered to be a place well fitted for a settlement, and had settled there, it is very evident from this that the Danites were not absolutely without an inheritance, but that hitherto they had not received one sufficient for their wants. The emigrants themselves were already settled in Zorea and Eshtaol, two of the towns that had fallen to the tribe of Dan by lot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>). Moreover, the six hundred equipped Danites, who went out of these towns, were only a very small part of the tribe of Danites, which numbered 64,400 males of twenty years old and upwards at the last census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-43.htm">Numbers 26:43</a>). For a tribe of this size the land assigned by Joshua to the tribe of Dan, with all the towns that it contained, was amply sufficient. But from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a> we learn that the Amorites forced the Danites into the mountains, and would not allow them to come down into the plain. Consequently they were confined to a few towns situated upon the sides or tops of the mountains, which did not supply all the room they required. Feeling themselves too weak to force back the Canaanites and exterminate them, one portion of the Danites preferred to seek an inheritance for themselves somewhere else in the land. This enterprise and emigration are described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a>. The time cannot be determined with perfect certainty, as all that can be clearly inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-12.htm">Judges 18:12</a>, as compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>, is, that it took place some time before the days of Samson. Many expositors have therefore assigned it to the period immediately following the defeat of Jabin by Barak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-24.htm">Judges 4:24</a>), because it was not till after the overthrow of this powerful king of the Canaanites that conquests were possible in the north of Canaan, and the tribe of Dan at that time still remained in ships (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>), so that it had not yet left the territory assigned it by the sea-shore (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a>). But these arguments have neither of them any force; for there is nothing surprising in the fact that Danites should still be found by the sea-shore in the time of Deborah, even if Danite families from Zorea and Eshtaol had settled in Laish long before, seeing that these emigrants formed but a small fraction of the whole tribe, and the rest remained in the possessions assigned them by Joshua. Moreover, the strengthening of the force of the Canaanites, and the extension of their dominion in the north, did not take place till 150 years after Joshua, in the days of Jabin; so that long before Jabin the town of Laish may have been conquered by the Danites, and taken possession of by them. In all probability this took place shortly after the death of Joshua, as we may infer from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a> (see the exposition of this verse). </body></html>
