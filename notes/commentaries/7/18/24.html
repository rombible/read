And Jacob said, You shall not give me any thing: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.">Genesis 30:31</a>). The expression seems to be intended to show scorn for Micah; and perhaps it is from missing this element that the LXX. soften it down into “my graven image,” and the Chaldee to “my fear.” “My gods which I made” would be a very ordinary expression for the Greeks, who called a sculptor a “god-maker” (<span class= "ital">theopoios</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but was startling on the lips of an Israelite. Micah pathetically asks “What have I more?” but we may well hope that his present loss was his ultimate gain, and that he found the true God in place of the lost gods which he had made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-24.htm" title="And he said, You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that you say to me, What ails you?">Jdg 18:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">My gods which I made — </span>Or, rather, <span class="ital">my god, </span>as the Hebrew word generally signifies, meaning the image, which he considered as a symbol of God’s presence with him; for he could not be so stupid as to think it to be the <span class="ital">great Jehovah, </span>who made heaven and earth, and whom he professed to worship, but merely as a medium through which he offered up his worship to him, as many of the heathen did. <span class="ital">What have I more? — </span>I value nothing I have in comparison of what you have taken away. Which zeal for idolatrous trash may shame multitudes that call themselves Christians, and yet value their worldly conveniences more than all the concerns of their own salvation. Is Micah thus fond of his false gods? And how ought we to be affected toward the true God? Let us reckon our communion with God our greatest gain; and the loss of God the sorest loss.

Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Were gathered together - literally, "were called together." The men, who were all Micah's workmen, were probably in the fields with their master at the time of the robbery. When the women saw what was done they gave the alarm, and Micah called the men together as quickly as possible, and pursued the Danites and overtook them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-26. the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together&#8212;The robbers of the chapel being soon detected, a hot pursuit was forthwith commenced by Micah, at the head of a considerable body of followers. The readiness with which they joined in the attempt to recover the stolen articles affords a presumption that the advantages of the chapel had been open to all in the neighborhood; and the importance which Micah, like Laban, attached to his teraphim, is seen by the urgency with which he pursued the thieves, and the risk of his life in attempting to procure their restoration. Finding his party, however, not a match for the Danites, he thought it prudent to desist, well knowing the rule which was then prevalent in the land, that<p>"They should take who had the power,<p>And they should keep who could."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So far was he besotted with superstition and idolatry, that he esteemed those gods which were man’s work. But he could not be so stupid as to think these were indeed the great Jehovah that made heaven and earth; but only a lower sort of gods, by whom, as mediators, he offered up his worship unto the true God, as it is manifest divers of the heathens did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">What have I more</span>?

E, a passage which shews several points of resemblance to the present. For <span class="ital">my gods</span>, Vulgate deos meos, we might render <span class="ital">my God</span>, offensive though the idea is to us; Micah was a worshipper of Jehovah, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Jdg 17:5</a>.

With the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; the narrative passes from the aorist or historical tense &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; into the perfect. "The perfects do not denote the coming and taking on the part of the five men as a continuation of the previous account, but place the coming and taking in the same sphere of time as that to which the following clause, 'and the priest stood,' etc., belongs" (Bertheau). But in order to explain what appears very surprising, viz., that the priest should have stood before the gate whilst his house of God was being robbed, the course which the affair took is explained more clearly afterwards in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm">Judges 18:19</a>, in the form of a circumstantial clause. Consequently the verbs in these verses ought to be rendered as pluperfects, and the different clauses comprised in one period, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a> forming the protasis, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm">Judges 18:19</a> the apodosis. "Namely, when those (five) men had come into Micah's house, and had taken the image of the ephod, etc., and the priest had said to them, What are ye doing? they had said to him, Be silent, lay thy hand upon thy mouth and go with us, and become a father and priest to us (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>). Is it better to be a priest to the house of a single man, or to a tribe and family in Israel?" The combination &#1492;&#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1491; &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; (the ephod-pesel), i.e., the image belonging to the ephod, may be explained on the ground, that the use of the ephod as a means of ascertaining the will of God presupposes the existence of an image of Jehovah, and does not prove that the ephod served as a covering for the Pesel. The priest put on the ephod when he was about to inquire of God. The &#1488;&#1493; in the second question is different from &#1488;&#1501;, and signifies "or rather" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>), indicating an improvement upon the first question (see Ewald, 352, a.). Consequently it is not a sign of a later usage of speech, as Bertheau supposes. The word &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (unto a family) serves as a more minute definition or limitation of &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; (to a tribe). </body></html>
