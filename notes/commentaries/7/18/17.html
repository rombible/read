Their journey led them through the territory of Judah, and their first halting place was "behind," that is, on the west of Kirjath-jearim, on a spot called afterwards "the camp of Dan." Prosecuting the northern route, they skirted the base of the Ephraimite hills. On approaching the neighborhood of Micah's residence, the spies having given information that a private sanctuary was kept there, the priest of which had rendered them important service when on their exploring expedition, it was unanimously agreed that both he and the furniture of the establishment would be a valuable acquisition to their proposed settlement. A plan of spoliation was immediately formed. While the armed men stood sentinels at the gates, the five spies broke into the chapel, pillaged the images and vestments, and succeeded in bribing the priest also by a tempting offer to transfer his services to their new colony. Taking charge of the ephod, the teraphim, and the graven image, he "went in the midst of the people"&#8212;a central position assigned him in the march, perhaps for his personal security; but more probably in imitation of the place appointed for the priests and the ark, in the middle of the congregated tribes, on the marches through the wilderness. This theft presents a curious medley of low morality and strong religious feeling. The Danites exemplified a deep-seated principle of our nature&#8212;that men have religious affections, which must have an object on which these may be exercised, while they are often not very discriminating in the choice of the objects. In proportion to the slender influence religion wields over the heart, the greater is the importance attached to external rites; and in the exact observance of these, the conscience is fully satisfied, and seldom or never molested by reflections on the breach of minor morals.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Come in thither, </span> to wit, into the house, and that part of it where those things were. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the entering of the gate; </span> whither they had drawn him forth that they might without noise or hinderance take them away. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the five men that went out to spy the land went up and came thither,....

It is impossible to recover the original form of the text here.

In consequence of the favourable account of the spies who returned, certain Danites departed from Zorea and Eshtaol, to the number of 600 men, accoutred with weapons of war, with their families and their possessions in cattle and goods (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-21.htm">Judges 18:21</a>), and encamped by the way at Kirjath-jearim (i.e., Kuriyet Enab; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), in the tribe territory of Judah, at a place which received the permanent name of Mahaneh Dan (camp of Dan) from that circumstance, and was situated behind, i.e., to the west of, Kirjath-jearim (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>). The fact that this locality received a standing name from the circumstance described, compels us to assume that the Danites had encamped there for a considerable time, for reasons which we cannot determine from our want of other information. The emigrants may possibly have first of all assembled here, and prepared and equipped themselves for their further march.  </body></html>
