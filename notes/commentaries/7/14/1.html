Children ought not to marry, nor to move toward it, without the advice and consent of their parents. They that do, as Bishop Hall speaks, unchild themselves. Parents have a property in their children, as parts of themselves. In marriage this property is transferred. It is, therefore, not only unkind and ungrateful, but palpably unjust, to alienate this property, without their concurrence. Whoso thus <span class="ital">robbeth his father or mother, </span>stealing from them himself, who is nearer and dearer to them than their goods, <span class="ital">and </span>yet <span class="ital">saith, It is no transgression, the same is the companion of a destroyer, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-24.htm" title="Whoever robs his father or his mother, and said, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.">Proverbs 28:24</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-4 As far as Samson's marriage was a common case, it was weak and foolish of him to set his affections upon a daughter of the Philistines. Shall one, not only an Israelite, but a Nazarite, devoted to the Lord, covet to become one with a worshipper of Dagon? It does not appear that he had any reason to think her wise or virtuous, or any way likely to be a help meet for him; but he saw something in her agreeable to his fancy. He that, in the choice of a wife, is only guided by his eye, and governed by his fancy, must afterwards thank himself if he find a Philistine in his arms. Yet it was well done not to proceed till Samson had made his parents acquainted with the matter. Children ought not to marry, nor to move towards it, without the advice and consent of their parents. Samson's parents did well to dissuade him from yoking himself unequally with unbelievers. It seems that it pleased God to leave Samson to follow his own inclinations, intending to bring out good from his conduct; and his parents consented, because he was bent upon it. However, his example is not recorded for us to do likewise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Timnath - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a> and note.

During their period of ascendency, the Philistine invaders had settled in the towns; and the intercourse between them and the Israelites was often of such a friendly and familiar character as to issue in matrimonial relations. Moreover, the Philistines were not in the number of the seven devoted nations of Canaan [De 7:1-3]&#8212;with whom the law forbade them to marry.Samson desires to wife a daughter of the Philistines of Timnath; and this of the Lord, for an occasion against them, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/14-1.htm" title="And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines....">Judges 14:1-4</a></span>.

Judah is said to go up to it, because the place where he lived lay below it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-13.htm">Genesis 38:13</a>, but Samson is said to go down to it, because he lived above it. The Jews (t) differ about the reconciliation of these two places; some say there were two of this name, the one is a descent, and the other is an ascent; others say there was but one, so situated, that they that came to it on one side ascended, and they that came to it on the other side descended. Bochart (u) approves of the former. According to Bunting (w), this was twelve miles from Eshtaol, where Samson lived: <p>and saw a woman in Timnath, of the daughters of the Philistines; who at this time dwelt there; he saw no doubt many other women besides her, but he took special notice of her, and entertained a particular affection for her; or, in other words, on sight of her fell in love with her. <p>(t) T.

In what the miracle consisted is explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-20.htm">Judges 13:20</a>, in the words, "when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar;" that is to say, in the fact that a flame issued from the rock, as in the case of Gideon's sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>), and consumed the sacrifice. And the angel of the Lord ascended in this flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell upon their faces to the earth (sc., in worship), because they discovered from the miracle that it was the angel of the Lord who had appeared to them. </body></html>
