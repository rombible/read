Gideon and his men were going to fight the Midianites; could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Gideon is made to know that God could do so. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of Divine grace might come down upon himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground is wet. What cause we sinners of the Gentiles have, to bless the Lord that the dew of heavenly blessings, once confined to Israel, is now sent to all the inhabitants of the earth! Yet still the means of grace are in different measures, according to the purposes of God. In the same congregation, one man's soul is like Gideon's moistened fleece, another like the dry ground.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The threshing floors were and still are under the open air, and usually circular. The second sign <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-40.htm">Judges 6:40</a>, would be more convincing than the former, because it is the nature of fleeces to attract and retain moisture. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon&#8212;Called in this sudden emergency into the public service of his country, he was supernaturally endowed with wisdom and energy commensurate with the magnitude of the danger and the difficulties of his position. His summons to war was enthusiastically obeyed by all the neighboring tribes. On the eve of a perilous enterprise, he sought to fortify his mind with a fresh assurance of a divine call to the responsible office. The miracle of the fleece was a very remarkable one&#8212;especially, considering the copious dews that fall in his country. The divine patience and condescension were wonderfully manifested in reversing the form of the miracle. Gideon himself seems to have been conscious of incurring the displeasure of God by his hesitancy and doubts; but He bears with the infirmities of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which was more difficult and preternatural than the former instance, because if there be any moisture, such bodies as fleeces of wool are most likely to drink it up. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Gideon said unto God,.... In the same way as before, and on the morning when he had been favoured with the sight of the above miracle: <p>let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once; he was conscious to himself that it showed great presumption and boldness in him to repeat his request, and that it had the appearance of great diffidence and distrust in him, after he had been indulged with such a sign to confirm his faith; but as it was not so much on his own account as others, and promising to ask no more favours of this kind, he hoped his boldness would not be resented: <p>let me prove, l pray thee, but this once with the fleece one time more with it, and that not to try the power of God, of which he had no doubt, but the will of God, whether it was the good pleasure of God to save Israel by his hand, and whether now was the time, or another: <p>let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew; which might seem to be a greater, at least a plainer miracle than the former, and less liable to cavil and objection; for it might be urged, that a fleece of wool naturally draws in and drinks up moisture about it; wherefore that to be dry, and the ground all around it wet, would be a sure sign and evidence of the wonderful interposition of the power and providence of God, in directing the fall of the dew on the one, and not on the other. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">39</span>. <span class="ital">I will speak but this once</span>] recalls the language of Abraham in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-32.htm" title="And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.

"And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon" (&#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, clothed, i.e., descended upon him, and laid itself around him as it were like a coat of mail, or a strong equipment, so that he became invulnerable and invincible in its might: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>). Gideon then blew the trumpet, to call Israel to battle against the foe (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>); "and Abiezer let itself be summoned after him." His own family, which had recognised the deliverer of Israel in the fighter of Baal, who was safe from Baal's revenge, was the first to gather round him. Their example was followed by all Manasseh, i.e., the Manassites on the west of the Jordan (for the tribes on the east of the Jordan took no part in the war), and the neighbouring tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali on the north, which had been summoned by heralds to the battle. "They advanced to meet them:" i.e., to meet the Manassites, who were coming from the south to the battle, to make war upon the enemy in concert with them and under the guidance of Gideon. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used to denote their advance against the enemy (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>), and not in the sense of going up, since the Asherites and Naphtalites would not go up from their mountains into the plain of Jezreel, but could only go down.</body></html>
