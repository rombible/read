The existence of the same belief among the heathen is shown in the legends of Semele, Actæon, Psyche, &c.; and Callimachus sings, “Whosoever, save by God’s own choice, looks on any of the immortals, sees them only to his own great cost.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-24 Gideon was a man of a brave, active spirit, yet in obscurity through the times: he is here stirred up to undertake something great. It was very sure that the Lord was with him, when his Angel was with him. Gideon was weak in faith, which made it hard to reconcile the assurances of the presence of God with the distress to which Israel was brought. The Angel answered his objections. He told him to appear and act as Israel's deliverer, there needed no more. Bishop Hall says, While God calls Gideon valiant, he makes him so. God delights to advance the humble. Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed. Now, under the influences of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs before our eyes such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray to God, that if we have found grace in his sight, he would show us a sign in our heart, by the powerful working of his Spirit there, The Angel turned the meat into an offering made by fire; showing that he was not a man who needed meat, but the Son of God, who was to be served and honoured by sacrifice, and who in the fulness of time was to make himself a sacrifice. Hereby a sign was given to Gideon, that he had found grace in God's sight. Ever since man has by sin exposed himself to God's wrath and curse, a message from heaven has been a terror to him, as he scarcely dares to expect good tidings thence. In this world, it is very awful to have any converse with that world of spirits to which we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him. But God spoke peace to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Alas, O Lord GOD! - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-7.htm">Joshua 7:7</a>.

Gideon went in, and made ready a kid; &#8230; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot&#8212;(See on [219]Ge 18:7). The flesh seems to have been roasted, which is done by cutting it into kobab, that is, into small pieces, fixed on a skewer, and put before the fire. The broth was for immediate use; the other, brought in a hand-basket was intended to be a future supply to the traveller. The miraculous fire that consumed it and the vanishing of the stranger, not by walking, but as a spirit in the fire, filled Gideon with awe. A consciousness of demerit fills the heart of every fallen man at the thought of God, with fear of His wrath; and this feeling was increased by a belief prevalent in ancient times, that whoever saw an angel would forthwith die. The acceptance of Gideon's sacrifice betokened the acceptance of his person; but it required an express assurance of the divine blessing, given in some unknown manner, to restore his comfort and peace of mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I am an undone man; I must die, and that speedily; for that he feared, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-23.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Peace be to you; fear not: you shall not die.">Judges 6:23</a></span>, according to the common opinion in that case; of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm" title="And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, You God see me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that sees me?">Genesis 16:13</a> 32:30 <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-25.htm" title="Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.">Deu 5:25</a>,26</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For because, </span> or, <span class="ital">for therefore</span>, &c., i.e. therefore God hath showed me this sight as a presage of my death. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when Gideon perceived he was an angel of the Lord,....
