It was very sure that the Lord was with him, when his Angel was with him. Gideon was weak in faith, which made it hard to reconcile the assurances of the presence of God with the distress to which Israel was brought. The Angel answered his objections. He told him to appear and act as Israel's deliverer, there needed no more. Bishop Hall says, While God calls Gideon valiant, he makes him so. God delights to advance the humble. Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed. Now, under the influences of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs before our eyes such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray to God, that if we have found grace in his sight, he would show us a sign in our heart, by the powerful working of his Spirit there, The Angel turned the meat into an offering made by fire; showing that he was not a man who needed meat, but the Son of God, who was to be served and honoured by sacrifice, and who in the fulness of time was to make himself a sacrifice. Hereby a sign was given to Gideon, that he had found grace in God's sight. Ever since man has by sin exposed himself to God's wrath and curse, a message from heaven has been a terror to him, as he scarcely dares to expect good tidings thence. In this world, it is very awful to have any converse with that world of spirits to which we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him. But God spoke peace to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unleavened cakes - As being much more quickly baked (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-3.htm">Genesis 19:3</a>) (and as connected with the meat offering).

Gideon went in, and made ready a kid; &#8230; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot&#8212;(See on [219]Ge 18:7). The flesh seems to have been roasted, which is done by cutting it into kobab, that is, into small pieces, fixed on a skewer, and put before the fire. The broth was for immediate use; the other, brought in a hand-basket was intended to be a future supply to the traveller. The miraculous fire that consumed it and the vanishing of the stranger, not by walking, but as a spirit in the fire, filled Gideon with awe. A consciousness of demerit fills the heart of every fallen man at the thought of God, with fear of His wrath; and this feeling was increased by a belief prevalent in ancient times, that whoever saw an angel would forthwith die. The acceptance of Gideon's sacrifice betokened the acceptance of his person; but it required an express assurance of the divine blessing, given in some unknown manner, to restore his comfort and peace of mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of an ephah of flour, </span> to wit, out of the choicest part of a whole ephah; as also he brought to him the best part of a kid dressed; for a whole ephah and a whole kid had been very superfluous, and improper to provide for and set before one man. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Gideon went in,.... Into his own house, or his father's: <p>and made ready a kid; boiled it, as appears by the broth he brought, at least part of it was so dressed; and perhaps it was only some part of one that he brought, since a whole one was too much to be set before one person, and if even he himself intended to eat with him: <p>and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour; that is, probably those were made out of an ephah of flour; not that the whole ephah was made into cakes; since an omer, the tenth part of an ephah, was sufficient for one man a whole day; and, according to the computation of Waserus (n) an ephah was enough for forty five men for a whole day; unless it can be thought that this was done to show his great hospitality to a stranger, and the great respect he had for him as a messenger of God: the rather unleavened cakes were brought, because of dispatch, being soon made. Jarchi says, from hence it may be learned that it was now the time of the passover, and of waving the sheaf; but this is no sufficient proof of it; besides, if this was new wheat Gideon had been threshing, it shows it to be about the wheat harvest, which was not till Pentecost; it was the barley harvest that began at the passover: <p>the flesh he put in a basket; the flesh of the kid which was boiled, or if any part of it was dressed another way, it was put by itself in a basket for more easy and commodious carriage: <p>and he put the broth in a pot; a brazen pot, as Kimchi interprets it, in which the kid was boiled; and this, as he says, was the water it was boiled in: <p>and brought it out unto him under the oak; where he appeared, and was now waiting the return of Gideon there: <p>and presented it; set it before him, perhaps upon a table, which might be brought by his servants, or on a seat, which was placed under the oak to sit upon under its shade for pleasure. <p>(n) De Antiqu. mensuris Heb. l. 2. c. 5. sect. 9. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought <i>it</i> out unto him under the oak, and presented <i>it</i>.</span><p>(h) Of Ephah, read Ex 16:36.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">a kid</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-15.htm" title="And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.">Jdg 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-19.htm" title="So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it on a rock to the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.">Jdg 13:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-7.htm" title="And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man; and he hurried to dress it.">Genesis 18:7</a> (a calf). <span class="ital">An ephah</span> was approximately equivalent to our bushel; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm" title="And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes on the hearth.">Genesis 18:6</a> Abraham orders the same quantity, ‘three seahs’ (= one ephah, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-10.htm" title="Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.">Isaiah 5:10</a> <span class="ital">ephah</span> in LXX = <span class="greekheb">μέτρα τρία</span>). <span class="ital">Unleavened cakes</span> could be made rapidly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-24.htm" title="And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hurried, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:">1 Samuel 28:24</a>; for the <span class="ital">basket</span> and <span class="ital">pot</span> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm" title="When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:">Genesis 40:16</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm" title="And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the meat hook brought up the priest took for himself.

"And where," continued Gideon, "are all His miracles, of which our fathers have told us? ... But now Jehovah hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites." Gideon may have been reflecting, while knocking the wheat, upon the misery of his people, and the best means of delivering them from the oppression of the enemy, but without being able to think of any possibility of rescuing them. For this reason he could not understand the address of the unknown traveller, and met his promise with the actual state of things with which it was so directly at variance, namely, the crushing oppression of his people by their enemies, from which he concluded that the Lord had forsaken them and given them up to their foes.</body></html>
