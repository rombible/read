Gideon and his men were going to fight the Midianites; could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Gideon is made to know that God could do so. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of Divine grace might come down upon himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground is wet. What cause we sinners of the Gentiles have, to bless the Lord that the dew of heavenly blessings, once confined to Israel, is now sent to all the inhabitants of the earth! Yet still the means of grace are in different measures, according to the purposes of God. In the same congregation, one man's soul is like Gideon's moistened fleece, another like the dry ground.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The threshing floors were and still are under the open air, and usually circular. The second sign <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-40.htm">Judges 6:40</a>, would be more convincing than the former, because it is the nature of fleeces to attract and retain moisture. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon&#8212;Called in this sudden emergency into the public service of his country, he was supernaturally endowed with wisdom and energy commensurate with the magnitude of the danger and the difficulties of his position. His summons to war was enthusiastically obeyed by all the neighboring tribes. On the eve of a perilous enterprise, he sought to fortify his mind with a fresh assurance of a divine call to the responsible office. The miracle of the fleece was a very remarkable one&#8212;especially, considering the copious dews that fall in his country. The divine patience and condescension were wonderfully manifested in reversing the form of the miracle. Gideon himself seems to have been conscious of incurring the displeasure of God by his hesitancy and doubts; but He bears with the infirmities of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was so,.... The Lord condescended to work this miracle for the confirmation of his faith, and for the encouragement of those that were with him; the fleece was wet with the dew of heaven, and all the ground about it dry: <p>for he rose up early in the morning; being eagerly desirous of knowing whether his request would be granted, and how it would be with the fleece: <p>and thrust the fleece together; to satisfy himself whether the dew had fallen on it, and there was any moisture in it, which by being squeezed together he would more easily perceive: <p>and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water; so that it appeared it had not only fallen on it, but it had taken in a large quantity of it; the word here used is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>; the Targum calls it a flagon. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From this fact Gideon received the name of Jerubbaal, i.e., "let Baal fight (or decide," since they said, "Let Baal fight against him, for he has destroyed his altar." &#1497;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, is formed from &#1497;&#1512;&#1489;  equals  &#1497;&#1512;&#1489; or &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;. This surname very soon became an honourable title for Gideon. When, for example, it became apparent to the people that Baal could not do him any harm, Jerubbaal became a Baal-fighter, one who had fought against Baal. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>, instead of Jerubbaal we find the name Jerubbesheth, in which Besheth  equals  Bosheth is a nickname of Baal, which also occurs in other Israelitish names, e.g., in Ishbosheth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>.) for Eshbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-39.htm">1 Chronicles 9:39</a>).
