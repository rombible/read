I have adduced other instances in <span class= "ital">Language and Languages, </span>p. 232. (Longmans.)

We have two other instances of this change in the case of the sons of Saul. Whether from a faithless syncretism, or a tendency to downright apostasy, he called one of his sons Esh-baal, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“man of Baal,” and another Merib-baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/8-33.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.">1Chronicles 8:33-34</a>); but the Jews angrily and contemptuously changed these names into Ishbosheth and Mephibosheth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm" title="Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years.

And his name was Mephibosheth.">2Samuel 4:4</a>). Ewald, however, and others have conjectured that both Baal and Bosheth may, at one time, have had more harmless associations (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm" title="And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth on my enemies before me, as the breach of waters.

The LXX. write the name Hierobalos; and Eusebius (Praep. Evang. i. 9), quoting from Philo Byblius, tells us that a Gentile historian named Sanchoniatho, of Berytus, whom he praises for his accuracy in Jewish history and geography, had received assistance “from Hierombalos, the priest of the god Iao.” Some have supposed that this is an allusion to Gideon, under the name Jerubbaal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm" title="Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.">Jdg 6:32</a></span>. <span class="ital">He called his name Jerubbaal — </span>That is, <span class="ital">Let Baal plead. </span>The meaning is, either that Joash called Gideon so, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites?

Gideon must not think it enough not to worship at that altar; he must throw it down, and offer sacrifice on another. It was needful he should make peace with God, before he made war on Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great Sacrifice, no good is to be expected. God, who has all hearts in his hands, influenced Joash to appear for his son against the advocates for Baal, though he had joined formerly in the worship of Baal. Let us do our duty, and trust God with our safety.

This is explained to mean ‘Let Baal contend against him’; but the explanation will not hold good, for (<span class="ital">a</span>) if <span class="ital">Jerub-baal</span> is connected with the verb <span class="ital">rîb</span> ‘contend,’ which is questionable, the meaning must be ‘Baal contends,’ without any further thought of ‘against him’: (<span class="ital">b</span>) of course Baal did <span class="ital">not</span> contend against Gideon, the point of the story is Baal’s impotence. The explanation given in the text rests, not upon a scientific etymology, but upon an assonance, as often elsewhere in the O.T. (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm" title="And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.">Genesis 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-10.htm" title="And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son.

Originally, no doubt, the name had quite another significance, and <span class="ital">baal</span>, i.e. ‘lord,’ referred to Jehovah. In early days <span class="ital">baal</span> could be used without offence in this way; thus we find such names as Ish-baal, Merib-baal, Baal-yada in the families of Saul and David, whose loyalty to Jehovah was above suspicion; one of David’s heroes was even called Baal-jah. But the dangerous associations of the title led the prophets to discountenance this usage (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-16.htm" title="And it shall be at that day, said the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.">Hosea 2:16</a>), and it was given up; the names just mentioned were altered to Ish-bosheth (‘shame’), Mephi-bosheth, El-yada1[36]. Jerub-baal was allowed to stand, because the general drift of the present narrative (as distinct from the explanation given in this verse) suggested the interpretation ‘Adversary of Baal,’ cf. LXX. cod. A <span class="greekheb">δικαστήριον τοῦ Βάαλ</span>; nevertheless in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm" title="Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went you near the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.">2 Samuel 11:21</a> the name is changed to Jerub-besheth. If the name, then, originally had nothing to do with the Canaanite Baal, and therefore was not given to Gideon in consequence of the episode related here, we can only suppose that the story grew out of a fanciful etymology. For linguistic reasons many scholars consider that <span class="ital">Jerub-baal</span> is not connected with the verb <span class="ital">rîb</span> ‘contend2[37] ,’ and that the proper spelling is Jeru-baal, i.e. ‘Baal (Jehovah) founds,’ like Jeru-el, Jeri-yahu; none of the forms in the LXX have the doubled letter (<span class="greekheb">Ἀρβάαλ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἰαρβάλ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἰεροβάαλ</span>, etc.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[36] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/9-39.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal....">1 Chronicles 9:39-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-7.htm" title="And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-5.htm" title="Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,">1 Chronicles 12:5</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm" title="But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.

"Take the ox-bullock which belongs to thy father, and indeed the second bullock of seven years, and destroy the altar of Baal, which belongs to thy father, and throw down the asherah upon it." According to the general explanation of the first clauses, there are two oxen referred to: viz., first, his father's young bullock; and secondly, an ox of seven years old, the latter of which Gideon was to sacrifice (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>) upon the altar to be built to Jehovah, and actually did sacrifice, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-27.htm">Judges 6:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a>. But in what follows there is no further allusion to the young bullock, or the first ox of his father; so that there is a difficulty in comprehending for what purpose Gideon was to take it, or what use he was to make of it. Most commentators suppose that Gideon sacrificed both of the oxen-the young bullock as an expiatory offering for himself, his father, and all his family, and the second ox of seven years old for the deliverance of the whole nation (see Seb. Schmidt). Bertheau supposes, on the other hand, that Gideon was to make use of both oxen, or of the strength they possessed for throwing down or destroying the altar, and (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>) for removing the &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492; and the &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1510;&#1497; to the place of the new altar that was to be built, but that he was only to offer the second in sacrifice to Jehovah, because the first was probably dedicated to Baal, and therefore could not be offered to Jehovah. But these assumptions are both of them equally arbitrary, and have no support whatever from the text. If God had commanded Gideon to take two oxen, He would certainly have told him what he was to do with them both. But as there is only one bullock mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26-28</a>, we must follow Tremell. and others, who understand <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a> as meaning that Gideon was to take only one bullock, namely the young bullock of his father, and therefore regard &#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; as a more precise definition of that one bullock (vav being used in an explanatory sense, "and indeed," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7</a>, etc.). This bullock is called "the second bullock," as being the second in age among the bullocks of Joash. The reason for choosing this second of the bullocks of Joash for a burnt-offering is to be found no doubt in its age (seven years), which is mentioned here simply on account of its significance as a number, as there was no particular age prescribed in the law for a burnt-offering, that is to say, because the seven years which constituted the age of the bullock contained an inward allusion to the seven years of the Midianitish oppression. For seven years had God given Israel into the hands of the Midianites on account of their apostasy; and now, to wipe away this sin, Gideon was to take his father's bullock of seven years old, and offer it as a burnt-offering to the Lord. To this end Gideon was first of all to destroy the altar of Baal and of the asherah which his father possessed, and which, to judge from Jdg 6:28, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-29.htm">Judges 6:29</a>, was the common altar of the whole family of Abiezer in Ophrah. This altar was dedicated to Baal, but there was also upon it an asherah, an idol representing the goddess of nature, which the Canaanites worshipped; not indeed a statue of the goddess, but, as we may learn from the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, to hew down, simply a wooden pillar (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>). The altar therefore served for the two principal deities of the Canaanites (see Movers, Phnizier, i. pp. 566ff.). Jehovah could not be worshipped along with Baal. Whoever would serve the Lord must abolish the worship of Baal. The altar of Baal must be destroyed before the altar of Jehovah could be built. Gideon was to build this altar "upon the top of this stronghold," possibly upon the top of the mountain, upon which the fortress belonging to Ophrah was situated. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1492;, "with the preparation;" the meaning of this word is a subject of dispute. As &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a> with &#1489;&#1468;, to denote the materials out of which (i.e., with which) a thing is built, Stud. and Berth. suppose that maaracah refers to the materials of the altar of Baal that had been destroyed, with which Gideon was to build the altar of Jehovah. Stud. refers it to the stone foundation of the altar of Baal; Bertheau to the materials that were lying ready upon the altar of Baal for the presentation of sacrifices, more especially the pieces of wood. But this is certainly incorrect, because maaracah does not signify either building materials or pieces of wood, and the definite article attached to the word does not refer to the altar of Baal at all. The verb &#1506;&#1512;&#1498; is not only very frequently used to denote the preparation of the wood upon the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>, etc.), but is also used for the preparation of an altar for the presentation of sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-4.htm">Numbers 23:4</a>). Consequently maaracah can hardly be understood in any other way than as signifying the preparation of the altar to be built for the sacrificial act, in the sense of build the altar with the preparation required for the sacrifice. This preparation was to consist, according to what follows, in taking the wood of the asherah, that had been hewn down, as the wood for the burnt-offering to be offered to the Lord by Gideon. &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; &#1506;&#1510;&#1497; are not trees, but pieces of wood from the asherah (that was hewn down).</body></html>
