This oppression is wholly different from that with which we have been dealing in the last chapter. That was the last great attempt of the old inhabitants to recover their lost country; this is a foreign invasion.<p><span class= "bld">The dens which are in the mountains.</span>—The word <span class= "ital">mineharoth, </span>rendered <span class= "ital">dens </span>(LXX., <span class= "ital">mandrai</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>occurs here only. Rashi and Kimchi render it, “caves lighted from above,” deriving it from <span class= "ital">neharah, </span>“light” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-4.htm" title="Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine on it.">Job 3:4</a>). They were probably thinking of the subterranean galleries like those found by Wetzstein in the <span class= "ital">Hauran </span>(p. 45). R. Tanchum and others take it to mean <span class= "ital">fire-signals. </span>But the more probable derivation is <span class= "ital">nahar, “</span>a river,” and then the meaning is “torrent-gullies,” which they easily converted into places of concealment, since the limestone hills of Palestine abound in caves. Josephus understood it to mean <span class= "ital">mines </span>and <span class= "ital">caverns </span>(<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 6. § 1). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm" title="When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.">1Samuel 13:6</a> : “When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-38.htm" title="(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.">Hebrews 11:38</a> : “in dens and caves of the earth.”) Three places of hiding are mentioned: (1) The <span class= "ital">mineharoth, </span>perhaps catacombs and galleries in the rocks, which, as the article shows, were pointed out long afterwards. (2) Craggy peaks, like Rimmon, Magada, &c. (3) “Limestone caves, here first mentioned, and afterwards often used, like the Corycian cave in Greece during the Persian invasion, and the caves of the Asturias in Spain during the occupation of the Moors. It was returning to the old troglodyte habits of the Horites and Phoenicians” (Stanley, i. 340). These caves were used, long afterwards, by the brigands whom Herod and the Romans found it so hard to extirpate.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-6 Israel's sin was renewed, and Israel's troubles were repeated. Let all that sin expect to suffer. The Israelites hid themselves in dens and caves; such was the effect of a guilty conscience. Sin dispirits men. The invaders left no food for Israel, except what was taken into the caves. They prepared that for Baal with which God should have been served, now God justly sends an enemy to take it away in the season thereof.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word rendered "dens" is only found in this passage.

On the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;, the third pers. fem. sing. with &#1504;&#1492; attached, to distinguish it the more clearly from the second pers., see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-10.htm">Exodus 1:10</a>. &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, hammer or mallet of the hard workers, is a large heavy hammer. For the purpose of depicting the boldness and greatness of the deed, the words are crowded together in the second hemistich: &#1492;&#1500;&#1501;, to hammer, or smite with the hammer; &#1502;&#1495;&#1511;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., to smite in pieces, smite through; &#1502;&#1495;&#1509;, to smite or dash in pieces; &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, to pierce or bore through. The heaping up of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a> answers the same purpose. They do not "express the delight of a satisfied thirst for revenge," but simply bring out the thought that Sisera, who was for years the terror of Israel, was now struck dead with a single blow. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, at the place where he bowed, there he fell &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, overpowered and destroyed. In conclusion, the singer refers once more in the last strophe (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28-30</a>) to the mother of Sisera, as she waited impatiently for the return of her son, and foreboded his death, whilst the prudent princesses who surrounded her sought to cheer her with the prospect of a rich arrival of booty. </body></html>
