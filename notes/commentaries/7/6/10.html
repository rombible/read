As the Amorites seem to have been the highlanders of Palestine, and the most powerful of all the Canaanitish tribes, their name is sometimes used for that of all the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm" title="And if it seem evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.">Joshua 24:15</a>). Thus Heber says:—<p>“As when five monarchs led to Gibeon’s fight<p>In rude array the harnessed Amorite.”<p>No deliverance can be promised till repentance has begun. When the warnings of the prophet are heeded the mission of the deliverer begins.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-10.htm" title="And I said to you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but you have not obeyed my voice.">Jdg 6:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye have not obeyed my voice — </span>And therefore all these evils are come upon you. This is said to bring them to repentance. And our repentance is then genuine when the sinfulness of sin, as disobedience to God, is that which we chiefly lament.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:7-10 They cried to God for a deliverer, and he sent them a prophet to teach them. When God furnishes a land with faithful ministers, it is a token that he has mercy in store for it. He charges them with rebellion against the Lord; he intends to bring them to repentance. Repentance is real when the sinfulness of sin, as disobedience to God, is chiefly lamented.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A similar use of the name Amorite, instead of the more usual name Canaanite, occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-18.htm">Joshua 24:18</a>. Perhaps a special reason may be found for the use of Amorite, if the prophet was addressing those who dwelt in the mountains, where the Amorites chiefly dwelt. The idolatries of the Amorites seem, too, to have been preeminently abominable (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-11.htm">2 Kings 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-26.htm">1 Kings 21:26</a>). It should be observed that the prophet's language, as it traces the misery of Israel to their sins, so also intimates the necessity of repentance and of breaking off their sins - especially the sin of idolatry - as preliminary to any deliverance. In exact accordance with this view, Gideon commences his work by throwing down the altar of Baal, and building up the altar of Yahweh <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-24.htm">Judges 6:24-25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel&#8212;The curse of the national calamity is authoritatively traced to their infidelity as the cause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Fear not, </span> i.e. do not serve or worship them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God,  The covenant God of them and their fathers, and they ought not to have owned and acknowledged any other besides him: <p>fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; meaning not a fear of being hurt by them, but such a fear and reverence of them as to worship them, which was only to be given to the Lord. The Amorites are here put for all the Canaanites, they being a principal people among them: <p>but ye have not obeyed my voice; to cleave to him, fear and worship him; they had been guilty of idolatry, and this is the sin the prophet was sent to reprove them for, and bring them to a sense of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the Israelites had sown, the Midianites and their allies came upon them, encamped against them, and destroyed the produce of the land (the fruits of the field and soil) as far as Gaza, in the extreme south-west of the land ("till thou come," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>, etc.). As the enemy invaded the land with their camels and flocks, and on repeated occasions encamped in the valley of Jezreel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a>), they must have entered the land on the west of the Jordan by the main road which connects the countries on the east with Palestine on the west, crossing the Jordan near Beisan, and passing through the plain of Jezreel; and from this point they spread over Palestine to the sea-coast of Gaza. "They left no sustenance (in the shape of produce of the field and soil) in Israel, and neither sheep, nor oxen, nor asses. For they came on with their flocks, and their tents came like grasshoppers in multitude." The Chethibh &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be altered into &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, according to the Keri and certain Codd. If we connect &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; with the previous words, according to the Masoretic pointing, we have a simple asyndeton. It is more probable, however, that &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; belongs to what follows: "And their tents came in such numbers as grasshoppers." &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, lit. like a multitude of grasshoppers, in such abundance. "Thus they came into the land to devastate it."</body></html>
