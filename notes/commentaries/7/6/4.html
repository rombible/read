In the expression "the wisest of her princesses" (see Ges. 119, 2), the irony is very obvious, as the reality put all their wise conjectures to shame. &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, third pers. plur. fem. for &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;. The second hemistich of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-29.htm">Judges 5:29</a> contains a clause inserted as a parenthesis. &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; is adversative: "but she;" &#1488;&#1507; is only an emphatic copula; the antithesis lies in the emphatic change of subject indicated by &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, lit. to bring back her words, i.e., to repeat. &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; is used in a reflective sense, "to herself." The meaning is: But Sisera's mother did not allow herself to be quieted by the words of her wise princesses; on the contrary, she kept repeating the anxious question, Why does Sisera delay his coming? In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a> there follows the answer of the wise princesses. They imagine that Sisera has been detained by the large amount of booty which has to be divided. &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, nonne, is he not, in the sense of lively certainty. They will certainly discover rich booty, and divide it. &#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, uterus, for puella. "A girl (or indeed probably) two girls to the head of the man," i.e., for each man. &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, coloured things, cloths or clothes. &#1512;&#1511;&#1502;&#1492;, worked stuff, or garments worked in divers colours (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>), is attached without the vav cop. to &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, and is also dependent upon &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;. The closing words, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; &#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;, "for the necks," or (as the plural is also frequently used to signify a single neck, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-16.htm">Genesis 27:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-14.htm">Genesis 45:14</a>) "for the neck of the booty," do not give any appropriate sense, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; neither signifies animals taken as booty nor the taker of booty. The idea, however, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; is used for &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-4.htm">2 Samuel 12:4</a> for &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, viator, and &#1495;&#1514;&#1507; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-28.htm">Proverbs 23:28</a> for &#1495;&#1514;&#1507; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, seems inadmissible, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; ecni has just before been used three times in its literal sense. There is just the same objection to the application of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; to animals taken as booty, not to mention the fact that they would hardly have thought of having valuable clothes upon the necks of animals taken as booty. Consequently the only explanation that remains, is either to alter &#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; into &#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493; or &#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, or else to change &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1500;, the royal spouse. In the former case, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; would have to be taken as in apposition to &#1512;&#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;: a variegated cloth, two worked in divers colours for his (Sisera's) neck as booty, as the lxx have rendered it (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;). Ewald and Bertheau decide in favour of the second alteration, and defend it on the ground that &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; might easily find its way into the text as a copyist's error for &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1500;, on account of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; having been already written three times before, and that we cannot dispense with some such word as &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1500; here, since the repetition of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; three times, and the threefold use of &#1500;, evidently show that there were three different kinds of people among whom the booty was to be distributed; and also that it was only a fitting thing that Sisera should set apart one portion of the booty to adorn the neck of his wife, and that the wisest of the noble ladies, when mentioning the booty, should not forget themselves. </body></html>
