Gideon must not think it enough not to worship at that altar; he must throw it down, and offer sacrifice on another. It was needful he should make peace with God, before he made war on Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great Sacrifice, no good is to be expected. God, who has all hearts in his hands, influenced Joash to appear for his son against the advocates for Baal, though he had joined formerly in the worship of Baal. Let us do our duty, and trust God with our safety. Here is a challenge to Baal, to do either good or evil; the result convinced his worshippers of their folly, in praying to one to help them that could not avenge himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mention of the "men of the city" by the side of Gideon's "father's household" suggests the probability of their being a remnant of the Canaanite population, and the special patrons of Baal-worship. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

With the aid of ten confidential servants he demolished the one altar and raised on the appointed spot the altar of the Lord; but, for fear of opposition, the work had to be done under cover of night. A violent commotion was excited next day, and vengeance vowed against Gideon as the perpetrator. "Joash, his father, quieted the mob in a manner similar to that of the town clerk of Ephesus. It was not for them to take the matter into their own hands. The one, however, made an appeal to the magistrate; the other to the idolatrous god himself" [Chalmers].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not upon Baal’s altar, for which it was designed; but upon an altar erected in contempt of Baal. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,....

Here it is an expression of alarm, viz., fear of the death which might be the necessary consequence of his seeing God (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16-19</a>, and the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>). The expression which follows, "for to this end," serves to account for the exclamation, without there being any necessity to assume an ellipsis, and supply "that I may die." &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; is always used in this sense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-8.htm">Genesis 19:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-10.htm">Genesis 33:10</a>, etc.).</body></html>
