He was not in a condition, even had he wished it, to humble the fierce jealousy of this kindred tribe, as the more independent Jephthah, who was not so closely bound to them, did not scruple to do. He remembered that Zebah and Zalmunna were still safe; the Midianites were as yet by no means finally crushed. Patriotism as well as right feeling demanded that at such a moment there should be no civil discord.<p><span class= "bld">Is not the gleaning . . .?</span>—The answer has a proverbial sound. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-21.htm" title="When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.">Deuteronomy 24:21</a>.) It here implies that Ephraim, by a mere subsequent and secondary effort, had achieved more (as yet) than Gideon himself had done, or perhaps that the two bloody heads which were their “gleaning” were better than the “vintage” of obscure thousands. In admitting this, in waiving all self-assertion, Gideon was setting an example of the spirit which is content to suffer wrong, and to take less than its proper due (<span class= "ital">elassousthai, </span>Time. i. 77). Nor was there any irony or wilful sacrifice of truth in his remark, for there can be no doubt that the Ephraimites had wrought a splendid victory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm" title="And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a whip for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was on the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:26</a>). The Chaldee renders it, “Are not the weak of the house of Ephraim better than the strong of the house of Abiezer?”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-2.htm" title="And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?">Jdg 8:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">What have I done now? </span>&c. — What I have done in cutting off some of the common soldiers is not to be compared with your destroying their princes. I began the war, but you have finished it. Gideon here shows a noble temper of mind, which deserves admiration and imitation. Though in the midst of a most glorious victory, in which he was the chief instrument; yet, for the sake of the common good, that there might be no dissension, nor the help of the Ephraimites be wanting to distress the enemy, he receives their reproaches without anger, and even humbles himself before them, making himself of no account in comparison with them, and magnifying their service as greatly superior to his own. He disarms their insolence by his humility; their anger by his meekness; “a singular instance,” says Dr. Dodd, “of modesty and prudence in a man of Gideon’s courage.” <span class="ital">Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim — </span>What you have gleaned, or done after me; <span class="ital">better than the vintage of Abi-ezer? </span>— That is, of the Abi-ezrites, to whom he modestly ascribes the honour of the victory, and does not arrogate it to himself. It is not improbable but this might be a proverbial expression in those days, whereby it was customary to commend the smallest action of one as superior to the greatest of another. And the proverb, perhaps, was founded on fact, namely, that more grapes were usually gleaned in the large and extensive country occupied by the Ephramites, than the whole vintage of the small district belonging to Abi-ezer afforded. Be this as it will, the proverb is here applied with all the propriety imaginable, and its meaning is obvious. It is as if he had said, These scattered parties which you have gleaned and picked up at the fords of Jordan are much more considerable than those which I and my whole host have destroyed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-3 Those who will not attempt or venture any thing in the cause of God, will be the most ready to censure and quarrel with such as are of a more zealous and enterprising spirit. And those who are the most backward to difficult services, will be the most angry not to have the credit of them. Gideon stands here as a great example of self-denial; and shows us that envy is best removed by humility. The Ephraimites had given vent to their passion in very wrong freedom of speech, a certain sign of a weak cause: reason runs low when chiding flies high.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A civil war with the great tribe of Ephraim would soon have turned Israel's victory into mourning. Gideon therefore soothes their wounded pride by confessing that Ephraim had done more, though they had joined him so late in the day, than he had been able to effect in the whole campaign. The grape-gleaning of Ephraim was better than the whole vintage of Abi-ezer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3. he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?&#8212;His mild and truly modest answer breathes the spirit of a great as well as good man, who was calm, collected, and self-possessed in the midst of most exciting scenes. It succeeded in throwing oil on the troubled waters (Pr 16:1), and no wonder, for in the height of generous self-denial, it ascribes to his querulous brethren a greater share of merit and glory than belonged to himself (1Co 13:4; Php 2:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What was done was done by God’s immediate making them one to kill another; what I have done, in cutting off some of the fugitive common soldiers, is not to be compared with your exploit in destroying their princes; I began the war, but you have finished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim; </span> what you have gleaned or done after me. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of Abi-ezer</span>, i.e. of the <span class="ital">Abi-ezrites</span>, to whom he modestly communicateth the honour of the victory, and doth not arrogate it to himself, as generals commonly do. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them,....

For <span class="ital">the gleaning of the grapes</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm" title="Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, said the LORD God of Israel.">Isaiah 17:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-1.htm" title="Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the first ripe fruit.">Micah 7:1</a>; the word is used of fruit, not of corn. Ephraim indeed arrived late upon the scene, but they had the glory of capturing the chiefs. Gideon speaks only of Abiezer, his own clansmen; the 300 warriors chosen from different tribes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/7-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Gideon, The people that are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me....">Jdg 7:2-8</a>, belong to another version of the story.

Humble and unassuming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15, 36</a>, note), and indisposed to glory, he was willing to give the Ephraimites full credit for their share in the great victory; prudent, and a lover of his country, he saw the immense importance of union among themselves, and the danger of intestine divisions and discord, and so at once met Ephraim's taunts by the soft answer which turneth away wrath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The grapes</span>. The insertion of the word <span class="accented">grapes</span>, which is not in the Hebrew, rather spoils the proverb. It would run better, The gleaning of Ephraim is better than the vintage of Abi-ezer. The word <span class="accented">vintage</span> sufficiently shows that the <span class="accented">gleaning</span> meant was a gleaning of grapes. Ephraim, who came in at the end of the fight, like the gleaner when the vintage is finished, had got more glory by the capture of Oreb and Zeeb than the Manassites, who had gone through the whole campaign. The passage above referred to in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>) implies that a great slaughter of the Midianites took place at the rock of Oreb. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 8:4-12 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>According to the command which they had received (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-17.htm">Judges 7:17</a>), the other two tribes followed his example. "Then the three companies blew the trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right to blow, and cried, Sword to the Lord and Gideon! And they stood every one his place round about the camp," sc., without moving, so that the Midianites necessarily thought that there must be a numerous army advancing behind the torch-bearers. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, "and the whole army ran," i.e., there began a running hither and thither in the camp of the enemy, who had been frightened out of their night's rest by the unexpected blast of the trumpets, the noise, and the war-cry of the Israelitish warriors; "and they (the enemy) lifted up a cry (of anguish and alarm), and caused to fly" (carried off), sc., their tents (i.e., their families) and their herds, or all their possessions (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>).
