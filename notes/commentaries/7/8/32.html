No wonder if those who forget their God, forget their friends. Yet conscious of our own ingratitude to the Lord, and observing that of mankind in general, we should learn to be patient under any unkind returns we meet with for our poor services, and resolve, after the Divine example, not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abimelech's mother was not reckoned among the wives, being, probably, one of the Canaanite population in Shechem <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-28.htm">Judges 9:28</a> : neither was Abimelech himself reckoned with the 70 other sons of Jerubbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-24.htm">Judges 9:24</a>.

These verses are made up of the customary phrases of the Dtc. editor, with the addition of particulars derived from ch. 9; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-14.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.">Jdg 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm" title="And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.">Jdg 2:18</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Jdg 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.">Jdg 3:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-1.htm" title="And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.">Jdg 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-9.htm" title="And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;">Jdg 6:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm" title="And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.">Jdg 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-16.htm" title="Now therefore, if you have done truly and sincerely, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands;">Jdg 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-19.htm" title="If you then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:">Jdg 9:19</a>. Most probably, then, these verses were intended to form not an introduction to ch. 9, but a substitute for it. Ch. 9 did not fit into Rd’s scheme, so he laid it aside, and wrote <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/8-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god....">Jdg 8:33-35</a></span> to take its place. A later editor, however, thought fit to incorporate the discarded chapter, and by way of an introduction he wrote <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/8-30.htm" title="And Gideon had three score and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives....">Jdg 8:30-32</a></span>, which, as noticed above, contain several expressions found elsewhere in writings later than the Dtc. age. Budde was the first to propose this explanation, and it has been generally accepted; <span class="ital">Richt. u. Sam.</span> (1890), p. 119 ff.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This request of Gideon's was cheerfully fulfilled: "They spread out the cloth (brought for collecting the rings), and threw into it every one the ring that he had received as booty." Simlah, the upper garment, was for the most part only a large square piece of cloth. The weight of these golden rings amounted to 1700 shekels, i.e., about 50 lbs., (&#1502;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;) separate from, i.e., beside, the remaining booty, for which Gideon had not asked, and which the Israelites kept for themselves, viz., the little moons, the ear-pendants (netiphoth, lit. little drops, probably pearl-shaped ear-drops: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-19.htm">Isaiah 3:19</a>), and the purple clothes which were worn by the kings of Midian (i.e., which they had on), and also apart from the neck-bands upon the necks of their camels. Instead of the anakoth or necklaces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>), the saharonim, or little moons upon the necks of the camels, are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-21.htm">Judges 8:21</a> as the more valuable portion of these necklaces. Even at the present day the Arabs are accustomed to ornament the necks of these animals "with a band of cloth or leather, upon which small shells called cowries are strung or sewed in the form of a crescent. The sheiks add silver ornaments to these, which make a rich booty in time of war" (Wellsted, Reise, i. p. 209). The Midianitish kings had their camels ornamented with golden crescents. This abundance of golden ornaments will not surprise us, when we consider that the Arabs still carry their luxurious tastes for such things to a very great excess. Wellsted (i. p. 224) states that "the women in Omn spend considerable amounts in the purchase of silver ornaments, and their children are literally laden with them. I have sometimes counted fifteen ear-rings upon each side; and the head, breast, arms, and ankles are adorned with the same profusion." As the Midianitish army consisted of 130,000 men, of whom 15,000 only remained at the commencement of the last engagement, the Israelites may easily have collected 5000 golden rings, or even more, which might weigh 1700 shekels. </body></html>
