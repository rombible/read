The question is, were Succoth and Penuel north or south of the Jabbok? On the whole, a position S. of the river satisfies the conditions of the narratives: Penuel near the point where the road coming E. from es-Salṭ crosses the road which comes down the Jordan valley from the north (the Ghôr route), i.e. 3 miles due E. of the ford ed-Dâmiyeh; and Succoth to the W. of Penuel, and lower down in the Jordan valley, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm" title="God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.">Psalm 60:6</a>.

Zalmunna, strictly perhaps Ṣalm-na‘, appears to contain the name of the god Ṣalm, who is mentioned in the Aramaic inscriptions (fifth century b.c.) from Tçma in N. Arabia; in Assyrian also Ṣalmu, i.e. ‘the dark’ (a name of the planet Saturn) or ‘the image,’ seems to be used of a divinity1[39].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[39] See <span class="ital">NSI.</span>, p. 196 f.; <span class="ital">KAT.</span>3, p. 475 f.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Succoth</span>. On the east side of Jordan, as appears plainly from the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17, 18</a>; for we read there that Jacob journeyed from Mount Gilead to Mahanaim, thence to Penuel, and from Pe-nuel to Succoth, so called from the <span class="accented">booths</span> or tabernacles which he made for his cattle; and that after leaving Succoth he came to the city of Shechem (called Shalem)," in the land of Canaan," showing that Succoth was not in the land of Canaan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> we are also distinctly told that Succoth was in the trans-Jordanic tribe of Gad (which lay south of the Jabbok), in the valley of the Jordan, where its proximity to <span class="accented">Mahanaim</span> (vers. 26, 30) shows it to be the same place as Jacob's <span class="accented">Succoth</span>, which was also near the Jabbok (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>). The identification of Succoth with any modern representative is very uncertain. Jerome mentions a trans-Jordanic place named Soc-<span class="accented">hoth</span>, in the region of Beth-shan, or Scythe-polls; and Burkhardt also mentions a place described by him as "the ruins of Sukkot," two hours from Bysan (Beth-shan), and on the east of Jordan. But this, as well as the <span class="accented">Sakut</span> of Robinson and Van de Velde, on the west of Jordan, about ten miles south of Beth-shan, is too far north for the Suceoth of Jacob, which is shown to be the same as the Succoth of Gideon by the connection of the latter with Penuel (ver. 8), and which, as above noticed, is shown to be the same as the Succoth of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13</a>. by its proximity to Mahanaim. We must await some further light before we can decide the exact position of Succoth. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In order to cut off the retreat of the enemy who was flying to the Jordan, Gideon sent messengers into the whole of the mountains of Ephraim with this appeal to the Ephraimites, "Come down (from your mountains into the lowlands of the Jordan) to meet Midian, and take the waters from them to Bethbarah and the Jordan," sc., by taking possession of this district (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>). "The waters," mentioned before the Jordan and distinguished from it, must have been streams across which the flying foe would have to cross to reach the Jordan, namely, the different brooks and rivers, such as Wady Maleh, Fyadh, Jamel, Tubs, etc., which flowed down from the eastern side of the mountains of Ephraim into the Jordan, and ran through the Ghor to Bethbarah. The situation of Bethbarah is unknown. Even Eusebius could say nothing definite concerning the place; and the conjecture that it is the same as Bethabara, which has been regarded ever since the time of Origen as the place mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a> where John baptized, throws no light upon the subject, as the situation of Bethabara is also unknown, to say nothing of the fact that the identity of the two names is very questionable. The Ephraimites responded to this appeal and took possession of the waters mentioned, before the Midianites, who could only move slowly with their flocks and herds, were able to reach the Jordan. They then captured two of the princes of the Midianites and put them to death: one of them, Oreb, i.e., the raven, at the rock Oreb; the other, Zeeb, i.e., the wolf, at the wine-press of Zeeb. Nothing further is known about these two places. The rock of Oreb is only mentioned again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>, when the prophet alludes to this celebrated victory. So much, however, is evident from the verse before us, viz., that the Midianites were beaten by the Ephraimites at both places, and that the two princes fell there, and the places received their names from that circumstance. They were not situated in the land to the east of the Jordan, as Gesenius (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>), Rosenmller, and others infer from the fact that the Ephraimites brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon &#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>), but on the western side of the Jordan, where the Ephraimites had taken possession of the waters and the Jordan in front of the Midianites. &#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; does not mean "from the other side of the Jordan," but simply "on the other side of (beyond) the Jordan," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-32.htm">Joshua 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-7.htm">Joshua 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-15.htm">1 Kings 14:15</a>; and the statement here is not that the Ephraimites brought the heads from the other side to Gideon on the west of the river, but that they brought them to Gideon when he was in the land to the east of the Jordan. This explanation of the words is required by the context, as well as by the foregoing remark, "they pursued Midian," according to which the Ephraimites continued the pursuit of the Midianites after slaying these princes, and also by the complaint brought against Gideon by the Ephraimites, which is not mentioned till afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>.), that he had not summoned them to the war. It is true, this is given before the account of Gideon's crossing over the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>), but in order of time it did not take place till afterwards, and, as Bertheau has correctly shown, the historical sequence is somewhat anticipated. </body></html>
