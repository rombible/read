No good man can be pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God. Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod, made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, as usual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracle to be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of a good man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of the family.

The idolatrous honor paid to Gideon's ephod was probably a source of revenue to his house. Contrast the conduct of Abraham <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-21.htm">Genesis 14:21-23</a>, and of Elisha <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-26.htm">2 Kings 5:26</a>.<p>The "ear-ring" here mentioned is properly a "nose-ring" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a> note). The custom of wearing nose-rings prevails in Eastern countries to the present day. The circumstance of Job's friends each contributing a nose-ring of gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a> note) is a remarkable parallel to the incident in Gideon's history. Rings of gold were also used as money in Egypt, as appears on several early monuments, and by the Celts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-26.

As the ancient Arabians (Ishmaelites and Midianites being synonymous terms, Ge 37:25, 28) were gorgeously adorned with barbaric pearl and gold, an immense amount of such valuable booty had fallen into the hands of the Israelitish soldiers. The contribution was liberally made, and the quantity of gold given to him is estimated at &pound;3113 sterling.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Object.</span> They are called Midianites before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> Here seems to have been a mixture of people, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a></span>, which are all called by one general name, Ishmaelites, or Arabians, who used to wear earrings, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a></span>; but the greatest, and the ruling part of them, were Midianites. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,....

The Targum calls them Arabians, and who it seems used to wear earrings, as men in the eastern countries did; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>.

The request shewed Gideon’s disinterestedness and piety. As chief he would have the right to choose some gift for himself before the spoil was divided among his followers; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm" title="Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needlework, of divers colors of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?">Jdg 5:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-20.htm" title="And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.">1 Samuel 30:20</a>.

Again human weakness breaks out in this great man, and we seem to see the effect of great prosperity in stirring up selfish desires in his heart. It was perhaps not without significance that mention was made in ver. 21 of his taking the ornaments that were on the camels' necks in connection with the slaughter of the kings. Anyhow we have now a second instance of a love of spoil. It seems to have been a national custom with the Ishmaelites, among whom the Midianites are reckoned (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25-28</a>), to wear golden rings; hence when they came to strip the slain there was a vast booty of gold rings. These Gideon asked for as his share, and the people readily agreed to the request. <span class="cmt_word">Ear-rings</span>. The word is singular in Hebrew, which agrees with its more proper signification of <span class="accented">nose-ring</span>, an ornament often worn by both men and women in the East. Gesenius mentions having seen at Leipsic some Indian dancing women with nose-rings. It is distinctly marked as a nose-ring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22, 30, 47</a>, because in the last verse Abraham's servant says that he "<span class="accented">put</span> <span class="accented">the ring</span> (<span class="accented">han-nezem</span>) <span class="accented">upon her nose"</span> (<span class="accented">face</span>, A.V.). Again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a> the Hebrew is, "I <span class="accented">placed a ring upon thy nose"</span> (I put a jewel upon thy forehead, A.V.). So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a>, "<span class="accented">one</span> <span class="accented">ring of gold</span>," implies that it was a nose-ring, and not an ear-ring. In other passages, however, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>, it is expressly said that these rings were worn in the ears; while in others, again, there is nothing to mark whether they were worn in the ears or in the nose, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>, except that in the latter passage the singular number in the Hebrew is more favourable to the <span class="accented">nose-ring</span> than to the <span class="accented">ear-rings</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the A.V. translates it. It is thought by many, with some probability, that the nose-ring did not pierce the gristle of the nose, but hung down upon the nose from a fillet round the forehead. In every case they were of gold. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After punishing these cities, Gideon repaid the two kings of Midian, who had been taken prisoners, according to their doings. From the judicial proceedings instituted with regard to them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm">Judges 8:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>), we learn that these kings had put the brothers of Gideon to death, and apparently not in open fight; but they had murdered them in an unrighteous and cruel manner. And Gideon made them atone for this with their own lives, according to the strict jus talionis. &#1488;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm">Judges 8:18</a>, does not mean where? but "in what condition, of what form, were the men whom he slew at Tabor?" i.e., either in the city of Tabor or at Mount Tabor (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-22.htm">Joshua 19:22</a>). The kings replied: "As thou so they" (those men), i.e., they were all as stately as thou art, "every one like the form of kings' sons." &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, one, for every one, like &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>, or more frequently &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; alone. As the men who had been slain were Gideon's own brothers, he swore to those who had done the deed, i.e., to the two kings, "As truly as Jehovah liveth, if ye had let them live I should not have put you to death;" and then commanded his first-born son Jether to slay them, for the purpose of adding the disgrace of falling by the hand of a boy. "But the boy drew not his sword from fear, because he was yet a boy." And the kings then said to Gideon, "Rise thou and stab us, for as the man so is his strength," i.e., such strength does not belong to a boy, but to a man. Thereupon Gideon slew them, and took the little moons upon the necks of their camels as booty. "The little moons" were crescent-shaped ornaments of silver or gold, such as men and women wore upon their necks (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>), and which they also hung upon the necks of camels-a custom still prevalent in Arabia (see Schrder, de vestitu mul. hebr. pp. 39, 40, and Wellsted, Reisen in Arab. i. p. 209). </body></html>
