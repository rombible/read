And those who are the most backward to difficult services, will be the most angry not to have the credit of them. Gideon stands here as a great example of self-denial; and shows us that envy is best removed by humility. The Ephraimites had given vent to their passion in very wrong freedom of speech, a certain sign of a weak cause: reason runs low when chiding flies high.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A civil war with the great tribe of Ephraim would soon have turned Israel's victory into mourning. Gideon therefore soothes their wounded pride by confessing that Ephraim had done more, though they had joined him so late in the day, than he had been able to effect in the whole campaign. The grape-gleaning of Ephraim was better than the whole vintage of Abi-ezer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3. he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?&#8212;His mild and truly modest answer breathes the spirit of a great as well as good man, who was calm, collected, and self-possessed in the midst of most exciting scenes. It succeeded in throwing oil on the troubled waters (Pr 16:1), and no wonder, for in the height of generous self-denial, it ascribes to his querulous brethren a greater share of merit and glory than belonged to himself (1Co 13:4; Php 2:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> His soft and humble answer allayed their rage and envy.

The first clause, "and the three hundred blew the trumpets," simply resumes the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a>, "the three companies blew the trumpets," for the purpose of appending to it the further progress of the attack, and the result of the battle. Bertheau inserts in a very arbitrary manner the words, "the second time." His explanation of the next clause ("then the 300 fighting men of Gideon drew the sword at Jehovah's command, every man against his man") is still more erroneous, since it does violence to the constant usage of the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-10.htm">Zechariah 8:10</a>). "And all the camp of the Midianites fled to Beth-shittah to Zeredah, to the shore of Abel-meholah, over Tabbath." The situation of these places, which are only mentioned here, with the exception of Abel-meholah, the home of Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>), has not yet been determined. According to the Syriac, the Arabic, and some of the MSS, we should read Zeredathah instead of Zererathah, and Zeredathah is only another form for Zarthan (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-17.htm">2 Chronicles 4:17</a>). This is favoured by the situation of Zarthan in the valley of the Jordan, probably near the modern Kurn Sartabeh (see p. 35), inasmuch as in all probability Beth-shittah and Abel-meholah are to be sought for in the valley of the Jordan; and according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24</a>, the enemy fled to the Jordan. Beth-shittah, i.e., acacia-house, is not the same place as the village of Shutta mentioned by Robinson (iii. p. 219), since this village, according to Van de Velde's map, was to the north of Gilboa. For although Shutta is favoured by the circumstance, that from a very ancient time there was a road running from Jezreel along the valley, between the so-called Little Hermon (Duhy) and the mountains of Gilboa, and past Beisan to the Jordan; and the valley of Jalud, on the northern side of which Shutta was situated, may be regarded as the opening of the plain of Jezreel into the valley of the Jordan (see v. Raumer, Pal. p. 41, and Rob. iii. p. 176); and v. Raumer conjectures from this, that "the flight of the Midianites was apparently directed to Bethsean, on account of the nature of the ground," - this assumption is rendered very questionable by the fact that the flying foe did not cross the Jordan in the neighbourhood of Beisan, but much farther to the south, viz., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>, in the neighbourhood of Succoth, which was on the south side of the Nahr Zerka (Jabbok). From this we are led to conjecture, that they were not encamped in the north-eastern part of the plain of Jezreel, in the neighbourhood of Jezreel (Zerin) and Shunem (Solam), but in the south-eastern part of this plain, and that after they had been beaten there they fled southwards from Gilboa, say from the district of Ginaea (Jenin) to the Jordan. In this case we have to seek for Abel-shittah on the south-east of the mountains of Gilboa, to the north of Zeredathah (Zarthan). From this point they fled on still farther to the "shore of Abel-meholah." &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1492; does not mean boundary, but brink; here the bank of the Jordan, like &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13</a>. The bank or strand of Abel-meholah is that portion of the western bank of the Jordan or of the Ghor, above which Abel-meholah was situated. According to the Onom. (s. v. &#x391;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, Abelmaula), this place was in the Aulon (or Ghor), ten Roman miles to the south of Scythopolis (Beisan), and was called at that time &#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769; or Bethaula. According to this statement, Abel-meholah would have to be sought for near Churbet es Shuk, in the neighbourhood of the Wady Maleh (see V. de Velde, Mem. p. 280). And lastly, Tabbath must have been situated somewhere to the south of Abel-meholah. </body></html>
