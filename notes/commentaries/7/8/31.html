If so, Gideon’s conduct in making her a concubine was as much against the Mosaic law as that of Solomon, though it may have had the same colour of worldly expediency. But it is probable that the requirements of the Mosaic law were much better known in the reign of Solomon, when the priests had once more become influential, than they were in this anarchical period. This concubine exercised an influence sufficiently important to cause the preservation of her name by tradition—Drumah (Jos. <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 7, § 1).<p><span class= "bld">Whose name he called Abimelech.</span>—For “called” the margin has <span class= "ital">set. </span>The phrase is not the ordinary one, and perhaps implies that Abimelech (Father-king—“a king, my father”) was a surname given him by his father on observing his ambitious and boastful character. It seems more probable that the name was given by the Shechemites and his mother, and it may not have been without some influence for evil upon his ultimate career. The name has exactly the same significance as Padishah and Attalik, the title of the Khan of Bokhara (Gesenius). Being a well-understood dynastic title (Genesis 20; Psalms 34 title), it would be all the more significant. He was like a bad reproduction of Gideon, with the courage and energy of his father, but with none of his virtues.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/8-31.htm" title="And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech....">Jdg 8:31-32</a>. </span><span class="ital">His concubine that was in Shechem </span>— She dwelt there, and he often went thither, either to execute judgment, or upon other occasions. <span class="ital">Abimelech — </span>That is, <span class="ital">my father the king; </span>so he called him, probably to gratify his concubine, who desired it either out of pride, or design. <span class="ital">Gideon died in a good old age — </span>His long life being crowned with the continuance of honour, tranquillity, and happiness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:29-35 As soon as Gideon was dead, who kept the people to the worship of the God of Israel, they found themselves under no restraint; then they went after Baalim, and showed no kindness to the family of Gideon.

Which was not an harlot, but a secondary or half wife; such were generally taken from handmaids, and of the meaner sort, and were not in such esteem as proper wives, had not the management of household affairs, only a share in the bed, and their children did not inherit. This concubine of Gideon's seems not to have been taken into his house at all, but lived at Shechem, perhaps in her father's house, and here Gideon met with her when he went to Shechem as a judge to try causes; her name, according to Josephus (l), was Druma: <p>she also bare him a son; as his other wives did; perhaps all the children he had were sons, and this was one over and above the seventy, and not to be reckoned into that number: <p>whose name he called Abimelech: which signifies, "my father a king"; which he gave him either in memory of the offer made him to be king of Israel, or through foresight of what this son of his would be; or he might be moved to it by the mother from pride and vanity, and which name might afterwards inspire the young man to be made a king, as he was; and the account given of his name is because of the narrative of him in the following chapter. <p>(l) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 7. sect. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">his concubine that was in Shechem</span>] A connexion of this kind is illustrated by early Arabian custom: the woman, or ‘female friend’ (<span class="ital">ṣadâḳa</span>), did not leave her home, the union was of a temporary character (hence the term, <span class="ital">mot‘a</span> marriage) and required no consent from parents or guardians, the children remained with their mother and belonged to her tribe; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-1.htm" title="And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brothers, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,">Jdg 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-14.htm" title="Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.">Jdg 9:14</a>.

This is badly translated; it should he, he <span class="accented">gave him the name of Abimelech - literally</span>, <span class="accented">he set his name Abimelech.</span> There are two phrases in Hebrew. The one, he <span class="accented">called his name</span> Seth, Noah, Ishmael, Isaac, Esau, Jacob, etc., as the case may be. And this is the phrase always, though not exclusively (see, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>), used of the name given to a child at its birth or circumcision. The other is, he <span class="accented">gave</span> or <span class="accented">set him the</span> name, or, <span class="accented">he gave</span> or <span class="accented">set his name</span> so-and-so, and this phrase is only used of additional names, or surnames given later in life. The examples are Judges 13:31; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-34.htm">2 Kings 17:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-7.htm">Daniel 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>. The inference is that the name of <span class="accented">Abimelech</span>, which means <span class="accented">father of a king</span>, and was the name of the royal family of Gerar, was given to Abimelech as a significant surname, and was perhaps one of the causes which induced him to seize the kingdom. A third phrase is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-4.htm">2 Chronicles 36:4</a>: <span class="accented">he turned his name to Jehoiakim</span>; <span class="accented">changed his name to Zedekiah.</span> The Hebrew is the same in all these passages. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This request of Gideon's was cheerfully fulfilled: "They spread out the cloth (brought for collecting the rings), and threw into it every one the ring that he had received as booty." Simlah, the upper garment, was for the most part only a large square piece of cloth. The weight of these golden rings amounted to 1700 shekels, i.e., about 50 lbs., (&#1502;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;) separate from, i.e., beside, the remaining booty, for which Gideon had not asked, and which the Israelites kept for themselves, viz., the little moons, the ear-pendants (netiphoth, lit. little drops, probably pearl-shaped ear-drops: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-19.htm">Isaiah 3:19</a>), and the purple clothes which were worn by the kings of Midian (i.e., which they had on), and also apart from the neck-bands upon the necks of their camels. Instead of the anakoth or necklaces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>), the saharonim, or little moons upon the necks of the camels, are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-21.htm">Judges 8:21</a> as the more valuable portion of these necklaces. Even at the present day the Arabs are accustomed to ornament the necks of these animals "with a band of cloth or leather, upon which small shells called cowries are strung or sewed in the form of a crescent. The sheiks add silver ornaments to these, which make a rich booty in time of war" (Wellsted, Reise, i. p. 209). The Midianitish kings had their camels ornamented with golden crescents. This abundance of golden ornaments will not surprise us, when we consider that the Arabs still carry their luxurious tastes for such things to a very great excess. Wellsted (i. p. 224) states that "the women in Omn spend considerable amounts in the purchase of silver ornaments, and their children are literally laden with them. I have sometimes counted fifteen ear-rings upon each side; and the head, breast, arms, and ankles are adorned with the same profusion." As the Midianitish army consisted of 130,000 men, of whom 15,000 only remained at the commencement of the last engagement, the Israelites may easily have collected 5000 golden rings, or even more, which might weigh 1700 shekels. </body></html>
