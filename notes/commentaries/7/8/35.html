Both names may be here allusive.

No wonder if those who forget their God, forget their friends. Yet conscious of our own ingratitude to the Lord, and observing that of mankind in general, we should learn to be patient under any unkind returns we meet with for our poor services, and resolve, after the Divine example, not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Turned again - Doubtless Gideon himself had no doubt prepared the way for this apostacy by his unauthorized ephod.

It was the severest scourge ever inflicted upon Israel; and both it and the deliverance under Gideon lived for centuries in the minds of the people (Ps 83:11).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon,.... But, on the contrary, great unkindness and cruelty, slaying his seventy sons, as related in the following chapter: <p>according to all the goodness which he had showed unto Israel; in exposing his life to danger for their sake, in delivering them out of the hands of their oppressors, in administering justice to them, in protecting them in their civil and religious liberties, and leaving them in the quiet and peaceable possession of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Neither <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, <i>namely</i>, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.</span><p>(r) They were unmindful of God and unkind to him, by whom they had received so great a benefit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither showed they kindness</span>, etc. Forgetfulness of God is often the parent of ingratitude to men.

"And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and dwelt in his house." Both the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, which simply serves to bring out the fact more vividly (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>), and also the choice of the name Jerubbaal, merely serve to give greater prominence to the change, from the heat of the war against the Midianites to the quiet retirement of domestic life. Instead of accepting the crown that was offered him and remaining at the head of the nation, the celebrated Baal-fighter retired into private life again. In addition to the seventy sons of his many wives, there was a son born to him by a concubine, who lived at Shechem and is called his maid-servant in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>, and to this son he gave the name of Abimelech, i.e., king's father. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; is not the same as &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, to give a person a name, but signifies to add a name, or give a surname (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a> in the Chaldee). It follows from this, that Abimelech received this name from Gideon as a cognomen answering to his character, and therefore not at the time of his birth, but when he grew up and manifested such qualities as led to the expectation that he would be a king's father.</body></html>
