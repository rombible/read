It was a sleeveless coat of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, with two ouches of onyx on the shoulders, bound by a rich girdle. Over this was worn the splendid jewelled breastplate, the <span class= "ital">choshen, </span>with the Urim and Thummim. This ephod, with its “oracular gems,” was by far the most splendid and sacred adjunct of worship which the Israelites possessed, and hence was regarded with extreme reverence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm" title="And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.">1Samuel 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.">1Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.">1Samuel 30:7</a>), and it seems clear that Gideon’s object was to provide a counter-attraction to it in an ephod of equally precious materials. It is a mistake to suppose (as Gesenius and others do, following the Peshito and Arabic versions) that <span class= "ital">ephod </span>here means an idol or some unauthorised symbol of Jehovah, like the later “calves.” Ewald, too (<span class= "ital">Alterthümer, </span>p. 232), assumes that the <span class= "ital">“</span>ephod” was really “a gilded household idol.” But we may hope that Gideon, though guilty of a great sin, had not sunk quite so low as Jeroboam did. On the other hand, we cannot believe, with the Rabbis, that his ephod was only intended as a memorial of his victory.<p><span class= "bld">Thereof.</span>—This does not necessarily imply that he devoted the <span class= "ital">whole </span>of his mass of gold to this object. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-13.htm" title="And I will visit on her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, said the LORD.">Hosea 2:13</a>, “decking herself with earrings” is one of the signs of the “days of Baalim.” Hence, perhaps, an earring is called in Chaldee <span class= "ital">kaddisha.</span><p><span class= "bld">Put it in his city, even in Ophrah.</span>—This gives us a clue to Gideon’s motive. Shiloh, the national sanctuary, was in the precincts of the fierce tribe of Ephraim, and Gideon may have been as anxious as Jeroboam afterwards was to keep some direct hold on the nation’s worship, as one of the secrets of political power. It was the endeavour to secure and perpetuate by unworthy political expedients a power which he had received by Divine appointment.<p><span class= "bld">Went thither a whoring after it.</span>—The phrase and the metaphor are sufficiently explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.">Judges 8:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-12.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.">Judges 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm" title="And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations.">Leviticus 17:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-5.htm" title="Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit prostitution with Molech, from among their people.">Leviticus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm" title="The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to you a wife of prostitutions and children of prostitutions: for the land has committed great prostitution, departing from the LORD.">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-39.htm" title="Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.">Psalm 106:39</a>, &c. As to the nature of the schismatic service we are told nothing further. The strange narrative of Judges 18 shows us the decadence and disintegration of the national worship at this period, and it is far from improbable that Gideon may have associated his worship with an unauthorised priesthood and modes of diviuation, if not with teraphim, &c. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>). (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm" title="And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to you.">Judges 17:3</a>.) His already existing altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-24.htm" title="Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.">Judges 6:24</a>) would promote his object. It does not seem likely that the high priest at Shiloh would abandon the use of his own proper “breastplate of judgment;” but his acquiescence during this epoch of oppression would go far to invalidate his authority. If Hierombalos be meant for Jerubbaal (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm" title="Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.">Judges 6:32</a>), he is represented as having been <span class= "ital">a priest.</span><p><span class= "bld">A snare.</span>—The word used is <span class= "ital">mokesh, </span>which implies not only a stumbling-block (LXX., <span class= "ital">skandalon</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but also “a cause of ruin” (<span class= "ital">in ruinam., </span>Vulg., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm" title="And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: know you not yet that Egypt is destroyed?">Exodus 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm" title="They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me: for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.">Exodus 23:33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-27.htm" title="And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.">Jdg 8:27</a>. </span><span class="ital">Gideon made an ephod thereof — </span>Not of all of it; for then it would have been too heavy for use; but of part of it, the rest being probably employed about other things appertaining to it; which elsewhere are comprehended under the name of the ephod, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Jdg 17:5</a>. <span class="ital">Put it in his city — </span>Not as a monument of the victory, for such monuments were neither proper nor usual; but for religious use, for which alone the ephod was appointed.

No good man can be pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God. Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod, made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, as usual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracle to be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of a good man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of the family.

It seems that Gideon being now the civil ruler, desired to have an ephod of his own, kept in his own city, to he worn by the priest whenever Gideon might summon him to inquire of the Lord for him. His relations with the tribe of Ephraim probably made him unwilling to resort to Shiloh. Compare the act of Jeroboam <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, &#8230; Ophrah&#8212;That no idolatrous use was in view, nor any divisive course from Shiloh contemplated, is manifest from Jud 8:33. Gideon proposed, with the gold he received, to make an ephod for his use only as a civil magistrate or ruler, as David did (1Ch 15:27), and a magnificent pectoral or breastplate also. It would seem, from the history, that he was not blamable in making this ephod, as a civil robe or ornament merely, but that it afterward became an object to which religious ideas were attached; whereby it proved a snare, and consequently an evil, by perversion, to Gideon and his house [Taylor, Fragments].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Made an ephod thereof; not of all of it, for then it would have been too heavy for use; but of part of it, the rest being probably employed about other things agreeable and appertaining to it; which elsewhere are comprehended under the name of the ephod, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a> 18:14,18 Ho 3:4</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Put it in his city; </span> not as a monument of the victory, for such monuments were neither proper nor usual; but for religious use, for which alone the ephod was appointed.

That is, of some of this gold; for such a quantity could never have been expanded on an ephod only, even taking it not for a linen ephod, but such an one as the high priest wore, made of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, with curious work, together with a curious girdle of the same work; unless we suppose such a breastplate with it, of twelve precious stones, as Aaron had; and with little images of teraphim or cherubim in it, as Dr. Spencer thinks (i). The Jewish commentators generally understand this ephod to be made as a memorial of the great salvation God had wrought by his hands for Israel, and of the wonderful things done by him; so Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Gersom; but such a garment, whether worn by him, or hung up in some certain place, seems not so proper and pertinent to perpetuate the memory of his victories, as a monument or pillar would have been; it looks therefore more likely to be done with a religious view, which afterwards was perverted to superstitious uses; and whereas Gideon had built an altar already by the command of God, and had sacrificed upon it, he might think himself authorized as a priest, and therefore provided this ephod for himself; or however for a priest he might think of taking into his family, and so use it as an oracle to consult upon special occasions, without going to Shiloh, the Ephraimites having displeased him in their rough expostulations with him; and so R. Isaiah interprets it of a kind of divination or oracle which gave answers: <p>and put it in his city, even in Ophrah; hung it up in some proper place as a monument of his victories, as is generally thought; or in a structure built on purpose for it, to which he might resort as to an oracle: <p>and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: made an idol of it and worshipped it, and so committed spiritual fornication, which is idolatry. Some render it, "after him" (k); not after the ephod, but after Gideon; that is, after his death, so Jarchi; no ill use was made of it in Gideon's time, though he cannot be altogether excused from sin and weakness in making it; but after his death it was soon made an ill use of: <p>which thing proved a snare to Gideon and to his house; it was a snare to him if he consulted it as an oracle, which could not be without sin, since the only Urim and Thummim to be consulted were in the breastplate of the high priest at the tabernacle; and it was what led his family into idolatry, and was the ruin of it, as well as it reflected great discredit and disgrace upon so good and brave a man: some read the words (l): "to Gideon, that is, to his house"; or family; he being so good a man himself, it is not thought that he could be ensnared into idolatry itself; though it is apparent that men as wise and as good have fallen into it, as particularly Solomon. <p>(i) De leg.

It may have been a rich vestment or embroidered loin-cloth, such as we see in Egyptian paintings, which the priest put on when he consulted Jehovah; this may explain the amount of gold which Gideon devoted to its making. In the sanctuary at Nob the ephod stood or hung near the wall, but free from it; and here Gideon <span class="ital">set</span> or <span class="ital">placed</span> his ephod in the sanctuary at Ophrah.

There is great difference of opinion among commentators as to the significance of this statement. The ephod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4, 6-30</a>) was that part of the high priest's dress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>) which covered the breast in front, and the upper part of the back behind, the two parts being clasped together by two large onyx stones, one on each shoulder, and kept together by the curious girdle, just above which was fastened the breastplate of judgment. In a modified form the "linen ephod" was worn by all priests; but it was especially worn by the high priest when he inquired of God by Urim and Thummim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>). Hence it was also connected with idolatrous worship, as we see by ch. Judges 17:5, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>, being probably used for purposes of divination, as we know that idolatrous kings of Israel, instead of inquiring of the Lord, inquired of the false gods (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2, 3</a>). What, then, was Gideon's purpose in making this costly ephod? We may infer from his proved piety that at all events his intention was to do honour to the Lord, who had given him the victory. Then, as he was now at the head of the State, though he had declined the regal office, and as it was the special prerogative of the head of the State to "inquire of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2, 4</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 28:6, etc.), he may have thought it his right, as well as a matter of great importance to the people, that he should have the means ready at hand of inquiring of God. His relations with the great tribe of Ephraim may have made it inconvenient to go to Shiloh to consult the high priest there, and therefore he would have the ephod at his own city of Ophrah, just as Jephthah made Mizpeh his religious centre (ch. Judges 11:11). Whether he sent for the high priest to come to Ophrah, or whether he made use of the ministry of some other priest, we have no means of deciding. The people, however, always prone to idolatry, made an idol of the ephod, and Gideon, either because it was a source of gain or of dignity to his house, or thinking it was a means of keeping the people from Baal-worship (ver. 33), seems to have connived at it. This seems to be the explanation best supported by the little we know of the circumstances of the case. A snare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>, that which leads a person to eventual destruction. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>, where Pharaoh's servants say of Moses, <span class="accented">How long shall this man be a snare unto us?</span> See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-21.htm">1 Samuel 18:21</a>, etc. Observe in this verse how the narrative runs on far beyond the present time, to return again at ver. 28 (see note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After punishing these cities, Gideon repaid the two kings of Midian, who had been taken prisoners, according to their doings. From the judicial proceedings instituted with regard to them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm">Judges 8:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>), we learn that these kings had put the brothers of Gideon to death, and apparently not in open fight; but they had murdered them in an unrighteous and cruel manner. And Gideon made them atone for this with their own lives, according to the strict jus talionis. &#1488;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm">Judges 8:18</a>, does not mean where? but "in what condition, of what form, were the men whom he slew at Tabor?" i.e., either in the city of Tabor or at Mount Tabor (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-22.htm">Joshua 19:22</a>). The kings replied: "As thou so they" (those men), i.e., they were all as stately as thou art, "every one like the form of kings' sons." &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, one, for every one, like &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>, or more frequently &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; alone. As the men who had been slain were Gideon's own brothers, he swore to those who had done the deed, i.e., to the two kings, "As truly as Jehovah liveth, if ye had let them live I should not have put you to death;" and then commanded his first-born son Jether to slay them, for the purpose of adding the disgrace of falling by the hand of a boy. "But the boy drew not his sword from fear, because he was yet a boy." And the kings then said to Gideon, "Rise thou and stab us, for as the man so is his strength," i.e., such strength does not belong to a boy, but to a man. Thereupon Gideon slew them, and took the little moons upon the necks of their camels as booty. "The little moons" were crescent-shaped ornaments of silver or gold, such as men and women wore upon their necks (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>), and which they also hung upon the necks of camels-a custom still prevalent in Arabia (see Schrder, de vestitu mul. hebr. pp. 39, 40, and Wellsted, Reisen in Arab. i. p. 209). </body></html>
