It must be observed, that it was not unusual or disgraceful for great persons to do execution upon offenders in ancient times; no more than it was to sentence them to death: and therefore they had not, as now, public executioners; but Saul commanded such as waited on him to kill the priests; and Doeg, one of his great officers, performed that office, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/22-17.htm" title="And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me.

Little did they think to have heard of this so long after; but murder seldom goes unpunished in this life. Sins long forgotten by man, must be accounted for to God. What poor consolation in death from the hope of suffering less pain, and of dying with less disgrace than some others! yet many are more anxious on these accounts, than concerning the future judgment, and what will follow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was Gideon's place to act the part of the "avenger of blood" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>.

But it is well for us to be made aware how the best and greatest men cannot rise above the manners and received maxims of their age; and it teaches us to make due allowance for the faults of uncivilised men with whom we have to do, whether Afghans, or Zulus, or others. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Punishment of the Towns of Succoth and Pnuel, and Execution of the Captures Kings of Midian.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13-14</a><p>Gideon returned victorious from the war, &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1505; &#1502;&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "from by the ascent (or mountain road) of Hecheres," a place in front of the town of Succoth, with which we are not acquainted.
