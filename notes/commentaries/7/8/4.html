The intermediate verses are an episode, and they are only here introduced by anticipation, in order to close the notice about the tribe of Ephraim.<p><span class= "bld">And passed over.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">passing over; </span>but the English Version is correct as to the meaning, and it may be regarded as certain that Succoth was to the east of Jordan.<p><span class= "bld">Faint, yet pursuing.</span>—It may be doubted whether the usual application of these words is accurate. The LXX. render them, “fainting and hungry,” and the Vulg., “and for weariness they could not overtake the fugitives.” Literally it is, <span class= "ital">faint </span>and <span class= "ital">pursuing, </span>where the <span class= "ital">and </span>is explanatory. “Exhausted and pursuing,” <span class= "ital">1 </span>e., exhausted with pursuing (Keil). “In 1815 Mehemet All pursued the Arabs with such haste as to find himself without provisions, and had to be content with a few dates; but the result was a great success” (Ritter xii. 932).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm" title="And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.">Jdg 8:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Gideon came to Jordan and passed over </span>— Or rather, had passed over, for he went over Jordan before Oreb and Zeeb were taken; but this is not mentioned till now, that what concerned the Ephraimites might be related all together, without interruption. <span class="ital">And the three hundred men — with him — </span>Who here show the same noble spirit, fortitude, contempt of ease, and regard to what they were engaged in, which Gideon manifested; for though they were faint with hunger, and much fatigued through what they had done, yet they were eager to do still more against the enemies of their country, and therefore persisted to pursue them. Thus our spiritual warfare must be prosecuted with what strength we have, though we may have but little. This is frequently the true Christian’s case: like Gideon and his men, he is <span class="ital">faint, yet pursuing.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:4-12 Gideon's men were faint, yet pursuing; fatigued with what they had done, yet eager to do more against their enemies. It is many a time the true Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A civil war with the great tribe of Ephraim would soon have turned Israel's victory into mourning. Gideon therefore soothes their wounded pride by confessing that Ephraim had done more, though they had joined him so late in the day, than he had been able to effect in the whole campaign. The grape-gleaning of Ephraim was better than the whole vintage of Abi-ezer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

As soon as the Midianites had been put to flight, the Israelitish men of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh, let themselves be convened for the purpose of pursuing them: i.e., the men of these tribes, whom Gideon had sent away before the battle, and who were on their way home, could be summoned back again in a very short time to join in the pursuit of the flying foe. The omission of Zebulun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-35.htm">Judges 6:35</a>) is, in all probability, simply to be attributed to the brevity of the account. </body></html>
