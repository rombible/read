Naturally Zebulun and Naphtali would be more difficult to arouse than the central tribes, because, though they felt the oppression most, they would have to bear the brunt of the vengeance in case of defeat. Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm" title="Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after you, Benjamin, among your people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.">Judges 5:14</a>), being more strong and secure, could raise their contingents without the personal help of Deborah, especially if that view of the chronology be admissible which avoids other difficulties by the difficult supposition that this event took place before the death of Joshua.<p><span class= "bld">Zebulun and Naphtali.</span>—(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-18.htm" title="Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that risked their lives to the death in the high places of the field.">Judges 5:18</a>.)

Possibly it also intimates that they were all footmen, there being no horses in Judea but what were brought out of other countries.

Siser's confidence was chiefly in his chariots. But if we have ground to hope that God goes before us, we may go on with courage and cheerfulness. Be not dismayed at the difficulties thou meetest with in resisting Satan, in serving God, or suffering for him; for is not the Lord gone before thee? Follow him then fully. Barak went down, though upon the plain the iron chariots would have advantage against him: he quitted the mountain in dependence on the Divine power; for in the Lord alone is the salvation of his people, Jer 3:23. He was not deceived in his confidence. When God goes before us in our spiritual conflicts, we must bestir ourselves; and when, by his grace, he gives us some success against the enemies of our souls, we must improve it by watchfulness and resolution.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "and ten thousand men went up (to Tabor) at his feet;" i. e. as his followers ("after him," <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman&#8212;This was a prediction which Barak could not understand at the time; but the strain of it conveyed a rebuke of his unmanly fears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At his feet, </span> i.e. who followed him or his footsteps; possibly he intimates that they were all footmen, the Israelites neither now having, nor otherwise allowed to have, a multitude of horses; and so this is emphatically added, to signify by what contemptible means God overthrew Sisera’s great host, wherein there were ten thousand horses, as Josephus reports. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh,....

Deborah is called &#1504;&#1502;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; on account of her prophetic gift, like Miriam in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>, and Hulda the wife of Shallum in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>. This gift qualified her to judge the nation (the participle &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492; expresses the permanence of the act of judging), i.e., first of all to settle such disputes among the people themselves as the lower courts were unable to decide, and which ought therefore, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>, to be referred to the supreme judge of the whole nation. The palm where she sat in judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>) was called after her the Deborah-palm. The Israelites went up to her there to obtain justice. The expression "came up" is applied here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>, to the place of justice, as a spiritual height, independently of the fact that the place referred to here really stood upon an eminence. </body></html>
