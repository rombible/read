She judged Israel as God's mouth to them; correcting abuses, and redressing grievances. By God's direction, she ordered Barak to raise an army, and engage Jabin's forces. Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God's name call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it. Barak values the satisfaction of his mind, and the good success of his enterprise, more than mere honour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mark the unhesitating faith and courage of Deborah, and the rebuke to Barak's timidity, "the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman" (Jael, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-22.htm">Judges 4:22</a>). For a similar use of a weak instrument, that the excellency of the power might be of God, compare the history of Gideon and his 300, David and his sling, Shamgar and his ox-goad, Samson and the jawbone of the ass.

Barak would probably think the woman must be Deborah. The prophecy was only explained by its fulfillment. Her presence as a prophetess would give a divine sanction to Barak's attempt to raise the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali. To Barak himself it would be a pledge of her truth and sincerity. She probably commissioned some chief to raise the tribes of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a>), while she went with Barak and mustered Zebulun, Naphtali, and Issachar. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman&#8212;This was a prediction which Barak could not understand at the time; but the strain of it conveyed a rebuke of his unmanly fears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Notwithstanding the journey, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">the way</span>, i.e. the course or practice, as the <span class="ital">way</span> is taken, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-32.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:">Numbers 22:32</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A woman; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

As the Israelites fell away from the Lord again when Ehud was dead, the Lord gave them into the hand of the Canaanitish king Jabin, who oppressed them severely for twenty years with a powerful army under Sisera his general. The circumstantial clause, "when Ehud was dead," places the falling away of the Israelites from God in direct causal connection with the death of Ehud on the one hand, and the deliverance of Israel into the power of Jabin on the other, and clearly indicates that as long as Ehud lived he kept the people from idolatry (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>), and defended Israel from hostile oppressions. Joshua had already conquered one king, Jabin of Hazor, and taken his capital (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). The king referred to here, who lived more than a century later, bore the same name. The name Jabin, "the discerning," may possibly have been a standing name or title of the Canaanitish kings of Hazor, as Abimelech was of the kings of the Philistines (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>). He is called "king of Canaan," in distinction from the kings of other nations and lands, such as Moab, Mesopotamia, etc. (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>), into whose power the Lord had given up His sinful people. Hazor, once the capital of the kingdoms of northern Canaan, was situated over (above or to the north of) Lake Huleh, in the tribe of Naphtali, but has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>). Sisera, the general of Jabin, dwelt in Harosheth of the Goyim, and oppressed the Israelites most tyrannically (Mightily: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>) for twenty years with a force consisting of 900 chariots of iron (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>). The situation of Harosheth, which only occurs here (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-13.htm">Judges 4:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-16.htm">Judges 4:16</a>), is unknown; but it is certainly to be sought for in one of the larger plains of Galilee, possibly the plain of Buttauf, where Sisera was able to develop his forces, whose strength consisted chiefly in war-chariots, and to tyrannize over the land of Israel. </body></html>
