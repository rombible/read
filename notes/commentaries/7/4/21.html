To make such an assumption as a way of defending an act of assassination peculiarly terrible and peculiarly treacherous seems <span class= "ital">to </span>be to the last degree unwarrantable. If any readers choose to adopt such methods for themselves they ought not to attempt the enforcement of such “private interpretations” on others. The mind which is unsophisticated by the casuistry of exegesis will find little difficulty in arriving at a fair estimate of Jael’s conduct without resorting to dangerous and arbitrary interpolations of supposition into the simple Scripture narrative.<p><span class= "bld">Heber’s wife.</span>—This addition, being needless, might be regarded as emphatic, and as involving an element of condemnation by calling prominent attention to the “peace between Jabin and the house of Heber,” which has been mentioned where last his name occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Judges 4:17</a>). It is, however, due in all probability to the very ancient and inartificial character of the narrative.<p><span class= "bld">A nail of the tent.</span>—Probably one of the great tent-pegs used to fasten down the cords which keep the tent in its place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-19.htm" title="All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.">Exodus 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-23.htm" title="And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.">Isaiah 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm" title="Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations: spare not, lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes;">Isaiah 54:2</a>, &c). Josephus says an iron nail, but there is nothing to show whether it was of iron or of wood, and the LXX., by rendering it <span class= "ital">passalon </span>(“a wooden plug “), seem to have understood the latter.<p><span class= "bld">An hammer.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the hammer. </span>The ponderous wooden mallet kept in every tent to beat down the cord-pegs. The word is <span class= "ital">Makkebeth, </span>from which is derived the word <span class= "ital">Maccabee. </span>The warrior-priests, to whom that title was given, were the “hammers” of their enemies, and Karl received the title of <span class= "ital">Martel </span>for a similar reason.<p><span class= "bld">Went softly unto him.</span>—So as not to awake him. The description of Sisera’s murder is exceedingly graphic, but as far as the prose account of it is concerned, the silence as to any condemnation of the worst and darkest features of it by no means necessarily excludes the idea of the most complete disapproval. The method of the narrative is the same as that found in all ancient literature, and is a method wholly different from that of the moderns, which abounds in subjective reflections. Thus Homer sometimes relates an atrocity without a word of censure, and sometimes indicates disapproval by a single casual adjective.<p><span class= "bld">Smote.</span>—With more than one blow, if we take the poet’s account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm" title="She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.">Judges 5:26</a>) literally.<p>Fastened it into the ground.—Rather, <span class= "ital">it </span>(the nail) <span class= "ital">went down into the around. </span>The verb used is rendered “lighted off” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-14.htm" title="And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What will you?">Judges 1:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For he was fast asleep and weary.</span>—The versions here vary considerably, but the English version seems to be perfectly correct. The verb for “he was fast asleep” is the same as in the forcible metaphor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm" title="At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.">Psalm 76:6</a> : “The horse and chariot <span class= "ital">are cast into a deep sleep.” </span>The description of his one spasm of agony is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-27.htm" title="At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.">Judges 5:27</a>. There is no authority in the original for the gloss found in some MSS. of the LXX.: “And he was convulsed (<span class= "greekheb">ὰπηεσκάρισεν</span>) between her knees, and fainted and died.” The words here used are only meant to account for his not being awakened by the approach or preparations of Jael (Kimchi), unless they involve a passing touch of pity or disapproval. Similarly it was, when Holofernes was “filled with wine,” that Judith “approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of his head . . . and smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and she took away his head from him.” (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/13-2.htm" title="And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lying along upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.">Judith 13:2</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/13-7.htm" title="And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.">Judith 13:7-8</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/4-21.htm" title="Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary.

Thus are those disappointed who rest on the creature; like a broken reed, it not only breaks under them, but pierces them with many sorrows. The idol may quickly become a burden, Isa 46:1; what we were sick for, God can make us sick of. It is probable that Jael really intended kindness to Sisera; but by a Divine impulse she was afterwards led to consider him as the determined enemy of the Lord and of his people, and to destroy him. All our connexions with God's enemies must be broken off, if we would have the Lord for our God, and his people for our people. He that had thought to have destroyed Israel with his many iron chariots, is himself destroyed with one iron nail. Thus the weak things of the world confound the mighty. The Israelites would have prevented much mischief, if they had sooner destroyed the Canaanites, as God commanded and enabled them: but better be wise late, and buy wisdom by experience, than never be wise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If we can overlook the treachery and violence which belonged to the morals of the age and country, and bear in mind Jael's ardent sympathies with the oppressed people of God, her faith in the right of Israel to possess the land in which they were now slaves, her zeal for the glory of Yahweh as against the gods of Canaan, and the heroic courage and firmness with which she executed her deadly purpose, we shall be ready to yield to her the praise which is her due.

Then Jael took a nail of the tent&#8212;most probably one of the pins with which the tent ropes are fastened to the ground. Escape was almost impossible for Sisera. But the taking of his life by the hand of Jael was murder. It was a direct violation of all the notions of honor and friendship that are usually held sacred among pastoral people, and for which it is impossible to conceive a woman in Jael's circumstances to have had any motive, except that of gaining favor with the victors. Though predicted by Deborah [Jud 4:9], it was the result of divine foreknowledge only&#8212;not the divine appointment or sanction; and though it is praised in the song [Jud 5:24-27], the eulogy must be considered as pronounced not on the moral character of the woman and her deed, but on the public benefits which, in the overruling providence of God, would flow from it.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A nail of the tent; </span> wherewith they used to fasten the tent, which consequently was long and sharp, being headed with iron: these weapons she chooseth, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because she had no better weapons at hand, this being only the woman’s tent, where arms use not to be kept, and these people being wholly given to peace, and negligent of war, or Sisera having disarmed them before this time. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because she had more skill in the handling these than other weapons, being probably accustomed to fasten the tents herewith. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

This might seem a very bold attempt; but it must be considered that she was encouraged to it, partly, by observing that the heavens and all the elements conspired against him, as against one devoted to destruction; partly, by the fair opportunity which God’s providence put into her hands; and principally, by the secret instinct of God inciting her to it, and assuring her of success in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> What shall we judge of this act of Jael’s? It is a difficult question, and necessary to be determined, because on the one hand there seems to be gross perfidiousness, and a horrid violation of all the laws of hospitality and friendship, and of the peace which was established between Sisera and her; and on the other side, this fact of hers is applauded and commended in Deborah’s song, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-24.htm" title="Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.">Judges 5:24</a></span>, &c. And some who make it their business to pick quarrels with the Holy Scriptures, from hence take occasion to question and reject their Divine authority for this very passage, because it commends an act so contrary to all humanity, and so great a breach of faith. And whereas all the pretence of their infidelity is taken from the following song, and not from this history, wherein the fact is barely related, without any reflection upon it, there are many answers given to that argument; as, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That there was no league of friendship between Jael and Sisera, but only a cessation of acts of hostility; of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Judges 4:17</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That Deborah doth not commend Jael’s words, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-18.htm" title="And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.">Judges 4:18</a></span>, <span class="ital">Turn in, my lord; fear not</span>; in which the great strength of this objection lies; but only her action, and that artifice, that <span class="ital">he asked water</span>, <span class="ital">and she gave him milk</span>; which, if impartially examined, will be found to differ but little from that of warlike stratagems, wherein a man lays a snare for his enemy, and deceives him with pretenses of doing something which he never intends. And Sisera, though for the time he pretended to be a friend, yet was in truth a bitter and implacable enemy unto God, and all his people, and consequently to Jael herself. But these and other answers may be omitted, and this one consideration following may abundantly suffice to stop the mouths of these men. It cannot be denied that every word, or passage, or discourse which is recorded in Scripture is not divinely inspired, because some of them were uttered by the devil, and others by holy men of God, but mistaken, (the prophets themselves not always speaking by inspiration,) such as the discourse of Nathan to David, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-3.htm" title="And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for the LORD is with you.">2 Samuel 7:3</a></span>, which God presently contradicted, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-4.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,">2 Samuel 7:4</a>,5</span>, &c., and several discourses of Job’s three friends, which were so far from being divinely inspired, that they were in a great degree unsound, as God himself tells them, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-7.htm" title="And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends: for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.">Job 42:7</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</span> This being so, the worst that any malicious mind can infer from this place is, That this song, though indited by a good man or woman, was not divinely inspired, but only composed by a person piously-minded, and transported with joy for the deliverance of God’s people, but subject to mistake; who therefore, out of zeal to commend the happy instrument of so great a deliverance, might easily overlook the indirectness of the means by which it was accomplished, and commend that which should have been disliked. And if they further object, that it was composed by a prophetess, Deborah, and therefore must be divinely inspired; it may be replied, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That it is not certain what kind of prophetess Deborah was, whether extraordinary and infallible, or ordinary, and so liable to mistakes; for there were prophets of both kinds, as hath been proved above, on <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That every expression of a true and extraordinary prophet was not divinely inspired, as is evident from Nathan’s mistake above mentioned, and from Samuel’s mistake concerning Eliab, whom he thought to be the <span class="ital">Lord’s anointed</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.">1 Samuel 16:6</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a nail of the tent,.... When she perceived he was fast asleep, and it being now put into her heart to kill him, having an impulse upon her spirit, which she was persuaded, by the effect it had upon her, that it was of God; not filling her with malice and revenge, but a concern for the glory of God, the interest of religion, and the good of Israel, she took this method to effect the death of this enemy of God, and his people; having no arms in the house, for the Kenites used none, she took up an iron pin, with which her tent was fastened to the ground: <p>and took a hammer in her hand; which perhaps she knew full well how to handle, being used to drive the pins of the tents into the ground with it: <p>and went softly unto him; lest she should awake him <p>and smote the nail into his temples: as he lay on one side, these being the tenderest part of the head, from whence they have their name in the Hebrew language, and into which therefore a nail, or iron pin, might be more easily driven: <p>and fastened it into the ground; she smote the nail with such force and violence, that she drove it through both his temples into the ground on which he lay; and then, as it seems, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>; cut off his head, to make sure work of it: <p>for he was fast asleep and weary; and so heard not; when she came to him: <p>so he died; not in the field of battle, but in a tent; not by the sword, but by a nail; not by the hand of a man, but of a woman, as Deborah foretold, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-9.htm">Judges 4:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Jael Heber's wife took a <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary.
