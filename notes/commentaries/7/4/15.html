Considering the allusion to the swollen waters of the Kishon and the storm in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/5-20.htm" title="They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.">Judges 5:20-22</a>, it seems probable that Josephus is following a correct Jewish tradition when he describes the battle thus:—“They joined battle, and as the ranks closed a violent storm came on, and much rain and hail; and the wind drove the rain against the faces of the Canaanites, darkening their outlook, so that their archeries and their slings were rendered useless, and their heavy-armed soldiers, because of the cold, were unable to use their swords. But since the storm was behind the Israelites, it caused them less harm, and they further took courage from their belief in God’s assistance, so that, driving into the midst of the enemy, they killed many of them,” &c. (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 5, § 4). The battle thus closely resembled that of Timoleon against the Carthaginians at the Crimessus (Grote, xi. 246), and the English victory at Crecy, as has been graphically described by Dean Stanley (<span class= "ital">Jew. Church, </span>i. 329). We may add that similar conditions recurred in the battle of Cannæ, except that it was the storm of <span class= "ital">dust </span>and not of rain that was blown in the faces of the Romans by the <span class= "ital">Scirocco </span>(Liv. 22:46; Plut. <span class= "ital">Fab. </span>16).<p><span class= "bld">Sisera lighted down off his chariot.</span>—We find an Homeric hero, Idæus (<span class= "ital">Il. v.</span> 20), doing the same thing. On this the frivolous critic Zoilus made the objection, “Why did he not fly in his chariot?” The answer is the same as here: Sisera would have far more chance of escaping into concealment if he left the well-known chariot of a general. Besides this, his chariot—like those of the Egyptians at the Red Sea—was probably struggling in the trampled morass. <span class= "ital">“</span>It was left to rust on the banks of the Kishon, like Roderick’s on the shores of the Guadelete” (Stanley).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-16. Siser's confidence was chiefly in his chariots. But if we have ground to hope that God goes before us, we may go on with courage and cheerfulness. Be not dismayed at the difficulties thou meetest with in resisting Satan, in serving God, or suffering for him; for is not the Lord gone before thee? Follow him then fully. Barak went down, though upon the plain the iron chariots would have advantage against him: he quitted the mountain in dependence on the Divine power; for in the Lord alone is the salvation of his people, Jer 3:23. He was not deceived in his confidence. When God goes before us in our spiritual conflicts, we must bestir ourselves; and when, by his grace, he gives us some success against the enemies of our souls, we must improve it by watchfulness and resolution.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lighted down off his chariot - Probably his chariot stuck in the morass (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-7.htm">Judges 4:7</a>); or he might leave his chariot in order to mislead his pursuers, and in hope of gaining a place of safety while they were following the track of the chariot-wheels and the bulk of the host. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. the Lord discomfited Sisera&#8212;Hebrew, "threw his army into confusion"; men, horses, and chariots being intermingled in wild confusion.

Frightened them, as the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, or disturbed them with a noise and tumult, as the word signifies; with a noise in the heavens, which were in their ears, as Abarbinel observes, like the noise of a large army, as was the case of the Syrians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; and they saw, he says, horses and chariots of fire, and the like, which terrified them; and all this he supposes was done before Barak descended from the mountain, so that he had nothing to do when he came but to pursue and kill, whereby it plainly appeared it was the Lord's doing. Josephus (i) says there was a great tempest of rain and hail, and the wind blew the rain in their faces, which so blinded their eyes, that their slings and arrows were of no use to them; and they that bore armour were so benumbed, that they could not hold their swords. Something of this kind is intimated by Deborah in her song, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-20.htm">Judges 5:20</a>; and this was accompanied or followed by a slaughter <p>with the edge of the sword before Barak; the fright and dread they were put into was increased by the appearance of Barak, who fell upon them in their confusion, and cut them to pieces: <p>so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet; being very probably swift of foot; and besides thought it safest to quit his chariot, which in the confusion was in danger of being run against by others; as also he might judge he should not be so easily discerned who he was when on foot, as a common soldier, as in his splendid chariot; and this he might do in his fright, not considering his horses were swifter than he: thus Homer represents a Trojan warrior leaping out of his chariot to escape Diomedes, and another as doing the same to get clear of Achilles (k). <p>(i) Ut supra, (Antiqu. l. 5. c. 5. sect. 1.) sect. 4.

He wanted divine enthusiasm for the conflict, and this the presence of the prophetess was to infuse into both Barak and the army that was to be gathered round him. Deborah promised to accompany him, but announced to him as the punishment for this want of confidence in the success of his undertaking, that the prize of victory - namely, the defeat of the hostile general - should be taken out of his hand; for Jehovah would sell (i.e., deliver up) Sisera into the hand of a woman, viz., according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>., into the hand of Jael. She then went with him to Kedesh, where Barak summoned together Zebulun and Naphtali, i.e., the fighting men of those tribes, and went up with 10,000 men in his train ("at his feet," i.e., after him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>) to Tabor ("went up:" the expression is used here to denote the advance of an army against a place).
