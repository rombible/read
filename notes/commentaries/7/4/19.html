Saladin refuses to let Reginald of Chatillon drink in his tent, because he means to kill him.<p><span class= "bld">A bottle of milk.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the skin of milk. </span>The word “bottle” means, of course, a leathern bottle or skin. Josephus says that the milk was “already corrupted,” i.e., that it was butter-milk (<span class= "ital">Antt </span>v. 6, § 5). This is quite probable, because butter-milk (<span class= "ital">lebban</span>) is a common drink in Arab tents. When R. Tanchum adds that butter-milk inebriates, and Rashi that it produces deep sleep, and that it was her object to stupefy him, they are simply giving reins to their imagination. Josephus says, <span class= "ital">“</span>He drank so immoderately that he fell asleep.” It might have been supposed that she would naturally offer him <span class= "ital">wine; </span>but it is far from certain that even “must” or “unfermented wine”—much less fermented wine, which requires considerable art to make—would have been found in those poor tents; and, further, these Kenites may have been abstainers from wine, as their descendants the Rechabites were. ( <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-2.htm" title="Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.">Jeremiah 35:2</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 Sisera's chariots had been his pride and his confidence. Thus are those disappointed who rest on the creature; like a broken reed, it not only breaks under them, but pierces them with many sorrows. The idol may quickly become a burden, Isa 46:1; what we were sick for, God can make us sick of. It is probable that Jael really intended kindness to Sisera; but by a Divine impulse she was afterwards led to consider him as the determined enemy of the Lord and of his people, and to destroy him. All our connexions with God's enemies must be broken off, if we would have the Lord for our God, and his people for our people. He that had thought to have destroyed Israel with his many iron chariots, is himself destroyed with one iron nail. Thus the weak things of the world confound the mighty. The Israelites would have prevented much mischief, if they had sooner destroyed the Canaanites, as God commanded and enabled them: but better be wise late, and buy wisdom by experience, than never be wise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sisera went, not to Heber's tent, but to Joel's, as more secure from pursuit.

Some think he did not ask for wine, because he knew the Kenites did not drink any, and so of course kept none in their tents; but though this was the custom of the Rechabites, who were the same with the Kenites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Jeremiah 35:8</a>; yet it is very probable this custom had not yet obtained among them, since it was enjoined by Jonadab their father, who lived in the times of Jehu, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>, <p>and she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink; which she did either out of courtesy, being a better liquor, or with design to throw him into a sleep, which milk inclines to, making heavy, as all the Jewish commentators observe; though Josephus (n) has no authority to say, as he does? that the milk she gave him was bad and corrupt: <p>and covered him: again, after he had taken a draught of milk, which it seems she poured into a dish with the cream on it, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>. <p>(n) Ut supra.
