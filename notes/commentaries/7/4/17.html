The expression is probably used by anticipation. He could hardly have meant to fly to Jael rather than to Heber, until Jael came to meet him, unless there are circumstances unknown to us. Women had separate tents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm" title="And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes on the hearth.">Genesis 18:6</a>), and these were regarded as inviolably secure. He thought that there he would lie unsuspected till the pursuers passed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-67.htm" title="And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.">Genesis 24:67</a>). The name Jael means “gazelle” (like Tabitha, Dorcas), “a fit name for a Bedouin’s wife—especially for one whose family had come from the rocks of Engedi, the spring of the wild goat or chamois” (Stanley).<p><span class= "bld">For there was peace.</span>—This enabled Sisera boldly to appeal to these nomads for <span class= "ital">dakheel</span>—the sacred duty of protection. A poor strolling Bedouin tribe might well be left by Jabin to its natural independence; tribute can only be secured from Fellahîn—i.e., from settled tribes. Three days must have elapsed since the battle before it would be possible for Sisera to fly on foot from the Kishon to “the nomad’s terebinth.” It may well be conceived that the unfortunate general arrived there in miserable plight—a starving and ruined fugitive.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:17-24 Sisera's chariots had been his pride and his confidence. Thus are those disappointed who rest on the creature; like a broken reed, it not only breaks under them, but pierces them with many sorrows. The idol may quickly become a burden, Isa 46:1; what we were sick for, God can make us sick of. It is probable that Jael really intended kindness to Sisera; but by a Divine impulse she was afterwards led to consider him as the determined enemy of the Lord and of his people, and to destroy him. All our connexions with God's enemies must be broken off, if we would have the Lord for our God, and his people for our people. He that had thought to have destroyed Israel with his many iron chariots, is himself destroyed with one iron nail. Thus the weak things of the world confound the mighty. The Israelites would have prevented much mischief, if they had sooner destroyed the Canaanites, as God commanded and enabled them: but better be wise late, and buy wisdom by experience, than never be wise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sisera went, not to Heber's tent, but to Joel's, as more secure from pursuit.

Sisera fled &#8230; to the tent of Jael&#8212;According to the usages of nomadic people, the duty of receiving the stranger in the sheik's absence devolves on his wife, and the moment the stranger is admitted into his tent, his claim to be defended or concealed from his pursuers is established.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To the tent of Jael; </span> for women had their tents apart from their husbands, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-67.htm" title="And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.">Genesis 24:67</a> 31:33</span>.

The inconsistencies of the narrative can only be explained by supposing that the two stories of Jabin and Sisera have been combined by a sentence designed to harmonize them, 17b. Jael certainly belongs to the story of Sisera; it has been suggested that Heber belongs to that of Jabin. But we cannot separate Jael from Heber; it would be irregular to name a prominent Bedouin woman, living in an encampment with her family, without mentioning her husband. Probably we must separate Heber from Jabin, and suppose that the connexion between them is merely editorial; see above on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm" title="Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.">Jdg 4:11</a></span>.

And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.">Jdg 4:18</a></span> he comes upon it while he is flying, and is persuaded by Jael to <span class="ital">turn aside</span>.

He wanted divine enthusiasm for the conflict, and this the presence of the prophetess was to infuse into both Barak and the army that was to be gathered round him. Deborah promised to accompany him, but announced to him as the punishment for this want of confidence in the success of his undertaking, that the prize of victory - namely, the defeat of the hostile general - should be taken out of his hand; for Jehovah would sell (i.e., deliver up) Sisera into the hand of a woman, viz., according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>., into the hand of Jael. She then went with him to Kedesh, where Barak summoned together Zebulun and Naphtali, i.e., the fighting men of those tribes, and went up with 10,000 men in his train ("at his feet," i.e., after him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>) to Tabor ("went up:" the expression is used here to denote the advance of an army against a place).

Before the engagement with the foe is described, there follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a> a statement that Heber the Kenite had separated himself from his tribe, the children of Hobab, who led a nomad life in the desert of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), and had pitched his tents as far as the oak forest at Zaanannim (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-33.htm">Joshua 19:33</a>) near Kedesh. This is introduced because of its importance in relation to the issue of the conflict which ensued (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a> ff). &#1504;&#1508;&#1512;&#1491; with Kametz is a participle, which is used in the place of the perfect, to indicate that the separation was a permanent one. </body></html>
