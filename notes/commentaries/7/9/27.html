It was at an idolatrous feast in the house of Baal-berith, on occasion of the vintage, and when they were excited with wine, that the rebellion was matured. Those present began to "curse Abimelech," to speak insultingly of him, and to revile him (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-21.htm">2 Samuel 19:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>). Gaal, the son of Ebed, who was watching the opportunity, immediately incited them to revolt from the dominion of Abimelech, offering himself to be their captain; adding a message of defiance to Abimelech, addressed, probably, to Zebul, who was present but too weak to resent it on the spot.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-27.htm">Judges 9:27</a><p>Made merry - The word translated "merry" occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-24.htm">Leviticus 19:24</a>.
