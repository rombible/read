The Lord is known by these judgments which he executeth, when the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.

Evil pursues sinners, and sometimes overtakes them, when not only at ease, but triumphant. Though wickedness may prosper a while, it will not prosper always. The history of mankind, if truly told, would greatly resemble that of this chapter. The records of what are called splendid events present to us such contests for power. Such scenes, though praised of men, fully explain the Scripture doctrine of the deceitfulness and desperate wickedness of the human heart, the force of men's lust, and the effect of Satan's influence.

Pal. iii. p. 156, and Bibl. Res. p. 305). This town possessed a strong tower, in which men and women and all the inhabitants of the town took refuge and shut themselves in. But when Abimelech advanced to the tower and drew near to the door to set it on fire, a woman threw a millstone down upon him from the roof of the tower and smashed his skull, whereupon he called hastily to the attendant who carried his weapons to give him his death-blow with his sword, that men might not say of him "a woman slew him." &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;, the upper millstone which was turned round, lapis vector (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;: from &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, with a toneless i, possibly to distinguish it from &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; (from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;). &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, an unusual form for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, which is found in the edition of Norzi (Mantua, 1742).</body></html>
