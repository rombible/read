Evil pursues sinners, and sometimes overtakes them, when not only at ease, but triumphant. Though wickedness may prosper a while, it will not prosper always. The history of mankind, if truly told, would greatly resemble that of this chapter. The records of what are called splendid events present to us such contests for power. Such scenes, though praised of men, fully explain the Scripture doctrine of the deceitfulness and desperate wickedness of the human heart, the force of men's lust, and the effect of Satan's influence. Lord, thou has given us thy word of truth and righteousness, O pour upon us thy spirit of purity, peace, and love, and write thy holy law in our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The phrase "all" to is now obsolete, and means "quite," "entirely," as in Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>51-53. all the men and women, &#8230; gat them up to the top of the tower&#8212;The Canaanite forts were generally mountain fastnesses or keeps, and they often had a strong tower which served as a last refuge.

The besieged city&#8212;the strong tower within&#8212;the men and women crowding its battlements&#8212;the fire applied to the doors, and even the huge fragments of stone dropping from the hands of one of the garrison on the heads of the assailants, are all well represented to the life&#8212;just as they are here described in the narrative of inspired truth [Goss].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead,....

These branches they laid upon the hold, and set the hold on fire over them (the inhabitants of the tower who had taken refuge there), so that all the people of the tower of Shechem (about one thousand persons) perished, both men and women. Mount Zalmon, which is mentioned again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-15.htm">Psalm 68:15</a>, was a dark, thickly-wooded mountain near Shechem, - a kind of "Black Forest," as Luther has rendered the name.
