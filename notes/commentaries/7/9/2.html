It is by no means impossible that the Canaanites may have still held possession of the fortress, though the Israelites were nominally predominant in the town. At any rate, this particular title of “lords,” as applied to the chief people of a town, seems to have been Canaanite rather than Hebrew: the “lords” of Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm" title="And you went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.">Joshua 24:11</a>), the “lords” of Gibeah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm" title="And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.">Judges 21:5</a>), of Keilah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-11.htm" title="Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.">1Samuel 23:11</a>). The term is applied also to the Hittite Uriah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-20.htm" title="And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say to you, Why approached you so near to the city when you did fight? knew you not that they would shoot from the wall?">2Samuel 11:20</a>). What is clear is that, as in so many other towns of Palestine at this epoch (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-32.htm" title="But the Asherites dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.">Judges 1:32</a>, &c), there was a mixed population living side by side in a sort of armed neutrality, though with a mutual dislike, which might at any time break out in tumults. The Israelites held much the same position in many towns as the Normans among the English during the years after the conquest. The Israelites had the upper hand, but they were fewer in numbers, and might easily be overborne at any particular point. It must be borne in mind also that Abimelech, as a Shechemite, would more easily win the adherence of the proud and jealous Ephraimites, who disliked the <span class= "ital">hegemony </span>(see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.">Judges 8:1</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm" title="So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.">1Kings 12:16</a>) which Manasseh had acquired from the victories of Gideon. The plans of Abimelech were deep-laid. In counsel no less than in courage—though both were so grievously misdirected—he shows himself his father’s son.<p><span class= "bld">That all the sons of Jerubbaal . . . reign over you.</span>—It seems to have been the merest calumny to suggest that they ever dreamt of making their father’s influence hereditary in this sense. Gideon had expressly repudiated all wish and claim to exercise “rule” (<span class= "ital">meshol, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-23.htm" title="And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.">Judges 8:23</a>) of this kind. The remark of Abimelech is quite in the ancient spirit—<p><span class= "greekheb">οὐκ άγαθὸν πολυκοίρανίη</span>, εἶς κοιρανὸς ε̄̌<span class= "greekheb">στω</span>.<p>(Comp. Eur. <span class= "ital">Suppl. </span>410.)<p><span class= "bld">Your bone and your flesh.</span>—The same phrase is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-14.htm" title="And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him the space of a month.">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm" title="Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.">2Samuel 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-12.htm" title="You are my brothers, you are my bones and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?">2Samuel 19:12</a>. He was akin to both the elements of the population: to the Ephraimites, from the place of his birth, or at any rate of his mother’s residence; and to the Canaanites (as the whole narrative implies), from her blood. The plea was “like that of our Henry II., the first Norman son of a Saxon mother” (Stanley).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 The men of Shechem chose Abimelech king.

Which, though the Targum calls the inhabitants of the place, Ben Melech better interprets it the lords of Shechem, as the phrase will bear to be rendered; for it is more likely he would have this first whispered and suggested to the principal men of the city, before the common people were acquainted with it, and indeed in order to use their influence with them: <p>whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are seventy persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? intimating thereby, that though Gideon his father had refused the regal government when offered him, it was but reasonable that his sons, or some one of them, should be tried, whether it would be acceptable to them; nay, he would insinuate, that the sons of Gideon, who were seventy in number, were either contending with one another about it, or contriving to divide the government among them, and therefore desired it might be moved to consideration, whether it would not be more eligible to fix upon some one person to be their ruler, than to be under the government of seventy; or, in other words, whether it was not better to have one king than seventy kings; but in reality there was no necessity for any consultation about this matter, the sons of judges never succeeded their fathers in government; nor does it appear that any of Gideon's sons had any thought about it, nor any desire to be made kings, as appears from Jotham's parable; and this was only a wicked insinuation of this man's, with an ambitious view of getting the kingdom to himself, as follows: <p>remember also that I am your bone and your flesh; was of the same tribe and city with them, born among them, his mother always living with them, and he having now many near relations by his mother's side that dwelt there; and therefore while they had this affair of government under consideration, he would have them think of him to be their king, which would be to their honour, and to their advantage, to have one so nearly related to them on the throne, from whom they might expect many favours. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether <i>is</i> better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, <i>which are</i> threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I <i>am</i> your <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> bone and your flesh.</span><p>(b) Of your kindred by my mother's side.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the men of Shechem</span>] lit. <span class="ital">possessors</span> (plur. of <span class="ital">ba‘al</span>) i.e. <span class="ital">citizens</span> of S.; so throughout this chap., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-5.htm" title="And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about on me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.">Jdg 20:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-11.htm" title="Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?

But we need not think of 70 men literally ‘ruling’; Abimelech wanted to put the case in the worst light possible. If his mother had been a <span class="ital">ṣadâḳa</span> wife (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-31.htm" title="And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.">Jdg 8:31</a>), the children would have belonged to her clan and not the father’s; this would make the appeal to ‘bone and flesh’ all the stronger, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-14.htm" title="And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh.

"And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and dwelt in his house." Both the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, which simply serves to bring out the fact more vividly (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>), and also the choice of the name Jerubbaal, merely serve to give greater prominence to the change, from the heat of the war against the Midianites to the quiet retirement of domestic life. Instead of accepting the crown that was offered him and remaining at the head of the nation, the celebrated Baal-fighter retired into private life again. In addition to the seventy sons of his many wives, there was a son born to him by a concubine, who lived at Shechem and is called his maid-servant in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>, and to this son he gave the name of Abimelech, i.e., king's father. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; is not the same as &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, to give a person a name, but signifies to add a name, or give a surname (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a> in the Chaldee). It follows from this, that Abimelech received this name from Gideon as a cognomen answering to his character, and therefore not at the time of his birth, but when he grew up and manifested such qualities as led to the expectation that he would be a king's father.</body></html>
