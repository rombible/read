When God uses men as instruments in his hand to do his work, he means one thing, and they another. That, which they hoped would have been for their welfare, proved a snare and a trap, as those will certainly find, who run to idols for shelter; such will prove a refuge of lies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Zalmon - A lofty and thickly-wooded hill, as the etymology of the name ("shady") implies, in the immediate neighborhood of Shechem: perhaps the same as Ebal.

Jarchi says it was a wood or forest, where they bent the trees, and divided them round about, and made a fence of them; but they would scarcely have left the tower for such a shelter: <p>so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also; fire being put to the hold, and they burnt in it; the Vulgate Latin version adds, with fire and smoke; for they being boughs of trees just cut down, with which they set fire to the hold, they would not burn easily and clearly, but make a prodigious smoke, with which many might be suffocated, as others burnt with fire; and it is unaccountable that Josephus (o) should say that faggots of dry wood were taken, and with them fire set to the hold, when the text is so express for it that they were boughs of green trees just cut off: <p>about a thousand men and women; but the above historian makes them to be many more; he says the men were about 1500, and the rest a great multitude; this literally fulfilled Jotham's curse. <p>(o) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 7. sect. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put <i>them</i> to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> died also, about a thousand men and women.</span><p>(q) Meaning, that all were destroyed as well as those in the tower.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">49</span>. <span class="ital">upon them</span>] See <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm" title="And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.">Jdg 9:46</a></span> <span class="ital">n.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set the hold on fire</span> - thus literally fulfilling Jotham's curse in vers. 15 and 20.
