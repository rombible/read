These verses form a long period, the first half of which is so extended by the insertion of parentheses introduced as explanations (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-17.htm">Judges 9:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>), that the commencement of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-16.htm">Judges 9:16</a>) is taken up again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a> for the purpose of attaching the apodosis. "If ye have acted in truth and sincerity, and (i.e., when he) made Abimelech king; if ye have done well to Jerubbaal and his house, and if ye have done to him according to the doing of his hands ... as my father fought for you ... but ye have risen up to-day against my father's house, and have slain ... if (I say) ye have acted in truth and sincerity to Jerubbaal and his house this day: then rejoice in Abimelech ...." &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, to throw away his life, i.e., expose to death. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, "from before him," serves to strengthen the &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;. Jotham imputes the slaying of his brothers to the citizens of Shechem, as a crime which they themselves had committed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>), because they had given Abimelech money out of their temple of Baal to carry out his designs against the sons of Jerubbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>). In this reproach he had, strictly speaking, already pronounced sentence upon their doings. When, therefore, he proceeds still further in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a>, "If ye have acted in truth towards Jerubbaal ... then rejoice," etc., this turn contains the bitterest scorn at the faithlessness manifested towards Jerubbaal. In that case nothing could follow but the fulfilment of the threat and the bursting forth of the fire. In carrying out this point the application goes beyond the actual meaning of the parable itself. Not only will fire go forth from Abimelech and consume the lords of Shechem and the inhabitants of Millo, but fire will also go forth from them and devour Abimelech himself. The fulfilment of this threat was not long delayed, as the following history shows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23</a>.). </body></html>
