(Comp. Pope, <span class= "ital">Epistle to Arbuthnot: </span>“Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne.”) There is little affection and much jealousy in polygamous households. Abimelech by this vile wickedness set a fatal precedent, which was followed again and again in the kingdom of Israel by Baasha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:">1Kings 15:29</a>), Zimri (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that urinates against a wall, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.">1Kings 16:11</a>), Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-7.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.">2Kings 10:7</a>), and probably by other kings (2 Kings 15); and by Athaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-1.htm" title="And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.">2Kings 11:1</a>) in <span class= "ital">the </span>kingdom of Judah. Herod also put to death most of his kinsmen, and some of his sons (see <span class= "ital">Life of Christ, </span>i. 43).

Here we see the power of ambition; what savage beasts it will render men to each other; how it will break through all the ties of natural affection, and natural conscience, and sacrifice that which is most sacred, dear, and valuable to its designs. We see also the peril attending high birth and honour. It was their being the sons of so great a man as Gideon that made Abimelech jealous of them, and exposed them thus to danger and to death. We find just the same number of Ahab’s sons slain together at Samaria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-1.htm" title="And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.

Abimelech slew his brethren on one stone, either by dashing them from one rock, or sacrificing them on one stone altar, in revenge for the demolition of Baal's altar by their father.
