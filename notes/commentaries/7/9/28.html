It can hardly be a <span class= "ital">contrast </span>between the insignificance of Abimelech and the grandeur of Shechem (Vulg., <span class= "ital">quœ est Shechem?</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Some say that “Shechem” means “Abimelech;” but there is no trace of kings assuming the name of the place over which they rule, nor does the LXX. mend matters much by interpolating the words, “who is <span class= "ital">the son of </span>Shechem?”<p><span class= "bld">The son of Jerubbaal?</span>—And, therefore, on the father’s side, disconnected both with Ephraimites and Canaanites; and the Baal-fighter’s son has no claim on Baal-worshippers.<p><span class= "bld">And Zebul his officer?</span>—We are not even under the rule of Abimelech, but of his underling.<p><span class= "bld">Serve the men of Hamor.</span>—Here the LXX., Vulg., and other versions adopt a different punctuation and a different reading. But there is no reason to alter the text.

Genesis 34); are <span class="ital">we</span>, the freemen of Shechem, to become the servants of this usurping half-breed?’ The emphasis is on <span class="ital">we</span>, in antithesis to ‘the son of J.’ etc.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Gaal</span>, etc. Gaal now saw his opportunity, and encouraged the revolt. <span class="cmt_word">Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?</span> The meaning of these words, though somewhat obscure at first, becomes plain if we compare the two similar passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>. In the first we have the contemptuous question, "Who is David?" and in the second the analogous one, "What portion have we in David?" but in both we have the same person described by different terms: "Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse?" and, "What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse." Here, therefore, it is clear that <span class="accented">Shechem</span> is merely another name for <span class="accented">Abimelech</span>; and it is easy to see why. Abimelech's mother was a Canaanite bond-woman, a Shechemite; and the plea for making Abimelech king was, "for he is our brother" (vers. 2, 3). <span class="accented">Shechem</span>, or <span class="accented">the son of Shechem</span>, was therefore a natural description of Abimelech. But, adds Gaal, <span class="cmt_word">is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and</span> (is not) <span class="cmt_word">Zebul his officer?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is not a real Shechemite; he is the son of Jerubbaal; and what right has he to reign over you Shechemites? And why should Zebul lord it over you? He is only Abimelech's officer, <span class="cmt_word">No; serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem</span>. Fling off the yoke of the Abi-ezrite stranger, and set up a real Canaanite government from the old race of Hamor, the true founder and head of Shechem (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50-52</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Abimelech's reign lasted three years. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; to govern, is used intentionally, as it appears, in the place of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, because Abimelech's government was not a monarchical reign, but simply a tyrannical despotism. "Over Israel," that is to say, not over the whole of the twelve tribes of Israel, but only over a portion of the nation, possibly the tribes of Ephraim and half Manasseh, which acknowledged his sway.</body></html>
