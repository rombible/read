The general bearing of this graphic episode is to illustrate the slow, but certain, working of Divine retribution. The two main faults of the last phase of Gideon’s career had been his polygamy and his dangerous tampering with unauthorised, if not idolatrous, worship. The retribution for both errors falls on his house. The agents of their overthrow are the kinsmen of his base-born son by a Canaanite mother. Abimelech seems to have taken his first steps very soon after Gideon’s death. Doubtless he had long been secretly maturing his plans. The narrative bears on its surface inimitable marks of truthfulness. We can trace in the character of Abimelech a reflection of his father’s courage and promptitude, overshadowed by elements which he must have drawn from his maternal origin.<p><span class= "bld">Unto his mother’s brethren.</span>—His Canaanite kith and kin, who doubtless had great influence over the still powerful aboriginal element of the Shechemite population.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/9-1.htm" title="And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brothers, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,...">Jdg 9:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Abimelech went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren — </span>That is, her relations; <span class="ital">and communed with them — </span>To try if he could engage them to favour and aid the design he had conceived to usurp the government of Israel, in direct opposition to his father’s will, who had declared <span class="ital">no son of his should rule over them. </span>His mother had, probably, instilled into his mind some ambitious thoughts, and the name his father had given him, carrying royalty in its meaning, might help to blow up these sparks, and excite him to take the steps here mentioned. He had no call from God to this office and honour, as his father had, nor was there any present occasion for a judge to deliver Israel, as there was when his father was advanced; but his own ambition must be gratified, and that is all he aims at. <span class="ital">That all the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you — </span>He wickedly insinuates, though perhaps without any ground for it, that the sons of Jerubbaal were ambitious of the kingdom which their father refused; and therefore prays them to consider what horrible divisions and confusions it would make, if so many were permitted to pretend to the government, and how much better it would be to choose one from among the rest; pointing them (in the next words) to himself. <span class="ital">Remember, I am your bone and your flesh — </span>Your kinsman, of the same tribe and city with you; which will be no small honour and advantage to you. Shechem was a city in the tribe of Ephraim, of great note. Joshua had held his last great meeting of the representatives of the tribes there. And no doubt Abimelech thought if that city would but declare for him, and abet his design, it would be a great step toward ensuring the success of it. <span class="ital">They said, He is our brother — </span>And his advancement will be to our advantage. They were pleased to think of their city becoming a royal city, and the metropolis of Israel, and therefore were easily persuaded to what they believed would serve their interest.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 The men of Shechem chose Abimelech king.

Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem&#8212;The idolatry which had been stealthily creeping into Israel during the latter years of Gideon was now openly professed; Shechem was wholly inhabited by its adherents; at least, idolaters had the ascendency.

Throughout this chapter Gideon is spoken of by the name of Jerubbaal. There must be some cause for this. The simplest and most probable cause is that this whole history of Abimelech is taken from some other source than the preceding chapters. And a considerable difference in the style of the narrative, which is feebler and more obscure, seems to bear out this inference. <span class="cmt_word">Went to Shechem</span>. This revolt from the house of Gideon in favour of Abimelech seems to partake of the nature of an Ephraimite rising against the supremacy of Manasseh. It was doubtless galling to the pride of the great tribe of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1-6</a>) that Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites should be the seat of government, and Gideon's ephod the centre of religion for the tribes of Israel. And so they seem to have taken advantage of Gideon's death, and of Abimelech's connection with Shechem, to make a league with the Hivite inhabitants of Shechem (see vers. 27, 28) to set up Abimelech as king, and to restore the worship of Baal, under the title of Baal-berith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4, 27, 46</a>), at Shechem for all Israel to resort to. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before the account of his death, a few other notices respecting his family are introduced for the purpose of preparing the way for the following history of the doings of his sons, in which the sin of Gideon came to a head, and the judgment burst upon his house. "And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and dwelt in his house." Both the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, which simply serves to bring out the fact more vividly (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>), and also the choice of the name Jerubbaal, merely serve to give greater prominence to the change, from the heat of the war against the Midianites to the quiet retirement of domestic life. Instead of accepting the crown that was offered him and remaining at the head of the nation, the celebrated Baal-fighter retired into private life again. In addition to the seventy sons of his many wives, there was a son born to him by a concubine, who lived at Shechem and is called his maid-servant in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>, and to this son he gave the name of Abimelech, i.e., king's father. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; is not the same as &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, to give a person a name, but signifies to add a name, or give a surname (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a> in the Chaldee). It follows from this, that Abimelech received this name from Gideon as a cognomen answering to his character, and therefore not at the time of his birth, but when he grew up and manifested such qualities as led to the expectation that he would be a king's father.</body></html>
