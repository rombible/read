When God uses men as instruments in his hand to do his work, he means one thing, and they another. That, which they hoped would have been for their welfare, proved a snare and a trap, as those will certainly find, who run to idols for shelter; such will prove a refuge of lies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shechem is another designation of Abimelech.

"An evil spirit" is not merely "an evil disposition," but an evil demon, which produced discord and strife, just as an evil spirit came upon Saul (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>); not Satan himself, but a supernatural spiritual power which was under his influence. This evil spirit God sent to punish the wickedness of Abimelech and the Shechemites. Elohim, not Jehovah, because the working of the divine justice is referred to here. "That the wickedness to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood (the blood of these sons that had been shed), to lay it upon Abimelech. " "And their blood" is only a more precise definition of "the wickedness to the seventy sons;" and "to lay it" is an explanation of the expression "might come." The introduction of &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, however, brings an anakolouthon into the construction, since the transitive &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; presupposes Elohim as the subject and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501; as the object, whereas the parallel &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; is the subject to the intransitive &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;: that the wickedness might come, and that God might lay the blood not only upon Abimelech, the author of the crime, but also upon the lords of Shechem, who had strengthened his hands to slay his brethren; had supported him by money, that he might be able to hire worthless fellows to execute his crime (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>). </body></html>
