In a parable or fiction, every word or sentence is not to be interpreted with the utmost rigour, unless we are to take it to be Scripture doctrine that trees could talk. Jotham, to represent the forwardness and self-assurance of foolish persons in undertaking high things, which wiser and better men would decline, brings in a fable, setting forth how the <span class="ital">olive- tree, </span>the <span class="ital">fig-tree, </span>and the <span class="ital">vine, </span>and all the choice trees, had modestly refused a province not proper for them; but that the bramble, the unfittest of all, had accepted it notwithstanding, and was likely to perform accordingly. Now the words here cited arc the words of the vine, and perhaps run upon a pagan hypothesis, allowable in a fable or apologue. So Castalio, Le Clerc, and others, interpret the place; and they render the words, not <span class="ital">God and man, </span>but <span class="ital">gods and men, </span>which is better.” There is another construction which some have recommended, namely, that wine cheereth both high and low, <span class="ital">princes </span>(who are sometimes called <span class="ital">elohim, gods</span>) <span class="ital">and peasants. </span>“But I prefer the interpretation of Le Clerc above mentioned,” says Dr. Waterland, <span class="ital">Scrip. Vind., </span>p. 80. And his interpretation is confirmed by the following ingenious remark of Bishop Warburton: — “Jotham did not mean God the governor of the universe; but all must see his meaning is, that <span class="ital">wine cheereth hero-gods </span>and <span class="ital">common men; </span>for Jotham is here speaking to an idolatrous city, which <span class="ital">ran a whoring after Baalim, </span>and made Baal-berith their god; a god sprung from among men, as may partly be collected from his name, as well as from divers other circumstances of the story. This expression, which is very beautiful, contains one of the finest strokes of ridicule in the whole apologue, so much abounding with them; and intimates to the Shechemites the vanity and pitiful original of their idolatrous gods, who were thought to be, or really had been, <span class="ital">refreshed with wine.” Div.

Nor was there any occasion for Israel to set a king over them, for the Lord was their King. Those who bear fruit for the public good, are justly respected and honoured by all that are wise, more than those who merely make a figure. All these fruit-trees gave much the same reason for their refusal to be promoted over the trees; or, as the margin reads it, to go up and down for the trees. To rule, involves a man in a great deal both of toil and care. Those who are preferred to public trust and power, must forego all private interests and advantages, for the good of others. And those advanced to honour and dignity, are in great danger of losing their fruitfulness. For which reason, they that desire to do good, are afraid of being too great. Jotham compares Abimelech to the bramble or thistle, a worthless plant, whose end is to be burned.

The wine is said to cheer, or make to rejoice, God because the drink offering which accompanied the meat offering consisted of wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-7.htm">Numbers 15:7, 10</a>), and God was well pleased with the offerings of his people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>). The idea in this verse, as in vers. 9 and 11, is, that while the olive, the fig, and the vine were occupied in <span class="accented">waving</span> their branches over the other trees, in token of their superiority, they would necessarily be neglecting., their own proper gift and office, which was to produce oil, and figs, and grapes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Jotham, who had escaped after the murder, was told of the election which had taken place, he went to the top of Mount Gerizim, which rises as a steep wall of rock to the height of about 800 feet above the valley of Shechem on the south side of the city (Rob. iii. p. 96), and cried with a loud voice, "Hearken to me, ye lords of Shechem, and God will also hearken to you." After this appeal, which calls to mind the language of the prophets, he uttered aloud a fable of the trees which wanted to anoint a king over them-a fable of true prophetic significance, and the earliest with which we are acquainted (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8-15</a>). To the appeal which is made to them in succession to become king over the trees, the olive tree, the fig tree, and the vine all reply: Shall we give up our calling, to bear valuable fruits for the good and enjoyment of God and men, and soar above the other trees? The briar, however, to which the trees turn last of all, is delighted at the unexpected honour that is offered it, and says, "Will ye in truth anoint me king over you? Then come and trust in my shadow; but if not, let fire go out of the briar and consume the cedars of Lebanon." The rare form &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1499;&#1492; (Chethib, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-12.htm">Judges 9:12</a>) also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-8.htm">1 Samuel 28:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-11.htm">Isaiah 32:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a> : see Ewald, 228, b.). &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-10.htm">Judges 9:10</a>) is also rare (see Ewald, 226, b). The form &#1492;&#1495;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-11.htm">Judges 9:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>), which is quite unique, is not "Hophal or Hiphil, compounded of &#1492;&#1492;&#1495;&#1491; or &#1492;&#1492;&#1495;&#1491;" (Ewald, 51, c), for neither the Hophal nor the Hiphil of &#1495;&#1491;&#1500; occurs anywhere else; but it is a simple Kal, and the obscure o sound is chosen instead of the a sound for the sake of euphony, i.e., to assist the pronunciation of the guttural syllables which follow one after another. The meaning of the fable is very easy to understand. The olive tree, fig tree, and vine do not represent different historical persons, such as the judges Othniel, Deborah, and Gideon, as the Rabbins affirm, but in a perfectly general way the nobler families or persons who bring forth fruit and blessing in the calling appointed them by God, and promote the prosperity of the people and kingdom in a manner that is well-pleasing to God and men. Oil, figs, and wine were the most valuable productions of the land of Canaan, whereas the briar was good for nothing but to burn. The noble fruit-trees would not tear themselves from the soil in which they had been planted and had borne fruit, to soar (&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, float about) above the trees, i.e., not merely to rule over the trees, but obire et circumagi in rebus eorum curandis. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; includes the idea of restlessness and insecurity of existence. The explanation given in the Berleb. Bible, "We have here what it is to be a king, to reign or be lord over many others, namely, very frequently to do nothing else than float about in such restlessness and distraction of thoughts, feelings, and desires, that very little good or sweet fruit ever falls to the ground," if not a truth without exception so far as royalty is concerned, is at all events perfectly true in relation to what Abimelech aimed at and attained, to be a king by the will of the people and not by the grace of God. Wherever the Lord does not found the monarchy, or the king himself does not lay the foundations of his government in God and the grace of God, he is never anything but a tree, moving about above other trees without a firm root in a fruitful soil, utterly unable to bear fruit to the glory of God and the good of men. The expression "all the trees" is to be carefully noticed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-14.htm">Judges 9:14</a>. "All the trees" say to the briar, Be king over us, whereas in the previous verse only "the trees" are mentioned. This implies that of all the trees not one was willing to be king himself, but that they were unanimous in transferring the honour to the briar. The briar, which has nothing but thorns upon it, and does not even cast sufficient shadow for any one to lie down in its shadow and protect himself from the burning heat of the sun, is an admirable simile for a worthless man, who can do nothing but harm. The words of the briar, "Trust in my shadow," seek refuge there, contain a deep irony, the truth of which the Shechemites were very soon to discover. "And if not," i.e., if ye do not find the protection you expect, fire will go out of the briar and consume the cedars of Lebanon, the largest and noblest trees. Thorns easily catch fire (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-5.htm">Exodus 22:5</a>). The most insignificant and most worthless man can be the cause of harm to the mightiest and most distinguished. </body></html>
