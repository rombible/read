It may be so, for the narrative gives us no further details; but unless Zebul was in some way secured by his own adherents from Gaal’s immediate vengeance, it seems better to take it as a sort of expostulation against Gaal’s past rashness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/9-38.htm" title="Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, with which you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that you have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them....">Jdg 9:38-40</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then said Zebul, Where is now thy mouth, </span>&c. — Now show thyself a man, and fight valiantly for thyself and the people. <span class="ital">And he fled — </span>Being surprised by the unexpected coming of Abimelech, and probably not fully prepared for the encounter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:30-49 Abimelech intended to punish the Schechemites for slighting him now, but God punished them for their serving him formerly in the murder of Gideon's sons. When God uses men as instruments in his hand to do his work, he means one thing, and they another. That, which they hoped would have been for their welfare, proved a snare and a trap, as those will certainly find, who run to idols for shelter; such will prove a refuge of lies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The plain of Meonenim - Translate "the oak of the soothsayers" (see the margin).
