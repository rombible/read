The happiest life of individuals, and the happiest state of society, is that which affords the fewest remarkable events. To live in credit and quiet, to be peacefully useful to those around us, to possess a clear conscience; but, above all, and without which nothing can avail, to enjoy communion with God our Saviour while we live, and to die at peace with God and man, form the substance of all that a wise man can desire.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Zebulonite - The tribe of Zebulon had shown its bravery, patriotism, and prowess in the time of Barak <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-10.htm">Judges 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

And "when fugitives of Ephraim wanted to cross, the men of Gilead asked them, Art thou Ephrathi," i.e., an Ephraimite? And if he said no, they made him pronounce the word Shibboleth (a stream or flood, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-16.htm">Psalm 69:16</a>; not an ear of corn, which is quite unsuitable here); "and if he said, Sibboleth, not taking care to pronounce it correctly, they laid hold of him and put him to death at the fords of the Jordan." In this manner there fell at that time, i.e., during the whole war, 42,000 Ephraimites. The "fugitives of Ephraim" were the Ephraimites who had escaped from the battle and wished to return home. The expression is used here in its ordinary sense, and not with the contemptuous sense in which the Ephraimites had used it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-4.htm">Judges 12:4</a>. From this history we learn quite casually that the Ephraimites generally pronounced sh (shin) like s (samech). &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; is used elliptically for &#1500;&#1489; &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, to direct his heart to anything, pay heed (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-14.htm">2 Chronicles 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-19.htm">2 Chronicles 30:19</a>). </body></html>
