It seems to be implied that in spite of Jephthah’s perfectly reasonable answer the Ephraimites advanced to attack Gilead, and goaded the Gileadites to fury by intolerable taunts, which prevented the Gileadites from giving any quarter when they had won the victory.<p><span class= "bld">Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim.</span>—If the English Version is here correct, the meaning is, “You people of the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh are a mere race of runaway slaves, <span class= "ital">who belong neither to Ephraim nor to Manasseh” </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-10.htm" title="And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.">1Samuel 25:10</a>). It is very possible that fierce jealousies may have sprung up between the Eastern Manassites and their tribal brethren of the West, and that these may have mainly originated in the fact that the Eastern Manassites less and less acknowledged the lead of Ephraim, but changing their character and their habits, threw in their lot more and more with the pastoral tribes of Reuben and Gad. The taunt sounds as if it had sprung from a schism in clanship, a contemptuous disclaimer on the part of Ephraim of any ties with this Eastern half-tribe. Indeed, the taunt may have been so far true that very probably any who fell into debt or disgrace in Ephraim and Eastern Manasseh might be as likely to fly to Western Manasseh as an English defaulter might escape to New York. And if the Ephraimites indulged in such shameful jibes, it might well be deemed sufficient to account for the ruthless character of the fighting. But the rendering of the English Version is very uncertain, and the versions vary in the view they take of the meaning, punctuation, and even of the reading of the passage. On the whole, the best view is to render the words thus: <span class= "ital">The men of Gilead smote Ephraim </span>[not only in the battle, but in the far more fatal pursuit] <span class= "ital">because they </span>[the men of Gilead] <span class= "ital">said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim </span>(see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm" title="And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No;">Judges 12:5</a>). Then follows the geographical explanation and historical illustration of the clause, which is, “It was possible for the Gileadites to inflict this vengeance, for (1) Gilead [lies] between Ephraim and [Eastern] Manasseh.” [Part, at any rate, of Gilead belonged to Gad, and lies geographically between the district of Eastern Manasseh and the district of Ephraim, as is sufficiently clear since Ephraim has advanced “northwards,” or <span class= "ital">towards Tsaphon </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.">Judges 12:1</a>), for the attack.] Then (2) there follows the seizure of the fords, which led to the total slaughter of all these Ephraimite fugitives. One slight circumstance which adds probability to this view is that “fugitives” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm" title="So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.">Jeremiah 44:14</a>) is a term which could hardly be applied to a <span class= "ital">whole tribe.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-4.htm" title="Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.">Jdg 12:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">The men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, </span>&c. — That which provoked the army of Jephthah to kill so many of them was their insulting language, added to their threats, whereby they reproached the men of Gilead, (who were the chief managers of the late war,) as if they were but the scum and dregs of the tribe of Ephraim. <span class="ital">Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim — </span>A contemptuous expression, designed to provoke and kindle wrath.

It often occasions quarrels that prove of ill consequence, as it did here. No contentions are so bitter as those between brethren or rivals for honour.

Render: - "The men of Gilead smote Ephraim, for they (the Gileadites) said, Ye are. the fugitives of Ephraim. (Gilead lies between Ephraim and Manasseh; and Gilead took the fords of Jordan before Ephraim, and it came to pass, when the fugitives of Ephraim said Let me pass over, and the Gileadites asked him, art thou an Ephraimite, and he answered No, Then (the Gileadites) said to him say Shibboleth, etc. So they (the Gileadites) killed them at the fords of Jordan"). All that is included in the parenthesis is explanatory of the brief statement "They smote them, for they said, Ye are the fugitives of Ephraim;" i. e. in spite of denial they ascertained that they were the fugitives of Ephraim, and so pitilessly slaughtered them when they endeavored to return to their own country through Gilead. This part of Gilead, where the fords were, was clearly not in Manasseh, but in Gad. "Slew" <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm">Judges 12:6</a> implies "slaughtering" in cold blood, not killing in battle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>). The word in the original text is the proper word for slaying animals for sacrifice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 12:4-15. Discerned by the Word Sibboleth, Are Slain by the Gileadites.<p>4-6. the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim&#8212;The remonstrances of Jephthah, though reasonable and temperate, were not only ineffectual, but followed by insulting sneers that the Gileadites were reckoned both by the western Manassites and Ephraimites as outcasts&#8212;the scum and refuse of their common stock. This was addressed to a peculiarly sensitive people. A feud immediately ensued. The Gileadites, determined to chastise this public affront, gave them battle; and having defeated the Ephraimites, they chased their foul-mouthed but cowardly assailants out of the territory. Then rushing to the fords of the Jordan, they intercepted and slew every fugitive. The method adopted for discovering an Ephraimite was by the pronunciation of a word naturally suggested by the place where they stood. Shibboleth, means "a stream"; Sibboleth, "a burden." The Eastern tribe had, it seems, a dialectical provincialism in the sound of Shibboleth; and the Ephraimites could not bring their organs to pronounce it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> According to this translation, these words are a scoffing and contemptuous expression of the Ephraimites concerning the Gileadites, whom they call fugitives of Ephraim; the word <span class="ital">Ephraim</span> being here taken largely, as it is elsewhere as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-2.htm" title="And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.">Isaiah 7:2</a>,5</span>, so as it comprehends the other neighbouring tribes, of which Ephraim was in some sort the head or chief; and especially their brethren of Manasseh, who lived next to them, and were descended from the same father, Joseph; by reason whereof both these tribes are sometimes reckoned for one, and called by the name of <span class="ital">the tribe of Joseph</span>. And this large signification of Ephraim may seem probable from the following words, where, instead of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ephraim, </span> is put the <span class="ital">Ephraimites and the Manassites</span>. By <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gileadites</span> here they seem principally to mean the Manassites beyond Jordan, who dwelt in Gilead, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm" title="And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.">Deu 3:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm" title="There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.">Joshua 17:1</a>,5,6</span>. And although other Gileadites were joined with them, yet they vent their passion against these; principally, because they envied them most; partly, because they seemed to have had a chief hand in the victory, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm" title="Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.">Judges 11:29</a></span>; and partly, because they were more nearly related to them, and therefore more obliged to desire their conjunction with them in the war. These they here opprobriously call <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">fugitives, </span> i.e. such as had deserted their brethren of Ephraim and Manasseh, and for some worldly advantage planted themselves beyond Jordan, at a distance from their brethren, and were alienated in affection from them, and carried on a distinct and separate interest of their own, as appears by their monopolizing the glory of this success to themselves, and excluding their brethren from it. According to the Hebrew, the words lie and may be rendered thus, <span class="ital">Therefore</span> (so <span class="ital">chi</span> is oft rendered) <span class="ital">they said, Fugitives of Ephraim are ye</span>, (i.e. Ye Ephraimites are mere runaways; for the words next foregoing are, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the men, of Gilead smote Ephraim.</span> And having told you what they said, because the pronoun <span class="ital">they</span> was ambiguous, he adds by way of explication,) who said it, even the Gileadites, (and they said it when they had got the advantage over them, and got between them and home, as the next verse shows,) being <span class="ital">between Ephraim, and Manasseh</span>; i.e. having taken the passages of Jordan, as it follows, which lay between Ephraim and that part of Manasseh which was beyond Jordan. Or these latter words may be rendered thus, And <span class="ital">the Gileadites</span> were <span class="ital">between Ephraim and Manasseh</span>. So there is only an ellipsis of two small words, which are oft defective, and to be understood in Scripture. Or thus, And <span class="ital">the Gileadites were in the midst of the Ephraimites</span>, and <span class="ital">in the midst of the Manassites</span>, to wit, those Manassites who ordinarily lived within Jordan, who possibly were confederate with the Ephraimites in this quarrel. And so the meaning is, they followed close after them, and overtook them, and fell upon the midst of them, and smote them; and they sent a party to intercept them at the passages of Jordan, as it here follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim,.... The Ephraimites not being pacified with the account Jephthah gave of the war between him and the children of Ammon, but continuing in their tumultuous outrage; he, being a man of spirit and courage, got as many of the Gileadites together as he could, and gave them battle: <p>and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim; had the advantage of them, worsted them, killed many of them, and put the rest to flight: <p>because they said, ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites; what provoked them to fall upon them with the greater fury, and use them the more severely when, they had the better of them, was their reproachful language to them, insulting the Gileadites, who perhaps were chiefly, if not all, of the half tribe of Manasseh beyond Jordan, of which Jephthah was, that they were the scum of the house of Joseph, that they had run away from their brethren, and dwelt in a corner of the land by themselves; and were of no account at all among Ephraim and Manasseh, and disclaimed by them both, and not esteemed by either. The Targum is,"the fugitives of Ephraim said, what are ye Gileadites accounted of among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites?''on which Kimchi remarks, that those Ephraimites that came in this tumultuous manner, and insulted Jephthah, were a most abject company of men, the refuse of the tribe of Ephraim, shepherds who through necessity were obliged to come over Jordan with their flocks and herds for pasture: but the words may be rendered, "for they said, fugitives of Ephraim are ye, even the Gileadites, who were, or being between the Ephraimites and the Manassites"; that is, the Gileadites called the Ephraimites so, when they fled before them, and when they got at the fords of Jordan, which lay between Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh on the other side Jordan; and they are in the next verse expressly so called. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites <i>are</i> fugitives of Ephraim <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> among the Ephraimites, <i>and</i> among the Manassites.</span><p>(d) You ran from us, and chose Gilead, and now in respect to us you are nothing.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">because they said … Manasseh</span>] These words, which make no sense where they stand, and are omitted by some mss. of the LXX and marked with an asterisk in Syro-Hex., probably belonged in part to <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm" title="Then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right.
