It is strange, that in the history of all these judges, there is not so much as once mention of the high-priest, or of any other priest or Levite, appearing either for counsel or action in any public affair, from Phinehas to Eli, which may well be computed two hundred and fifty years! Surely this intimates that the institution was chiefly intended to be typical, and that the benefits which were promised by it were to be chiefly looked for in its antitype, the everlasting priesthood of Christ, in comparison of which that priesthood had no glory. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:8-15 We have here a short account of three more of the judges of Israel. The happiest life of individuals, and the happiest state of society, is that which affords the fewest remarkable events. To live in credit and quiet, to be peacefully useful to those around us, to possess a clear conscience; but, above all, and without which nothing can avail, to enjoy communion with God our Saviour while we live, and to die at peace with God and man, form the substance of all that a wise man can desire.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Pirathonite - He was, therefore, an Ephraimite <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-14.htm">1 Chronicles 27:14</a>.

The 25 years, apparently consecutive, occupied by the judgeship of Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon, seem to have been very uneventful and prosperous, since the only record of them, preserved in the annals of their country, relates to the flourishing families and peaceful magnificence of two of the number. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Moore (<span class="ital">Polychr.

A. = the Hebr. Shaâlim. Since there is no way of accounting for the reading of these mss. by any confusion of letters, it may well be that they have preserved the true text here: <span class="ital">in the hill country of </span>E<span class="ital">., in the land of Shaâlim</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mount of the Amalekites</span>. This name points to some incident of which the memory is lost, though, with the usual tenacity of names, the name which once recorded it survives. It may have been some ancient settlement of the Amalekites, who were a very wandering, wide-spread race, which gave the name; or it may have been some great defeat and slaughter which they suffered from the Israelites, whose land they invaded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3, 33</a>), just as the rock Oreb and the wine-press of Zeeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>) commemorated the victory over those princes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of these three judges no particular deeds are related, just as in the case of Tola and Jair (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-1.htm">Judges 10:1</a>).
