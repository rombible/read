It is uncertain whether Bethlehem of Judah is meant, or Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebu-lun, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>. Josephus says that Ibzan was of the tribe of Judah, and of the city of Bethlehem, and some have supposed a connection between the names of Boaz and Ibzan. ' But as Bethlehem of the tribe of Judah is generally called Bethlehem of Judah, or Bethlehem-Ephratah, and as Elon and Abdon were judges in North-East Israel, it is perhaps more probable that Bethlehem of Zebulun is meant. Dr. Robinson has identified it with a village - a "very miserable one" - called <span class="accented">Beit Lahm</span>, six miles west of Nazareth. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jephthah's War with the Ephraimites, and Office of Judge. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1</a>. The jealousy of the tribe of Ephraim, which was striving after the leadership, had already shown itself in the time of Gideon in such a way that nothing but the moderation of that judge averted open hostilities. And now that the tribes on the east of the Jordan had conquered the Ammonites under the command of Jephthah without the co-operation of the Ephraimites, Ephraim thought it necessary to assert its claim to take the lead in Israel in a very forcible manner. The Ephraimites gathered themselves together, and went over &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;. This is generally regarded as an appellative noun (northward); but in all probability it is a proper name, "to Zaphon," the city of the Gadites in the Jordan valley, which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> along with Succoth, that is to say, according to a statement of the Gemara, though of a very uncertain character no doubt, &#x391;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; (Joseph. Ant. xiii. 13, 5, xiv. 5, 4; Bell. Judg. i. 4, 2, Reland, Pal. pp. 308 and 559-60), the modern ruins of Amata on the Wady Rajb or Ajlun, the situation of which would suit this passage very well. They then threatened Jephthah, because he had made war upon the Ammonites without them, and said, "We will burn thy house over thee with fire." Their arrogance and threat Jephthah opposed most energetically. He replied (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-2.htm">Judges 12:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>), "A man of strife have I been, I and my people on the one hand, and the children of Ammon on the other, very greatly," i.e., I and my people had a severe conflict with the Ammonites. "Then I called you, but ye did not deliver me out of their hand; and when I saw that thou (Ephraim) didst not help me, I put my life in my hand" (i.e., I risked my own life: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-21.htm">1 Samuel 28:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm">Job 13:14</a>. The Kethibh &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492; comes from &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501;: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-33.htm">Genesis 24:33</a>), "and I went against the Ammonites, and Jehovah gave them into my hand." Jephthah's appeal to the Ephraimites to fight against the Ammonites it not mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>, probably for no other reason than because it was without effect. The Ephraimites, however, had very likely refused their co-operation simply because the Gileadites had appointed Jephthah as commander without consulting them. Consequently the Ephraimites had no ground whatever for rising up against Jephthah and the Gileadites in this haughty and hostile manner; and Jephthah had a perfect right not only to ask them, "Wherefore are ye come up against me now (lit. 'this day'), to fight against me?" but to resist such conduct with the sword. </body></html>
