The happiest life of individuals, and the happiest state of society, is that which affords the fewest remarkable events. To live in credit and quiet, to be peacefully useful to those around us, to possess a clear conscience; but, above all, and without which nothing can avail, to enjoy communion with God our Saviour while we live, and to die at peace with God and man, form the substance of all that a wise man can desire.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Pirathonite - He was, therefore, an Ephraimite <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-14.htm">1 Chronicles 27:14</a>. Its name still lingers in "Feratah," 6 miles west of Shechem. The 25 years, apparently consecutive, occupied by the judgeship of Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon, seem to have been very uneventful and prosperous, since the only record of them, preserved in the annals of their country, relates to the flourishing families and peaceful magnificence of two of the number. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

He was followed by a succession of minor judges, of whom the only memorials preserved relate to the number of their families and their state [Jud 12:8-15].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And after him Abdon the son of Hillell, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
