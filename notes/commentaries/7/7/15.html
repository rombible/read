But when every man had taken his post just on the outside of the camp, then they broke the pitchers, that they might have the advantage of the lamps, and at the same time cast a great terror upon the Midianites; who, from the number of the lights in different places, doubtless concluded that they were surrounded by a numerous army; and to this terror the number of trumpets, (each man sounding one,) and the shouts from different parts, greatly contributed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:9-15 The dream seemed to have little meaning in it; but the interpretation evidently proved the whole to be from the Lord, and discovered that the name of Gideon had filled the Midianites with terror. Gideon took this as a sure pledge of success; without delay he worshipped and praised God, and returned with confidence to his three hundred men. Wherever we are, we may speak to God, and worship him. God must have the praise of that which encourages our faith. And his providence must be acknowledged in events, though small and seemingly accidental.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon - The word rendered tumbled in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>, is rather descriptive of a sword brandished (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). Hence, the interpretation "the sword of Gideon." Hearing this dream and the interpretation would convince Gideon that he was indeed under the guidance of God, and so assure him of God's aid; and secondly, it would show him that a panic had already fallen npon the mind of the enemy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation &#8230; he worshipped&#8212;The incident originated in the secret overruling providence of God, and Gideon, from his expression of pious gratitude, regarded it as such. On his mind, as well as that of his followers, it produced the intended effect&#8212;that of imparting new animation and impulse to their patriotism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Gideon understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the telling of the dream, </span> though spoken in the Midianitish language; either because it was near akin to the Hebrew, being only a different dialect of it; or because the Israelites had now been accustomed to the Midianites’ company and discourse for seven years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He worshipped; </span> he praised God for this miraculous work and special encouragement, whereby he was confirmed in his enterprise. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof,.... Or, "the breaking of it" (g); the dream itself being like something closed up and sealed, and the interpretation of it was like the breaking of a seal, and discovering what is hid under it; or like a nut, the kernel of which cannot be come at till the shell is broken: <p>that he worshipped; bowed his head with an awful reverence of God and a sense of his divine Majesty, and worshipped him by sending an ejaculatory prayer and praise to him; and so the Targum,"and he praised''praised God for this gracious encouragement he had given, the assurance of victory he now had; for he saw clearly the hand of God in all this, both in causing one of the soldiers to dream as he did, and giving the other the interpretation of it, and himself the hearing of both: <p>and returned into the host of Israel; such an one as it was, consisting only of three hundred unarmed men: and said, arise; from their sleep and beds, it being the night season; and from their tents, and descend the hill with him: <p>for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian; he made now no doubt of it, it was as sure to him as if it had been actually done; hence Gideon is renowned for his faith, though he sometimes was not without his fits of diffidence; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a>. <p>(g) "fractionem ejus", Vatablus, Drusius; "fracturam ejus", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it was <i>so</i>, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</span><p>(g) Or, gave God thanks, as it is in the Chaldea text.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was so</span>, etc. The effect upon Gideon was like magic. He not only learnt the state of panic in which the Midianites were, but he had a further certainty that God was with him. His simple piety and adoring gratitude threw him at once upon his knees to thank God, and to cast himself anew upon his strength with un-doubting trust. His hands were indeed strengthened, and he lost not a moment in returning to his 300, relating in a few words the incident of the dream, and bidding them follow him. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath delivered</span>, etc. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Gideon's Battle and Victory. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9-11</a>. The following night the Lord commanded Gideon to go down to the camp of the enemy, as He had given it into his hand (the perfect is used to denote the purpose of God which had already been formed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>). But in order to fill him with confidence for such an enterprise, which to all human appearance was a very rash one, God added, "If thou art afraid to go down, go thou with thine attendant Purah down to the camp, and thou wilt hear what they say, and thy hands will thereby become strong." The meaning of the protasis is not, If thou art afraid to go down into the camp of the enemy alone, or to visit the enemy unarmed, take Purah thine armour-bearer with thee, to make sure that thou hast weapons to use (Bertheau); for, apart from the fact that the addition "unarmed" is perfectly arbitrary, the apodosis "thou wilt see," etc., by no means agrees with this explanation. The meaning is rather this: Go with thy 300 men into (&#1489;&#1468;) the hostile camp to smite it, for I have given it into thy hand; but if thou art afraid to do this, go down with thine attendant to (&#1488;&#1500;) the camp, to ascertain the state and feeling of the foe, and thou wilt hear what they say, i.e., as we gather from what follows, how they are discouraged, have lost all hope of defeating you, and from that thou wilt gather courage and strength for the battle. On the expression "thine hands shall be strengthened," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-7.htm">2 Samuel 2:7</a>. The expression which follows, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;, is not a mere repetition of the command to go down with his attendant to the hostile camp, but describes the result of the stimulus given to his courage: And then thou wilt go fearlessly into the hostile camp to attack the foe. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>) is to be distinguished from &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-10.htm">Judges 7:10</a>. The former signifies to go down into the camp to smite the foe; the latter, to go down to the camp to reconnoitre it, and is equivalent to the following clause: "he went to the outside of the camp." </body></html>
