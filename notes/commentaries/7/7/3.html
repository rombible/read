It is there founded on the psychological observation that cowardice is exceedingly contagious, so that the presence of timid men in an army is a source of direct danger. The same rule was rigidly observed by the faithful Judas Maccabæus (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-56.htm" title="But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law.">1 Maccabees 3:56</a>). Epaminondas, for the same reason, made the same proclamation before the battle of Leuctra. In this instance there was the further reason given in the previous verse. “The ancients had observed that even when there are many legions it is always the few that win the battle” (Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. xiv.</span> 36).<p><span class= "bld">Depart early.</span>—The Hebrew word <span class= "ital">tsaphar </span>occurs here only. The Chaldee explains it by <span class= "ital">tsiphra, </span>“in the morning;” and Abarband says that this injunction was given in order that they might not incur shame when they retired. The rendering “hastily” is explained to mean “like a bird” (<span class= "ital">tsippor</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Keil, connecting it with an Arabic root, makes it mean “slink away by bye-paths.” It seems to involve a shade of contempt—“Let him take himself off.” (<span class= "ital">Trolle </span>sich: Cassel.)<p><span class= "bld">From mount Gilead.</span>—This expression has caused great difficulty, but the Hebrew cannot mean <span class= "ital">“to </span>mount Gilead,” nor yet “<span class= "ital">beyond </span>mount Gilead.” The only tenable solution of the difficulty is, (1) to alter the text into “mount Gilboa” (Clericus), or from <span class= "ital">meehar, </span>“from mount,” to <span class= "ital">maheer, </span>“speedily” (Michaelis); or (2) to suppose that “mount Gilead” was a rallying-cry of the Manassites in general, for Gilead was a son of Abiezer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-30.htm" title="These are the sons of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the Jeezerites: of Helek, the family of the Helekites:">Numbers 26:30</a>, where Jeezer is merely an error); and hence was derived the name “Gilead” of the trans-Jordanic district which fell to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/17-5.htm" title="And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;">Joshua 17:5-6</a>). If this be a true conjecture, the phrase “let him depart from mount Gilead” means “let him leave the camp of Manasseh.” One more conjecture is that Gilead is an ancient name for Gilboa (Schwarz).<p><span class= "bld">There returned of the people twenty and two thousand.</span>—No detail could more decisively show the terror struck into them by the sight of the Midianite host. They looked on them with the same alarm with which the Greeks, before Marathon, used to gaze on the Persian dress. It must not, however, be supposed that all the defaulters went straight to their homes. Doubtless many of them took part in the pursuit which made the victory decisive.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-3.htm" title="Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.

God provides that the praise of victory may be wholly to himself, by appointing only three hundred men to be employed. Activity and prudence go with dependence upon God for help in our lawful undertakings. When the Lord sees that men would overlook him, and through unbelief, would shrink from perilous services, or that through pride they would vaunt themselves against him, he will set them aside, and do his work by other instruments. Pretences will be found by many, for deserting the cause and escaping the cross. But though a religious society may thus be made fewer in numbers, yet it will gain as to purity, and may expect an increased blessing from the Lord. God chooses to employ such as are not only well affected, but zealously affected in a good thing. They grudged not at the liberty of the others who were dismissed. In doing the duties required by God, we must not regard the forwardness or backwardness of others, nor what they do, but what God looks for at our hands. He is a rare person who can endure that others should excel him in gifts or blessings, or in liberty; so that we may say, it is by the special grace of God that we regard what God says to us, and not look to men what they do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The proclamation was in accordance with the Law (see the marginal reference). No mountain of the name of Gilead is known in this locality, and it has been conjectured that the right reading is Gilboa. Others think that this may be a form of proclamation customary in Manasseh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Now therefore &#8230;, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful &#8230; let him return&#8212;This proclamation was in terms of an established law (De 20:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mount Gilead; </span> not that famous Mount Gilead which was beyond Jordan; for it is apparent that both the camps of the Israelites and of the Midianites were on this side Jordan: but another Mount Gilead in the tribe of Manasseh; which might be so called, either for some resemblance it had with the other Mount Gilead, or in remembrance of their father Gilead; or that this might be a memorial of their near relation to their brethren, notwithstanding their being divided one from another by Jordan; or for some other reason now unknown at this distance of time and place. Or, the words may be rendered <span class="ital">towards Mount Gilead</span>; for the Hebrew particle mid, or mere, is sometimes rendered <span class="ital">towards</span>, of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelled there.">Genesis 11:2</a> 13:11 <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm" title="My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain on the tender herb, and as the showers on the grass:">Deu 32:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm" title="And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwells between the cherubim.">2 Samuel 6:2</a></span>. And so it may be understood of the famous Mount Gilead beyond Jordan, which he may mention here, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because many of his soldiers were of that half tribe of Manasseh which dwelt there, and so it was most proper for them to return thither; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because that was their safest course, to get furthest from the danger which they feared; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Because though he would remove them from danger, yet he would not have them dispersed, but kept together in a body about Mount Gilead; knowing that they who had not courage enough to fight their enemies, might have valour enough to pursue them when they were beaten by others; and suspecting that the Midianites, if beaten, would probably flee that way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Twenty and two thousand; </span> who finding their whole army to be very small in comparison of their enemy’s, who were a hundred and thirty-live thousand, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-10.htm" title="Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.">Judges 8:10</a></span>, and they, no doubt, well armed and disciplined, and encouraged by long success; whereas the Israelites were dispirited with long servitude, and many of them unfurnished with arms and provisions, lost the courage which in the beginning they seemed to have. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,.... Such a proclamation as follows, was, according to the law of God, to be made when Israel went out to battle against their enemies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-8.htm">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>; though it looks as if Gideon would not have made such proclamation, had he not been directed to it by the Lord, his army being so small in comparison of the enemy; and perhaps Gideon might understand that law to have respect only to war made for the enlargement of their country, and not for defence against invaders: <p>saying, whosoever is fearful and afraid; to, engage in battle, because of the number of the enemy: <p>let him return, and depart early from Mount Gilead; where it seems they now were, being the same with the hill of Moreh, or adjoining to it; a mountain in the tribe of Manasseh, so called either from its likeness to Mount Gilead on the other side Jordan; or rather in memory of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from whence the half tribe sprung, which was on this side, as well as that on the other; and perhaps this name might be given to the mount, to show that they were of the same tribe, though separated by Jordan: now the fearful and faint hearted had leave given them by this proclamation to return home directly; and as both armies lay so near, and it might reasonably be expected the battle would be the next day, they are directed to get away in the morning, as early as they could, that they might not be seen, and so be filled with shame themselves, and discourage others. Though some think Mount Gilead, on the other side Jordan, is meant, from whence it is supposed many came to Gideon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-35.htm">Judges 6:35</a> and now are ordered to return back, as many as were fearful; and instead of "from", they render the word "to", or "towards", or "beyond" Gilead. Kimchi thinks the word we render "depart early" has the signification of surrounding, a diadem being expressed by a word from hence, which encompasses the head, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a> and so the sense is, that they were ordered to go round about Mount Gilead, and so return home; but it rather may signify their hasty departure and speedy flight, like that of a bird, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1</a> and there returned of the people 22,000, and there remained 10,000; so that they were in all 32,000: now though these of their own accord came and joined Gideon with an intention and resolution to stand by him, and fight the enemy, yet when they came and saw what a large host they had to engage with, and how small the army was with Gideon, their hearts failed them, and they were glad to take the advantage of the proclamation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.

"If Thou," he said to God, "art saving Israel through my hand, as Thou hast said, behold, I lay this fleece of wool upon the floor; if there shall be dew upon the fleece only, and dryness upon all the earth (round about), I know (by this) that Thou wilt save," etc. &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1514;, the shorn of the wool; i.e., the fleece, the wool that had been shorn off a sheep, and still adhered together as one whole fleece. The sign which Gideon asked for, therefore, was that God would cause the dew to fall only upon a shorn fleece, which he would spread the previous night upon the floor, that is to say, upon some open ground, and that the ground all round might not be moistened by the dew.</body></html>
