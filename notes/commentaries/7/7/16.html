God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, a barley-cake to overthrow the tents of Midian, that the excellency of the power might be of God only. The gospel is a sword, not in the hand, but in the mouth: the sword of the Lord and of Gideon; of God and Jesus Christ, of Him that sits on the throne and the Lamb. The wicked are often led to avenge the cause of God upon each other, under the power of their delusions, and the fury of their passions.

It is usually objected that one pair of hands (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-16.htm" title="And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.">Jdg 7:16</a></span>) could not have carried a trumpet and a pitcher with a lighted (?) torch inside; the objection is rather prosaic; such a difficulty would not, perhaps, have occurred to an ancient writer. But the fact remains that the text in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-17.htm" title="And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do.">Jdg 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-20.htm" title="And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.">Jdg 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-22.htm" title="And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.">Jdg 7:22</a></span> is clearly not in its original form; are we to explain the overloading as the work of subsequent editors, or as an attempt to combine two different narratives of the same event? The latter explanation is adopted by most recent commentators; it is supposed that in one narrative the trumpets played a leading part, in the other, the pitchers and torches. At any rate the trumpets cannot have been introduced by a later hand, for they form a prominent feature of the story; so perhaps we can only suppose that here, as elsewhere in the history of Gideon (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/6-11.htm" title="And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites....">Jdg 6:11-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-35.htm" title="And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.">Jdg 6:35</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-23.htm" title="And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.">Jdg 7:23</a>), two versions have been harmonized with more or less success. But to separate them is difficult; none of the attempts at an analysis can be called satisfactory.

The following night the Lord commanded Gideon to go down to the camp of the enemy, as He had given it into his hand (the perfect is used to denote the purpose of God which had already been formed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>). But in order to fill him with confidence for such an enterprise, which to all human appearance was a very rash one, God added, "If thou art afraid to go down, go thou with thine attendant Purah down to the camp, and thou wilt hear what they say, and thy hands will thereby become strong." The meaning of the protasis is not, If thou art afraid to go down into the camp of the enemy alone, or to visit the enemy unarmed, take Purah thine armour-bearer with thee, to make sure that thou hast weapons to use (Bertheau); for, apart from the fact that the addition "unarmed" is perfectly arbitrary, the apodosis "thou wilt see," etc., by no means agrees with this explanation. The meaning is rather this: Go with thy 300 men into (&#1489;&#1468;) the hostile camp to smite it, for I have given it into thy hand; but if thou art afraid to do this, go down with thine attendant to (&#1488;&#1500;) the camp, to ascertain the state and feeling of the foe, and thou wilt hear what they say, i.e., as we gather from what follows, how they are discouraged, have lost all hope of defeating you, and from that thou wilt gather courage and strength for the battle. On the expression "thine hands shall be strengthened," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-7.htm">2 Samuel 2:7</a>. The expression which follows, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;, is not a mere repetition of the command to go down with his attendant to the hostile camp, but describes the result of the stimulus given to his courage: And then thou wilt go fearlessly into the hostile camp to attack the foe. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>) is to be distinguished from &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-10.htm">Judges 7:10</a>. The former signifies to go down into the camp to smite the foe; the latter, to go down to the camp to reconnoitre it, and is equivalent to the following clause: "he went to the outside of the camp." </body></html>
