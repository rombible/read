It was like “the Jews’ wailing-place” in modern Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">They sacrificed there unto the Lord.</span>—It is not <span class= "ital">necessary </span>to infer from this that Bochim must have been near the sanctuary at Bethel, Shechem, or Shiloh. Not only did kings and prophets seem to be tacitly excepted from the general rule against offering sacrifice at any place except the chosen sanctuary, but also sacrifice was always freely offered at places where there had been any manifestation of the Divine Presence—<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-20.htm" title="And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.

God sets forth what he had done for Israel, and what he had promised. Those who throw off communion with God, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, know not what they do now, and will have nothing to say for themselves in the day of account shortly. They must expect to suffer for this their folly. Those deceive themselves who expect advantages from friendship with God's enemies. God often makes men's sin their punishment; and thorns and snares are in the way of the froward, who will walk contrary to God. The people wept, crying out against their own folly and ingratitude. They trembled at the word, and not without cause. It is a wonder sinners can ever read the Bible with dry eyes. Had they kept close to God and their duty, no voice but that of singing had been heard in their congregation; but by their sin and folly they made other work for themselves, and nothing is to be heard but the voice of weeping. The worship of God, in its own nature, is joy, praise, and thanksgiving; our sins alone render weeping needful. It is pleasing to see men weep for their sins; but our tears, prayers, and even amendment, cannot atone for sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bochim - i. e. weepers.

Which signifies "weepers", from the general lamentation of the people, which before had another name; very probably it was Shiloh itself since all Israel was gathered together, the tabernacle being now at Shiloh, and also because sacrifices were offered up, as follows: <p>and they sacrificed there unto the Lord; to atone for the sins they had committed; and if they did this in the faith of the great sacrifice of the Messiah, they did well; however, so far there was an acknowledgment of their, guilt, and a compliance with the appointments of God directed to in such cases. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">Bochim</span>] i.e. ‘Weepers.’ The author sees in this name of the place a recollection of the Angel’s reproof and the people’s repentance. But such a form as Bochim, active ptcp. plur., is very unusual in a place-name, and it has probably been adapted to suit the present occasion. Originally the name may have been Bekaim ‘balsam-trees,’ cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-23.htm" title="And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.">2 Samuel 5:23</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-6.htm" title="Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also fills the pools.">Psalm 84:6</a> (see RVm.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and they sacrificed there</span>] i.e. in Beth-el; see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Jdg 2:1</a></span> a, to which this sentence belongs. The appearance of the Angel consecrates the place, and an altar henceforward marks it as a sanctuary; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-24.htm" title="Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.">Jdg 6:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/13-15.htm" title="And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you....">Jdg 13:15-20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand.

Another ancient tradition carried back the consecration of Beth-el to the times of the patriarch Jacob, Genesis 28, 35; according to the later view of the Priestly writer the religious centre of Israel was not at Beth-el, but at Shiloh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm" title="And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there.

On the contrary, the Amorites forced Dan up into the mountains, and would not suffer them to come down into the plain. But the territory allotted to the Danytes was almost all in the plain (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40</a>). If, therefore, they were forced out of that, they were almost entirely excluded from their inheritance. The Amorites emboldened themselves (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>) to dwell in Har-cheres, Ajalon, and Shaalbim. On the last two places see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a>, where Ir-shemesh is also mentioned. This combination, and still more the meaning of the names Har-cheres, i.e., sun-mountain, and Ir-shemesh, i.e., sun-town, make the conjecture a very probable one, that Har-cheres is only another name for Ir-shemesh, i.e., the present Ain Shems (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>, and Rob. Pal. iii. pp. 17, 18). This pressure on the part of the Amorites induced a portion of the Danites to emigrate, and seek for an inheritance in the north of Palestine (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>). On the other hand, the Amorites were gradually made tributary by the powerful tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, who bounded Dan on the north. "The hand of the house of Joseph lay heavy," sc., upon the Amorites in the towns already named on the borders of Ephraim. For the expression itself, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>. </body></html>
