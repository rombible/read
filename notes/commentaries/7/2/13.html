The plural form may be, as Ewald thinks, the plural of excellence, or like Baalim an allusion to the different forms and attributes under which the goddess was worshipped. The worship of Baalim and Ashtaroth naturally went hand in hand. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm" title="Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.">1Samuel 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm" title="And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.">1Samuel 12:10</a>.) Ashtaroth is not to be confused with the Asheroth (rendered “groves” in the E. V.) mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>.

It may not be improper to observe here, that “the reason why the Israelites so often lapsed into idolatry, may easily be deduced from the common notion of tutelary deities, which they had imbibed during their residence in Egypt, which was the fruitful parent of science and idolatry. One generally-received consequence of this opinion was, that the peculiar or tutelary deity of any country could not be neglected, even by the conquerors of that country, without impiety, and that their impiety would certainly meet with punishment from the deity whom they thus neglected. The Israelites, therefore, unwilling to expose themselves to the resentment which the tutelary deity was supposed to take on those who, inhabiting his land, yet slighted his worship; unwilling likewise to leave their paternal God, they incorporated the worship of both; and served not only the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but likewise the <span class="ital">Baalim, </span>or local tutelary deities of the countries wherein they were settled. In process of time this weakness increased to such a degree, that the rights of the tutelary deity of the country were acknowledged to be superior to those of the Gentilitial God of the conquerors. This might arise from the common opinion, that the favours of the local deity were particularly attached and confined to one certain spot; or from an apprehension of the strength of the inhabitants among whom they were settled, who would not have endured to have their god slighted, without vindicating his honour, and endeavouring to extirpate the offenders. This piece of complaisance and condescension the Israelites seem to have been guilty of, when they are said to have forsaken the Lord God of their fathers, and to have followed other gods, the gods of the people that were round about them. Their defection from the God of Israel did not, however, consist in rejecting him as a false god, or in renouncing the law of Moses as a false religion: but only in joining foreign worship and idolatrous ceremonies to the ritual of the true God.” <span class="ital">Div.

The nation made themselves as mean and miserable by forsaking God, as they would have been great and happy if they had continued faithful to him. Their punishment answered to the evil they had done. They served the gods of the nations round about them, even the meanest, and God made them serve the princes of the nations round about them, even the meanest. Those who have found God true to his promises, may be sure that he will be as true to his threatenings. He might in justice have abandoned them, but he could not for pity do it. The Lord was with the judges when he raised them up, and so they became saviours. In the days of the greatest distress of the church, there shall be some whom God will find or make fit to help it. The Israelites were not thoroughly reformed; so mad were they upon their idols, and so obstinately bent to backslide. Thus those who have forsaken the good ways of God, which they have once known and professed, commonly grow most daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts hardened. Their punishment was, that the Canaanites were spared, and so they were beaten with their own rod. Men cherish and indulge their corrupt appetites and passions; therefore God justly leaves them to themselves, under the power of their sins, which will be their ruin. God has told us how deceitful and desperately wicked our hearts are, but we are not willing to believe it, until by making bold with temptation we find it true by sad experience. We need to examine how matters stand with ourselves, and to pray without ceasing, that we may be rooted and grounded in love, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Let us declare war against every sin, and follow after holiness all our days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Provoked the Lord to anger - A frequent expression in connection with idolatry, especially in Deuteronomy, in the Books of the Kings, and in Jeremiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The worship of the Lord, as the Targum; this is repeated to observe the heinous sin they were guilty of, and how displeasing it was to God: <p>and served Baal and Ashtaroth; two images, as the Arabic version adds; Baal, from whence Baalim, may signify the he deities of the Gentiles, as Jupiter, Hercules, &amp;c. and Ashtaroth their female deities, as Juno, Venus, Diana, &amp;c. the word is plural, and used for flocks of sheep, so called because they make the owners of them rich; and Kimchi and Ben Melech say these were images in the form of female sheep. Perhaps, as Baal may signify the sun, so Ashtaroth the moon, and the stars like flocks of sheep about her. Ashtaroth was the goddess of the Zidonians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>; the same with Astarte, the wife of Cronus or Ham, said to be the Phoenician or Syrian Venus. So Lucian says (r) there was a temple in Phoenicia, belonging to the Sidonians, which they say is the temple of Astarte; and, says he, I think that Astarte is the moon; and Astarte is both by the Phoenicians (s) and Grecians (t) said to be Venus, and was worshipped by the Syrians also, as Minutius Felix (u) and Tertullian (w) affirm; the same with Eostre, or Aestar, the Saxon goddess; hence to this day we call the passover Easter (x), being in Eoster-month; and with Andraste, a goddess of the ancient Britains (y). There were four of them, and therefore the Septuagint here uses the plural number Astartes; so called either from Asher, being reckoned "blessed" ones, or from Asheroth, the groves they were worshipped in; or from  "Ash", and  "Tor", the constellation Taurus or the bull; so Astarte by Sanchoniatho is said to put upon her head the head of a bull, as the token of her sovereignty; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>. <p>(r) De Dea Syria.

The God of Israel came from the desert; in the early days of the settlement His home was believed to be in Sinai rather than in Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.">Jdg 5:4</a> f.); hence the popular religion, without ceasing to regard Jehovah as the God of Israel, felt it necessary to pay homage at the same time to the gods of the country. No doubt also the popular mind tended to identify Jehovah with the local Baals and Astartes, whose sanctuaries were scattered over the land. Such confusions gravely imperilled the distinctive character of Israel’s religion; they produced a degradation of faith and morals which led the prophets, and writers of the schools of E and D, stirred by the painful evidence of a later age, to charge Israel with having fallen into Baal-worship from the very day they entered into Canaan; the popular religion could only be described as a ‘forsaking’ of Jehovah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Baal</span>] means lit. <span class="ital">owner, possessor</span>, e.g. of a house <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-22.htm" title="Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him.">Jdg 19:22</a>, of a town (‘citizens’) <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-2.htm" title="Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are three score and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.">Jdg 9:2</a>, of a wife (‘husband’) <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-3.htm" title="If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.">Exodus 21:3</a> etc.; applied to divine beings it is a title conveying the idea of <span class="ital">ownership</span>, or, less probably, of <span class="ital">domination</span>. There was no one god called Baal; each considerable town or district had its deity, the <span class="ital">lord</span> of that particular place. Hence the O.T. speaks of Baal (sing.) in a collective sense, as here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm" title="When Ephraim spoke trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.">Hosea 13:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm" title="For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.">Jeremiah 11:13</a> etc., or of Baâlim (plur.) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:">Jdg 2:11</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Jdg 3:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.">Jdg 8:33</a> etc., meaning the aggregate of local or special Baals. The local Baal is often designated by the name of his town or sanctuary, e.g. B. of Hermon <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm" title="Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelled in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entering in of Hamath.">Jdg 3:3</a>, B. of Tamar <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-33.htm" title="And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.">Jdg 20:33</a>, B. of Meon <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm" title="And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.">Numbers 32:38</a> and Moab. Stone ll. 9, 30; or of some special aspect under which he was worshipped, e.g. B. of the covenant <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-33.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.">Jdg 8:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm" title="And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.">Jdg 9:4</a>, B. of flies <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2 Kings 1:2</a> ff.; at Baal-Gad under Mt Hermon he was worshipped as Gad, the god of fortune. These usages are abundantly illustrated by the Phoenician and Aramaic inscriptions; e.g. we hear of the B. of Zidon, of Tyre, of Lebanon, of Tarsus; occasionally the actual name of the Baal is known—the B. of Tyre was Melḳarth, the Baalath (fem.) of Gebal was ‘Ashtart, the B. of Ḥarran was Sin; we meet with Baal under various aspects, e.g. ‘glowing’ (?<span class="ital">ḥammân</span>), ‘healing’ (<span class="ital">marpç</span>), ‘dancing’ (<span class="ital">marḳôd</span>), ‘of the heavens’ (<span class="ital">shâmçm</span>). Baal was a title of the deity who owned the land, the god of the cultivated field and its produce (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm" title="For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.">Hosea 2:5</a>), of fertilizing warmth, perhaps, but not a sun-god. As denoting <span class="ital">owner, lord</span>, the title could be applied in a harmless sense to Jehovah Himself; this is seen in the proper names Jerubbaal <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm" title="Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.">Jdg 6:32</a> (note) Baal-yah <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-5.htm" title="Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,">1 Chronicles 12:5</a>, one of David’s mighty men, and, in the families of Saul and David, Esh-baal, Merib-baal, Beel-yada, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/8-33.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal....">1 Chronicles 8:33-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-7.htm" title="And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>, altered to Ish-bosheth, Mephi-bosheth, El-yada in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm" title="But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.

Arabia ‘Athtar (a male deity); by the Greeks she was identified with Aphrodite. The meaning of the name is obscure; with regard to the form it will be noticed that the fem. ending in <span class="ital">t</span> is distinctively Canaanite. ‘Ashtart was the goddess of fertility and generation. In the O.T. Baal and ‘Ashtôreth together stand for the false gods and goddesses native to Palestine; and as Hebrew has no word for goddess, ‘Ashtôreth is practically used instead. Here the combination of Baal (sing.) with ‘Ashtârôth (plur., i.e. the many local forms of the goddess) is unusual, and we should probably read (<span class="ital">‘Ashtôreth</span>, the sing., in a collective sense.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baal and Ashtaroth</span>. <span class="accented">Ashtaroth</span> is the plural of <span class="accented">Ashtoreth</span>, the goddess of the Zidonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5, 33</a>), just as <span class="accented">Baalim</span> (ver. 11) is the plural of Baal.

"Baal (lord or master) was the supreme male divinity of the Phoenician and Canaanitish nations, as Ashtoreth (perhaps <span class="accented">the star</span>, the planet Venus) was their supreme female divinity. Baal and Ashtoreth are frequently coupled together. Many Phoenician names - Hannibal, Asdrubal, Adherbal, Belus, etc. - are derived from Baal." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:14-23 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The account of this development of the covenant nation, which commenced after the death of Joshua and his contemporaries, is attached to the book of Joshua by a simple repetition of the closing verses of that book (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-28.htm">Joshua 24:28-31</a>) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6-10</a>, with a few unimportant differences, not only to form a link between Josha and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>, and to resume the thread of the history which was broken off by the summary just given of the results of the wars between the Israelites and Canaanites (Bertheau), but rather to bring out sharply and clearly the contrast between the age that was past and the period of the Israelitish history that was just about to commence. The vav consec. attached to &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; expresses the order of thought and not of time. The apostasy of the new generation from the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>.) was a necessary consequence of the attitude of Israel to the Canaanites who were left in the land, as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1-2:5</a>. This thought is indicated by the vav consec. in &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;; so that the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6</a>. as expressed in our ordinary phraseology would be as follows: Now when Joshua had dismissed the people, and the children of Israel had gone every one to his own inheritance to take possession of the land, the people served the Lord as long as Joshua and the elders who survived him were alive; but when Joshua was dead, and that generation (which was contemporaneous with him) had been gathered to its fathers, there rose up another generation after them which knew not the Lord, and also (knew not) the work which He had done to Israel. On the death and burial of Joshua, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29-30</a>. "Gathered unto their fathers" corresponds to "gathered to his people" in the Pentateuch (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-17.htm">Genesis 25:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>, etc.: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>). They "knew not the Lord," sc., from seeing or experiencing His wonderful deeds, which the contemporaries of Joshua and Moses had seen and experienced.<p>In the general survey of the times of the judges, commencing at <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>, the falling away of the Israelites from the Lord is mentioned first of all, and at the same time it is distinctly shown how neither the chastisements inflicted upon them by God at the hands of hostile nations, nor the sending of judges to set them free from the hostile oppression, availed to turn them from their idolatry (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). This is followed by the determination of God to tempt and chastise the sinful nation by not driving away the remaining Canaanites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-20.htm">Judges 2:20-23</a>); and lastly, the account concludes with an enumeration of the tribes that still remained, and the attitude of Israel towards them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-6</a>). </body></html>
