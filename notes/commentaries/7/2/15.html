The nation made themselves as mean and miserable by forsaking God, as they would have been great and happy if they had continued faithful to him. Their punishment answered to the evil they had done. They served the gods of the nations round about them, even the meanest, and God made them serve the princes of the nations round about them, even the meanest. Those who have found God true to his promises, may be sure that he will be as true to his threatenings. He might in justice have abandoned them, but he could not for pity do it. The Lord was with the judges when he raised them up, and so they became saviours. In the days of the greatest distress of the church, there shall be some whom God will find or make fit to help it. The Israelites were not thoroughly reformed; so mad were they upon their idols, and so obstinately bent to backslide. Thus those who have forsaken the good ways of God, which they have once known and professed, commonly grow most daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts hardened. Their punishment was, that the Canaanites were spared, and so they were beaten with their own rod. Men cherish and indulge their corrupt appetites and passions; therefore God justly leaves them to themselves, under the power of their sins, which will be their ruin. God has told us how deceitful and desperately wicked our hearts are, but we are not willing to believe it, until by making bold with temptation we find it true by sad experience. We need to examine how matters stand with ourselves, and to pray without ceasing, that we may be rooted and grounded in love, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Let us declare war against every sin, and follow after holiness all our days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Consult the marginal references.

The vav consec. attached to &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; expresses the order of thought and not of time. The apostasy of the new generation from the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>.) was a necessary consequence of the attitude of Israel to the Canaanites who were left in the land, as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1-2:5</a>. This thought is indicated by the vav consec. in &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;; so that the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm">Judges 2:6</a>. as expressed in our ordinary phraseology would be as follows: Now when Joshua had dismissed the people, and the children of Israel had gone every one to his own inheritance to take possession of the land, the people served the Lord as long as Joshua and the elders who survived him were alive; but when Joshua was dead, and that generation (which was contemporaneous with him) had been gathered to its fathers, there rose up another generation after them which knew not the Lord, and also (knew not) the work which He had done to Israel. On the death and burial of Joshua, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29-30</a>. "Gathered unto their fathers" corresponds to "gathered to his people" in the Pentateuch (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-17.htm">Genesis 25:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>, etc.: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>). They "knew not the Lord," sc., from seeing or experiencing His wonderful deeds, which the contemporaries of Joshua and Moses had seen and experienced.<p>In the general survey of the times of the judges, commencing at <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>, the falling away of the Israelites from the Lord is mentioned first of all, and at the same time it is distinctly shown how neither the chastisements inflicted upon them by God at the hands of hostile nations, nor the sending of judges to set them free from the hostile oppression, availed to turn them from their idolatry (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). This is followed by the determination of God to tempt and chastise the sinful nation by not driving away the remaining Canaanites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-20.htm">Judges 2:20-23</a>); and lastly, the account concludes with an enumeration of the tribes that still remained, and the attitude of Israel towards them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-6</a>). </body></html>
