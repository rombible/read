Hence from very ancient times these words have been interpreted as, “a messenger of the Lord” (as in the margin of our Bible). The Targum paraphrases it by “a prophet with a message from Jehovah.” R. Tanchum, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm" title="And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.">Judges 2:6</a>, infers that it was Joshua himself. Kimchi and others have supposed that it was Phinehas. No indications are given of anything specially miraculous. On the other hand, there is much room to suppose that the writer intended “the Angel of the Presence,” because ( 1 ) he constantly uses the phrase in this sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/6-11.htm" title="And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.">Judges 6:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/6-21.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.">Judges 6:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, you are barren, and bore not: but you shall conceive, and bear a son.">Judges 13:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-13.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.">Judges 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-15.htm" title="And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.">Judges 13:15</a>, &c.); (2) the same phrase occurs in this sense elsewhere, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.">Genesis 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-2.htm" title="And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.">Exodus 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm" title="And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.">Exodus 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm" title="And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.">Exodus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.">Numbers 22:22</a>, &c; (3) the angel speaks in the first person, and does not introduce his words by “Thus saith Jehovah,” as the prophets always do (but see below). It seems probable, therefore, that by “the angel of the Lord” the writer meant “the captain of the Lord’s host,” who appeared to Joshua at Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13-15</a>). Against this conclusion may be urged the fact that in no other instance does an angel appear to, or preach to, multitudes. Angels are sent to individuals, but prophets to nations.<p><span class= "bld">Came up from Gilgal to Bochim.</span>—This notice is by no means <span class= "ital">decisive </span>against the conclusion that an angel is intended. The writer may mean to intimate that the Angel Prince of the host (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-20.htm" title="Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.">Exodus 23:20-23</a>), the Angel of the Covenant, left his station in the camp of Gilgal and came up to the new camp or assembly of the people in Central Palestine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm" title="And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.">Joshua 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/5-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Why the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.">Joshua 5:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm" title="So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.">Joshua 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-15.htm" title="And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.">Joshua 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm" title="Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm" title="Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.">Joshua 14:6</a>). Ha-Bochim means “the weepers.” The locality is not known, but the LXX. render it “to the weeping-place,” and add “and to Bethel, and to the House of Israel.” Hence it has been inferred that Bochim was near Bethel. Possibly however, the LXX. may have been led to this interpretation by the vicinity to Bethel of Allon-Bachuth, “the oak of weeping” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm" title="But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.">Genesis 35:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And said, I made you to go up out of Egypt.</span>—The LXX. have “the Lord, the Lord brought you out of Egypt” (Cod. Alex.). Houbigant, from the repetition of the word, precariously conjectures the loss of some words, “<span class= "ital">Thus saith the Lord, </span>I the Lord,” &c., as in the Peshito; and, indeed, in some MSS. a blank (<span class= "ital">Piska</span>) is left, implying at least a suspicion that this formula has accidentally fallen out of the text.<p><span class= "bld">I will never break my covenant with you.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm" title="And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you, and to your seed after you.">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-12.htm" title="And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.">Genesis 29:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-28.htm" title="My mercy will I keep for him for ever more, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.">Psalm 89:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-34.htm" title="My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.">Psalm 89:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-54.htm" title="He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;">Luke 1:54-55</a>, &c; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/3-6.htm" title="Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

The first part of this passage {<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Jdg 2:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-5.htm" title="And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD.">Jdg 2:5</a>} belongs to the former, and closes it; the second {<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm" title="And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.">Jdg 2:6</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm" title="And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.">Jdg 2:10</a>} introduces the latter, and contrasts it with the state of things prevailing as long as the soldiers of Joshua lived.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">I. ‘</span>The Angel of the Lord’ had appeared to Joshua in Gilgal at the beginning of the war, and issued his orders as ‘Captain of the Lord’s host.’ Now He reappears to ask why his orders had not been carried out, and to announce that victory was no longer to attend Israel’s arms. Nothing can be plainer than that the Angel speaks as one in whom the divine name dwells. His reiterated ‘I’s’ are incomprehensible on any other hypothesis than that He is that mysterious person, distinct from and yet one with Jehovah, whom we know as the ‘Word made flesh.’ His words here are stern. He enumerates the favours which He had showed to Israel, and which should have inspired them to glad obedience. He recalls the conditions on which they had received the land; namely, that they were to enter into no entangling alliances with the remnant of the inhabitants, and especially to have no tolerance for their idolatry. Here we may observe that, according to Joshua’s last charge, the extermination of the native peoples was not contemplated, but that there should be no such alliances as would peril Israel’s observance of the covenant {<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-7.htm" title="That you come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:">Joshua 23:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm" title="Else if you do in any wise go back, and join to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you:">Joshua 23:12</a>}. He charges them with disobedience, and asks the same question as had been asked of Eve, ‘What is this ye have done?’ And He declares the punishment about to follow, in the paralysing of Israel’s conquering arm by the withdrawal of His conquering might, and in the seductions from the native inhabitants to which they would fall victims.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note, then, how God’s benefits aggravate our disobedience, and how He bases His right to command on them. Further, note how His promises are contingent on our fulfilment of their conditions, and how a covenant which He has sworn that He will never break He does count as non-existent when men break it. Again, observe the sharp arraignment of the faithless, and the forcing of them to bethink themselves of the true character of their deeds, or, if we adopt the Revised Version’s rendering, of the unreasonableness of departing from God. No man dare answer when God asks, ‘What hast thou done?’ No man can answer reasonably when He asks, ‘Why hast thou done it?’ Once more, note that His servants sin when they allow themselves to be so mixed up with the world that they are in peril of learning its ways and getting a snare to their souls. We have all unconquered ‘Canaanites’ in our hearts, and amity with them is supreme folly and crying wickedness. ‘Thorough’ must be our motto. Many times have the conquered overcome their conquerors, as in Rome’s conquest of Greece, the Goths’ conquest of Rome, the Normans’ conquest of England. Israel was in some respects conquered by Canaanites and other conquered tribes. Let us take care that we are not overcome by our inward foes, whom we fancy we have subdued and can afford to treat leniently.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Again, God punishes our making truce with our spiritual foes by letting the effects of the truce work themselves out. He said to Israel, in effect: ‘If you make alliances with the people of the land, you shall no longer have power to cast them out. The swift rush of the stream of victory shall be stayed. You have chosen to make them your friends, and their friendship shall produce its natural effects, of tempting you to imitation.’ The increased power of our unsubdued evils is the punishment, as it is the result, of tolerance of them. We wanted to keep them, and dreamed that we could control them. Keep them we shall, control them we cannot. They will master us if we do not expel them. No wonder that the place was named Bochim {‘Weepers’}, when such stern words were thundered forth. Tears flow easily; and many a sin is wept for once, and afterwards repeated often. So it was with Israel, as the narrative goes on to tell. Let us take the warning, and give heed to make repentance deep and lasting.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">II.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm" title="And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.">Jdg 2:6</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm" title="And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.">Jdg 2:10</a> go back to an earlier period than the appearance of the Angel. We do not know how long the survivors of the conquering army lived in sufficient numbers to leaven opinion and practice. We may, however, roughly calculate that the youngest of these would be about twenty when the war began, and that about fifty years would see the end of the host that had crossed Jordan and stormed Jericho. If Joshua was of about the same age as Caleb, he would be about eighty at the beginning of the conquest, and lived thirty years afterwards, so that about twenty years after his death would be the limit of ‘the elders that outlived Joshua.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm" title="And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.">Jdg 2:6</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm" title="And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.">Jdg 2:9</a> substantially repeat <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-28.htm" title="So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance.">Joshua 24:28</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-31.htm" title="And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.">Joshua 24:31</a>, and are here inserted to mark not only the connection with the former book, but to indicate the beginning of a new epoch. The facts narrated in this paragraph are but too sadly in accord with the uniform tendencies of our poor weak nature. As long as some strong personality leads a nation or a church, it keeps true to its early fervour. The first generation which has lived through some great epoch, when God’s arm has been made bare, retains the impression of His power. But when the leader falls, it is like withdrawing a magnet, and the heap of iron filings tumbles back to the ground inert. Think of the post-Apostolic age of the Church, of Germany in the generation after Luther, not to come nearer home, and we must see that Israel’s experience was an all but universal one. It is hard to keep a community even of professing Christians on the high level. No great cause is ever launched which does not lose ‘way’ as it continues. ‘Having begun in the Spirit,’ all such are too apt to continue ‘in the flesh.’ The original impulses wane, friction begins to tell. Custom clogs the wheels. The fiery lava-stream cools and slackens. So it always has been. Therefore God has to change His instruments, and churches need to be shaken up, and sometimes broken up, ‘lest one good,’ when it has degenerated into ‘custom,’ should ‘corrupt the world.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But we shall miss the lesson here taught if we do not apply it to tendencies in ourselves, and humbly recognise that we are in danger of being ‘hindered,’ however ‘well’ we may have begun to ‘run,’ and that our only remedy is to renew continually our first-hand vision of ‘the great works of the Lord,’ and our consecration to His service. It is a poor affair if, like Israel, our devotion to God depends on Joshua’s life, or, like King Joash, we do that which is ‘right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Jdg 2:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">An angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal — </span>This, no doubt, was the Angel of the covenant, the same divine being that appeared to Joshua near Jericho, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?...">Joshua 5:13-14</a>; to whom the conduct of Israel out of Egypt into Canaan, and their conquests and success there, are frequently ascribed.

And, having assumed the shape of a man, he imitates the motion of a man, and appears to come from Gilgal to the place where they now were, probably in order to remind the Israelites of his appearing to Joshua near that place, of the assurance he then gave them of his intended presence with them in the conquest of the country, and of the solemn covenant they made with him by the renewal of circumcision.

God sets forth what he had done for Israel, and what he had promised. Those who throw off communion with God, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, know not what they do now, and will have nothing to say for themselves in the day of account shortly. They must expect to suffer for this their folly. Those deceive themselves who expect advantages from friendship with God's enemies. God often makes men's sin their punishment; and thorns and snares are in the way of the froward, who will walk contrary to God. The people wept, crying out against their own folly and ingratitude. They trembled at the word, and not without cause. It is a wonder sinners can ever read the Bible with dry eyes. Had they kept close to God and their duty, no voice but that of singing had been heard in their congregation; but by their sin and folly they made other work for themselves, and nothing is to be heard but the voice of weeping. The worship of God, in its own nature, is joy, praise, and thanksgiving; our sins alone render weeping needful. It is pleasing to see men weep for their sins; but our tears, prayers, and even amendment, cannot atone for sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The angel of the Lord (not an angel). - The phrase is used nearly 60 times to designate the Angel of God's presence. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> note. In all cases where "the angel of the Lord" delivers a message, he does it as if God Himself were speaking, without the intervening words "Thus saith the Lord," which are used in the case of prophets.

An Angel Sent to Rebuke the People at Bochim.<p>1-3. an angel &#8230; came from Gilgal to Bochim&#8212;We are inclined to think, from the authoritative tone of his language, that he was the Angel of the Covenant (Ex 23:20; Jos 5:14); the same who appeared in human form and announced himself captain of the Lord's host. His coming from Gilgal had a peculiar significance, for there the Israelites made a solemn dedication of themselves to God on their entrance into the promised land [Jos 4:1-9]; and the memory of that religious engagement, which the angel's arrival from Gilgal awakened, gave emphatic force to his rebuke of their apostasy.<p>Bochim&#8212;"the weepers," was a name bestowed evidently in allusion to this incident or the place, which was at or near Shiloh.<p>I said, I will never break my covenant with you &#8230; but ye have not obeyed my voice&#8212;The burden of the angel's remonstrance was that God would inviolably keep His promise; but they, by their flagrant and repeated breaches of their covenant with Him, had forfeited all claim to the stipulated benefits.

The latter verses were probably composed by the post-exilic editor who introduced ch. 1 into its present place, not by the author of the Introduction <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm" title="And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.">Jdg 2:6</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-6.htm" title="And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.">Jdg 3:6</a>; contrast, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm" title="Why I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.">Jdg 2:3</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-22.htm" title="That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.">Jdg 2:22</a> f., and again with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/3-1.htm" title="Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;...">Jdg 3:1-3</a>. The appeal to past history, and the tone of remonstrance upbraiding Israel’s neglect to exterminate the Canaanites, betray the later historian. Most of the phrases in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Jdg 2:1</a></span> b–5a are borrowed from earlier writings.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An angel of the Lord</span>.

Sic., and Pliny, and was afterwards named Ptolemais from one of the Ptolemys (1 Macc. 5:15, 21; 10:1, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-7.htm">Acts 21:7</a>). The Arabs called it Akka, and this was corrupted by the crusaders into Acker or Acre. During the crusades it was a very flourishing maritime and commercial town; but it subsequently fell into decay, and at the present time has a population of about 5000, composed of Mussulmans, Druses, and Christians (see C. v. Raumer, Pal. p. 119; Rob. Bibl. Res.; and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 725ff.). Sidon, now Saida: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>.

As seven out of the twenty-two towns of Asher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-30.htm">Joshua 19:30</a>) remained in the hands of the Canaanites, including such important places as Acco and Sidon, it is not stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-32.htm">Judges 1:32</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>, that "the Canaanites dwelt among them," but that "the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites," to show that the Canaanites held the upper hand.
