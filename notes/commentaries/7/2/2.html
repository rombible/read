God sets forth what he had done for Israel, and what he had promised. Those who throw off communion with God, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, know not what they do now, and will have nothing to say for themselves in the day of account shortly. They must expect to suffer for this their folly. Those deceive themselves who expect advantages from friendship with God's enemies. God often makes men's sin their punishment; and thorns and snares are in the way of the froward, who will walk contrary to God. The people wept, crying out against their own folly and ingratitude. They trembled at the word, and not without cause. It is a wonder sinners can ever read the Bible with dry eyes. Had they kept close to God and their duty, no voice but that of singing had been heard in their congregation; but by their sin and folly they made other work for themselves, and nothing is to be heard but the voice of weeping. The worship of God, in its own nature, is joy, praise, and thanksgiving; our sins alone render weeping needful. It is pleasing to see men weep for their sins; but our tears, prayers, and even amendment, cannot atone for sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The two articles of the covenant here specified (compare margin references) are those which the Israelites had at this time broken.

An Angel Sent to Rebuke the People at Bochim.<p>1-3. an angel &#8230; came from Gilgal to Bochim&#8212;We are inclined to think, from the authoritative tone of his language, that he was the Angel of the Covenant (Ex 23:20; Jos 5:14); the same who appeared in human form and announced himself captain of the Lord's host. His coming from Gilgal had a peculiar significance, for there the Israelites made a solemn dedication of themselves to God on their entrance into the promised land [Jos 4:1-9]; and the memory of that religious engagement, which the angel's arrival from Gilgal awakened, gave emphatic force to his rebuke of their apostasy.<p>Bochim&#8212;"the weepers," was a name bestowed evidently in allusion to this incident or the place, which was at or near Shiloh.<p>I said, I will never break my covenant with you &#8230; but ye have not obeyed my voice&#8212;The burden of the angel's remonstrance was that God would inviolably keep His promise; but they, by their flagrant and repeated breaches of their covenant with Him, had forfeited all claim to the stipulated benefits. Having disobeyed the will of God by voluntarily courting the society of idolaters and placing themselves in the way of temptation, He left them to suffer the punishment of their misdeeds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Disobeyed these express commands of mine? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land,....

In the ancient narrative, ch. 1, Israel’s failure is due to inferiority in battle; here it is ascribed to neglect of religious duty. The command to refuse all alliances with the native inhabitants, and to drive them out, is found in the old legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-31.htm" title="And I will set your bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and you shall drive them out before you....">Exodus 23:31-33</a>, part of the ‘Book of the Covenant,’ and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:">Exodus 34:12</a> J), and thence incorporated into the Deuteronomic Code (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/7-2.htm" title="And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall smite them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:...">Deuteronomy 7:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm" title="And you shall consume all the people which the LORD your God shall deliver you; your eye shall have no pity on them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you.">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/12-29.htm" title="When the LORD your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go to possess them, and you succeed them, and dwell in their land;...">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/20-16.htm" title="But of the cities of these people, which the LORD your God does give you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes:...">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>). This law originated at a period, long after the original occupation of Canaan, when it could no longer be obeyed literally; it stood, therefore, for an ideal, and witnesses to an intense conviction of the distinctive character of Israel’s religion, and to the constant danger which threatened it from contact with the Canaanites. The Books of Kings and the prophets give ample evidence of the deteriorating effect of Canaanite influences; and it is to be noted that the Codes which deal with this topic belong to the period before the exile.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Asher did not root out those in Acco, etc. Acco: a seaport town to the north of Carmel, on the bay which is called by its name; it is called Ake by Josephus, Diod.
