Their Decree.<p>8-13. all the people arose as one man&#8212;The extraordinary unanimity that prevailed shows, that notwithstanding great disorders had broken out in many parts, the people were sound at the core; and remembering their national covenant with God, they now felt the necessity of wiping out so foul a stain on their character as a people. It was resolved that the inhabitants of Gibeah should be subjected to condign punishment. But the resolutions were conditional. For as the common law of nature and nations requires that an inquiry should be made and satisfaction demanded, before committing an act of hostility or vengeance, messengers were despatched through the whole territory of Benjamin, demanding the immediate surrender or execution of the delinquents. The request was just and reasonable; and by refusing it the Benjamites virtually made themselves a party in the quarrel. It must not be supposed that the people of this tribe were insensible or indifferent to the atrocious character of the crime that had been committed on their soil. But their patriotism or their pride was offended by the hostile demonstration of the other tribes. The passions were inflamed on both sides; but certainly the Benjamites incurred an awful responsibility by the attitude of resistance they assumed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That they may do according to all the folly that they have wrought; </span> that we may punish them as such a wickedness deserves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In Israel:</span> this is added as an aggravation, that they should do that in Israel, or among God’s peculiar people, which was esteemed abominable even among the heathen. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And we will take ten men of an hundred, throughout all the tribes of Israel,....

We are reminded of the circumstantial diffuseness of P, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-2.htm" title="Take you the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls;">Numbers 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-20.htm" title="And the children of Reuben, Israel's oldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;">Numbers 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-22.htm" title="Of the children of Simeon, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, those that were numbered of them, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;">Numbers 1:22</a> etc.; see Driver, <span class="ital">Introd</span>, p. 130. The style of the verse is remarkably poor; e.g. the single prep. <span class="ital">lamedh</span> = <span class="ital">to</span> is used nine times in a variety of senses; and the text is corrupt. The rendering <span class="ital">that they may do when they come</span> smooths over the awkwardness of the Hebr. The LXX. cod. A suggests a slight change and transposes the words, reading <span class="ital">for the people that come to do to G.</span> etc. The trouble lies in the expression <span class="ital">for when they come</span> (or <span class="ital">that come</span>); Moore and Budde would omit it as a gloss on <span class="ital">the people</span>; indeed there is no other way of obtaining a satisfactory sentence. The connexion is much improved by transposing the two halves of the <span class="ital">v.</span> and connecting with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-9.htm" title="But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;">Jdg 20:9</a></span> : <span class="ital">we will go up against it by lot, to do to G. of B. according to … in Israel; and we will take ten men … to fetch victual for the people</span> (Moore). <span class="ital">Geba</span> (see marg.) is a mistake for <span class="ital">Gibeah</span>, cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-33.htm" title="And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.">Jdg 20:33</a></span>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, described the whole affair. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, the owners or citizens of Gibeah (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>).
