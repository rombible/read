The technical term (not, however, found in Samuel and Kings, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>) for the whole Israelitish people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1, 2, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-15.htm">Leviticus 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">From Dan to Beersheba</span>. Dan, or Laish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>), being the northernmost point, and Beersheba (now <span class="accented">Bir-es-saba</span>, the springs so called) in the south of Judah the southernmost. It cannot be inferred with certainty from this expression that the Danite occupation of Laish had taken place at this time, though it may have done so, because we do not know when this narrative was written, and the phrase is only used as a proverbial expression familiar in the writer's time. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Gilead</span>. In its widest sense, meaning the whole of trans-Jordanic Israel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-8.htm">Judges 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>, etc.). Mizpeh, or, as it is always written in Hebrew, <span class="accented">ham-Mizpeh</span>, with the article (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1</a>). The Mizpeh here mentioned is not the same as the Mizpeh of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11, 29, 34</a>, which was in Gilead, but was situated in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>). That it was a national place of meeting in the time of Samuel is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-12</a>, and we learn from ver. 16 of that same chapter that it was one of the places to which Samuel went on circuit. We find it a place of national meeting also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17</a>, and even so late as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-23.htm">2 Kings 25:23</a>, and in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 3:46). Its vicinity to Shiloh, where the tabernacle was, was probably one reason why it was made a centre to the whole congregation (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17, 22, 25</a>).
