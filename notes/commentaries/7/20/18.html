Apparently the high priest was not prevented by any scruple from taking the ephod, with its jewelled breastplate and Urim and Thummim, to any place where its use was needed. The ark was similarly carried from place to place, and had been brought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-27.htm" title="And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,">Judges 20:27</a>) to the venerable sanctuary of Bethel with the high priest.

At this time the ark was at Bethel (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>), and not at Shiloh. It is not unlikely that though Shiloh was the chief residence of the ark <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>, yet the tabernacle, being moveable, was, either at stated times, or as occasion required, moved to where the Judge resided, or the congregation assembled (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). On the present occasion the ark may have been moved to Bethel for the convenience of proximity to the great national council at Mizpeh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 20:18-28. The Israelites Lose Forty Thousand.<p>18-28. the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God&#8212;This consultation at Shiloh was right. But they ought to have done it at the commencement of their proceedings. Instead of this, all their plans were formed, and never doubting, it would seem, that the war was just and inevitable, the only subject of their inquiry related to the precedency of the tribes&#8212;a point which it is likely was discussed in the assembly. Had they asked counsel of God sooner, their expedition would have been conducted on a different principle&#8212;most probably by reducing the number of fighting men, as in the case of Gideon's army. As it was, the vast number of volunteers formed an excessive and unwieldy force, unfit for strenuous and united action against a small, compact, and well-directed army. A panic ensued, and the confederate tribes, in two successive engagements, sustained great losses. These repeated disasters (notwithstanding their attack on Benjamin had been divinely authorized) overwhelmed them with shame and sorrow. Led to reflection, they became sensible of their guilt in not repressing their national idolatries, as well as in too proudly relying on their superior numbers and the precipitate rashness of this expedition. Having humbled themselves by prayer and fasting, as well as observed the appointed method of expiating their sins, they were assured of acceptance as well as of victory. The presence and services of Phinehas on this occasion help us to ascertain the chronology thus far, that the date of the occurrence must be fixed shortly after the death of Joshua.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The children of Israel, </span> i.e. some sent in the name of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To the house of God, </span> to wit, to Shiloh, which was not far from Mizpeh, where they were. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which of us shall go up first to the battle?</span> this they ask to prevent emulations and contentions; but they do not ask whether they should go against them, or no, for that they knew they ought to do by the will of God already revealed.

In following this precedent the Israelites put the men of Gibeah on the footing of the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. With reference to ver. 9, it is worth considering whether this is not the fulfilment of the purpose there expressed by the Israelites, to go up against Gibeah <span class="accented">by lot</span>; either by understanding that the answer asked was given by a Divinely-directed <span class="accented">lot</span>, according to which Judah's turn came first (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24-26</a>; etc.), or by taking the expression <span class="accented">by lot</span> in a wider sense, as meaning generally Divine direction. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Before the tribes of Israel entered upon the war, they sent men to all the tribes of Benjamin, who were to demand that the culprits in Gibeah should be given up to be punished, that the evil might thus be exterminated from Israel, according to the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a> as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-12.htm">Judges 17:12</a>. "The tribes of Benjamin" are the same as "the families of Benjamin:" the historian pictured to himself the different divisions of the tribe of Benjamin as warlike powers about to carry on a war with the other tribes of Israel. The word shebet (tribe) is used in a different way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-18.htm">Numbers 4:18</a>. But the Benjaminites would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the other tribes of Israel. The Keri (sons of Benjamin) is a needless alteration, since Benjamin may be construed with the plural as a collective term. By refusing this just demand on the part of the other tribes, the Benjaminites took the side of the culprits in Gibeah, and compelled the congregation to make war upon the whole tribe. </body></html>
