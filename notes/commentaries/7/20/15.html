We see generally that the Benjamites, like the rest of the Israelites, in spite of their exceptional increase in the wilderness, had been now diminished by about a third since the last census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-41.htm" title="These are the sons of Benjamin after their families: and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and six hundred.">Numbers 26:41</a>).

This diminution seems to indicate disturbed and harassing times. With this agrees the mention of the cities, as containing the whole Benjamite population. The inference is that the open country and unwalled villages were not safe, but that the Benjamites kept the Canaanites in subjection only by dwelling in fortified towns.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-17. the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah&#8212;Allowing their valor to be ever so great, nothing but blind passion and unbending obstinacy could have impelled them to take the field against their brethren with such a disparity of numbers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Object.</span> This agrees not with the following numbers; for all that were slain of Benjamin were 25,100 men, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-35.htm" title="And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.">Judges 20:35</a></span>, and there were only 600 that survived, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-47.htm" title="But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and stayed in the rock Rimmon four months.">Judges 20:47</a></span>, which make only 25,700. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> The other thousand men were either left in some of their cities, where they were slain, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm" title="And the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.">Judges 20:48</a></span>, or were cut off in the two first battles, wherein it is reasonable to think they had an unbloody victory; and as for these 25,100 men, they were all slain in that day, i.e. the day of the third battle, as is affirmed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-35.htm" title="And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.">Judges 20:35</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities,....

Josephus (g) makes the number of the Benjaminites still less, no more than 25,600, led thereunto by an later account, that 25,000 Benjaminites were slain in the third and last battle, and only six hundred escaped to a rock for safety, not considering that 1000 men may well be supposed to be lost in the two first battles; for it would be strange indeed that they should lose none in two engagement with so large an army; the same error is committed in the Vulgate Latin version, which makes them no more than 25,000; with which agrees the Alexandrian copy of the Septuagint version: though that, according to the Vatican exemplar, has but 23,000.

The figures in this account are inconsistent.

Some mss. of the LXX (cod.

The words can hardly be original in both places, and the Versions agree in giving them only once. Probably they should be omitted here, and the verse ended with <span class="ital">the inhabitants of Gibeah</span>; the insertion of <span class="ital">were numbered</span> would be required when the following words were added.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and six thousand</span>. The numbers of Benjamin in the wilderness were at the first numbering 35,400, and at the second 45,600 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-36.htm">Numbers 1:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-23.htm">Numbers 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-41.htm">Numbers 26:41</a>). It is impossible to account with certainty for the falling off in the numbers by so many as near 20,000; but perhaps many were slain in the wars of Canaan, and the unsettled times were unfavourable to early marriages. For the whole of Israel there was, as appeared by ver. 2, note, a falling off of nearly 200,000 men, or, to speak exactly (601,730-400,000 +26,700), of 175,030. <span class="cmt_word">Which were numbered</span>. There is some obscurity in this latter clause; but, in spite of the accents being opposed to it, the A.V. seems certainly right. The rendering acording to the accents, "they (the Benjamites) were numbered, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, seven hundred chosen men," makes no sense, and does not explain who the 700 were. The population of Gibeah would be about 5 &times; 700, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 3500, according to this statement. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then all the people rose up as one man, saying, "We will not any of us go into his tent, neither will we any of us return to his house," sc., till this crime is punished. The sentence follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9</a> : "This is the thing that we will do," i.e., this is the way in which we will treat Gibeah: "against it by lot" (sc., we will act). The Syriac gives the sense correctly - We will cast lots upon it; but the lxx quite erroneously supply &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; (we will go up); and in accordance with this, many expositors connect the words with <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a> in the following sense: "We will choose one man out of every ten by lot, to supply the army with the necessary provision during the expedition." This is quite a mistake, because in this way a subordinate point, which only comes into consideration in connection with the execution of the sentence, would be made the chief point, and the sentence itself would not be given at all. The words "against it by lot" contain the resolution that was formed concerning the sinful town, and have all the enigmatical brevity of judicial sentences, and are to be explained from the course laid down in the Mosaic law with regard to the Canaanites, who were to be exterminated, and their land divided by lot among the Israelites. Consequently the meaning is simply this: "Let us proceed with the lot against Gibeah," i.e., let us deal with it as with the towns of the Canaanites, conquer it, lay it in ashes, and distribute its territory by lot. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a> a subordinate circumstance is mentioned, which was necessary to enable them to carry out the resolution that had been made. As the assembled congregation had determined to keep together for the purpose of carrying on war (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-8.htm">Judges 20:8</a>), it was absolutely necessary that resources should be provided for those who were actively engaged in the war. For this purpose they chose one man in every ten "to fetch provision for the people," &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, "that they might do on their coming to Gibeah of Benjamin according to all the folly which had been done in Israel," i.e., might punish the wickedness in Gibeah as it deserved.</body></html>
