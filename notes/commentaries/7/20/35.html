If written consecutively, and not compiled, the writer must have been one whose method bore the same resemblance to that of later writers, as the style of Hellanicus did to that of Herodotus and Thucydides. It is the style to which Roman writers would have applied the epithet <span class= "ital">inconditus</span>—the style of the oldest annals. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/20-36.htm" title="So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.">Judges 20:36-46</a> are not, as has been conjectured by some writers, <span class= "ital">necessarily </span>a different account of the battle, but contain a loose assemblage of details, which has been added to explain the general result.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door.

According to its etymology, it ought to mean a "bare open place", which is particularly unsuitable for an ambush. However, by a change in the vowel-points, without any alteration in the letters, it becomes the common word for "a cavern". <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men&#8212;This was a third division, different both from the ambuscade and the army, who were fighting at Baal-tamar.
