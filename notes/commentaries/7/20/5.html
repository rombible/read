This was so far true that it is likely he was in fear of his life; but he doubtless shaped his narrative so as to conceal his own cowardice in the transaction. We have a similar example of an unfaithful narration of facts in the letter of Claudius Lysias to Felix (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-27.htm">Acts 23:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The men of Gibeah</span>.

Give ye heed to it (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1500;&#1489; &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;); make up your minds and say on, i.e., decide how this unparalleled wickedness is to be punished. Sending the dissected pieces of the corpse to the tribes was a symbolical act, by which the crime committed upon the murdered woman was placed before the eyes of the whole nation, to summon it to punish the crime, and was naturally associated with a verbal explanation of the matter by the bearer of the pieces. See the analogous proceeding on the part of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-7.htm">1 Samuel 11:7</a>), and the Scythian custom related by Lucian in Toxaris, c. 48, that whoever was unable to procure satisfaction for an injury that he had received, cut an ox in pieces and sent it round, whereupon all who were willing to help him to obtain redress took a piece, and swore that they would stand by him to the utmost of their strength. The perfects &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; - &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-30.htm">Judges 19:30</a>) are not used for the imperfects c. vav consec. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; - &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, as Hitzig supposes, but as simple perfects (perfecta conseq.), expressing the result which the Levite expected from his conduct; and we have simply to supply &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; before &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, which is often omitted in lively narrative or animated conversation (compare, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-5.htm">Exodus 8:5</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>). The perfects are used by the historian instead of imperfects with a simple vav, which are commonly employed in clauses indicating intention, "because what he foresaw would certainly take place, floated before his mind as a thing already done" (Rosenmller). The moral indignation, which the Levite expected on the part of all the tribes at such a crime as this, and their resolution to avenge it, are thereby exhibited not merely as an uncertain conjecture, but a fact that was sure to occur, and concerning which, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a> clearly shows, he had not deceived himself. </body></html>
