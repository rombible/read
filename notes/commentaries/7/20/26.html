The Israelites Lose Forty Thousand.<p>18-28. the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God&#8212;This consultation at Shiloh was right. But they ought to have done it at the commencement of their proceedings. Instead of this, all their plans were formed, and never doubting, it would seem, that the war was just and inevitable, the only subject of their inquiry related to the precedency of the tribes&#8212;a point which it is likely was discussed in the assembly. Had they asked counsel of God sooner, their expedition would have been conducted on a different principle&#8212;most probably by reducing the number of fighting men, as in the case of Gideon's army. As it was, the vast number of volunteers formed an excessive and unwieldy force, unfit for strenuous and united action against a small, compact, and well-directed army. A panic ensued, and the confederate tribes, in two successive engagements, sustained great losses. These repeated disasters (notwithstanding their attack on Benjamin had been divinely authorized) overwhelmed them with shame and sorrow. Led to reflection, they became sensible of their guilt in not repressing their national idolatries, as well as in too proudly relying on their superior numbers and the precipitate rashness of this expedition. Having humbled themselves by prayer and fasting, as well as observed the appointed method of expiating their sins, they were assured of acceptance as well as of victory. The presence and services of Phinehas on this occasion help us to ascertain the chronology thus far, that the date of the occurrence must be fixed shortly after the death of Joshua.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Sat there before the Lord, </span> and fasted; being now sensible of their former slightness, and now being truly humbled for their sins, which now they discover to be the true cause of their ill success. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Offered burnt-offerings, </span> to make atonement to God for their own sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Peace-offerings; </span> partly to bless God for sparing so many of them, whereas he might justly have cut off all of them when their brethren were slain; and partly to implore his assistance for the future, and to give him thanks for the victory, which now they were confident he would give them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then all the children of Israel and all the people went up, and came unto the house of God,....

The words in brackets give an interesting specimen of the theoretical treatment of history. To some later editor or scribe it seemed highly irregular that all Israel should offer sacrifices in any other place than the sanctuary of the ark. Accordingly the parenthesis explains that the ark in these days was at Beth-el! i.e. it must have been temporarily removed from Shiloh (Joshua 18 :1 P, 1 Samuel 4): and the sanctuary of the ark must have been served by the only legitimate priesthood (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-7.htm" title="And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;">Numbers 25:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-6.htm" title="And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.">Numbers 31:6</a> P). For a similar adaptation of ancient practice to later theory cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness....">2 Chronicles 1:3-6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1 Kings 3:4</a>.
