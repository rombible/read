The Israelites Lose Forty Thousand.<p>18-28. the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God&#8212;This consultation at Shiloh was right. But they ought to have done it at the commencement of their proceedings. Instead of this, all their plans were formed, and never doubting, it would seem, that the war was just and inevitable, the only subject of their inquiry related to the precedency of the tribes&#8212;a point which it is likely was discussed in the assembly. Had they asked counsel of God sooner, their expedition would have been conducted on a different principle&#8212;most probably by reducing the number of fighting men, as in the case of Gideon's army. As it was, the vast number of volunteers formed an excessive and unwieldy force, unfit for strenuous and united action against a small, compact, and well-directed army. A panic ensued, and the confederate tribes, in two successive engagements, sustained great losses. These repeated disasters (notwithstanding their attack on Benjamin had been divinely authorized) overwhelmed them with shame and sorrow. Led to reflection, they became sensible of their guilt in not repressing their national idolatries, as well as in too proudly relying on their superior numbers and the precipitate rashness of this expedition. Having humbled themselves by prayer and fasting, as well as observed the appointed method of expiating their sins, they were assured of acceptance as well as of victory. The presence and services of Phinehas on this occasion help us to ascertain the chronology thus far, that the date of the occurrence must be fixed shortly after the death of Joshua.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Inquired of the Lord, </span> to wit, by Urim and Thummim, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was there</span> in Shiloh, where they were now assembled. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Israel inquired of the Lord,....

In the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Asked the Lord</span>, as in vers. 18, 23. <span class="cmt_word">For the ark of the covenant</span>, etc. A most important statement, defining the time of these occurrences, within the lifetime of Phinehas, and also giving a strong intimation that the writer of these words lived after the tabernacle had been removed from Shiloh and its neighbourhood to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Was there</span>. Where? The natural answer to be given is, At Bethel; for Bethel is the only place that has been named. But it is not in accordance with the other intimations given us concerning the tabernacle, that Bethel should be its resting-place under the high priesthood of Phinehas. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a> we have the formal pitching of the tabernacle of the congregation at Shiloh; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-12.htm">Joshua 22:12</a> we find it there, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest before it; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>, we find it settled there till taken by the Philistines; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a> we find Shiloh described as the abode of the tabernacle till its capture by the Philistines, and there is no hint anywhere of Bethel or any other place having been the resting-place of the ark before it fell into the hands of the Philistines. Neither, again, is the explanation of some commentators, that the words <span class="accented">the ark</span>...  <span class="accented">was there in those days</span> implies "that the ark of the covenant was only temporarily at Bethel," at all satisfactory. <span class="accented">In those days</span> has naturally a much wider and broader application, like the expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), In <span class="accented">those days there was no king in Israel</span>, and contrasts the time of Phinehas and the judges with the times of the monarchy, when the ark and the high priest were at Jerusalem. Unless, therefore, we understand Bethel in vers. 18, 26, 31 to mean the house of God, which seems quite impossible, we must interpret the word <span class="accented">there</span> to mean Shiloh, and suppose that the writer took no count of the temporary removal to Bethel for the convenience of consultation, but considered that it was at Shiloh in one sense, though momentarily it was a few miles off. Possibly too in the fuller narrative, of which we have here the abridgment, the name of Shiloh was mentioned as that to which there referred. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As soon as the Israelites had posted themselves at Gibeah in battle array (&#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, to put in a row, or arrange the war or conflict, i.e., to put themselves in battle array, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-2.htm">1 Samuel 4:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2</a>, etc.), the Benjaminites came out and destroyed 22,000 men of Israel upon that day. &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;, to destroy to the earth, i.e., to lay dead upon the ground. </body></html>
