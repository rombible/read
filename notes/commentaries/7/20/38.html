For the word <span class= "ital">hereb </span>(which is an imperative) some MSS. read <span class= "ital">chereb, </span>“a sword,” and this is adopted by the LXX. (Cod. A). But the flash of a sword would not be seen at such a distance, and the word gives no good sense.

According to its etymology, it ought to mean a "bare open place", which is particularly unsuitable for an ambush. However, by a change in the vowel-points, without any alteration in the letters, it becomes the common word for "a cavern". <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men&#8212;This was a third division, different both from the ambuscade and the army, who were fighting at Baal-tamar.
