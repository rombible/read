The Benjaminites did not perceive this till the ambush fell upon their rear. But the ambush itself, as is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-37.htm">Judges 20:37</a> by way of further explanation, hastened and fell (fell as quickly as possible) into Gibeah, and went thither and smote the whole town with the edge of the sword. To this there is added the further explanation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a> : "And the arrangement of the Israelites with the ambush was this: multiply, to cause smoke-rising to ascend (i.e., cause a great cloud of smoke to ascend) out of the city." The only objection that can be raised to this view of &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;, as the imperative Hiphil of &#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, is the suffix &#1501;-attached to &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, since this is unsuitable to a direct address. This suffix can only be explained by supposing that there is an admixture of two constructions, the direct appeal, and the indirect explanation, that they were to cause to ascend. If this be not admitted, however, we can only follow Studer, and erase the suffix as an error of the pen occasioned by the following word &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;; for the other course suggested by Bertheau, namely that &#1492;&#1512;&#1489; should be struck out as a gloss, is precluded by the circumstance that there is no possible way of explaining the interpolation of so apparently unsuitable a word into the text. It certainly stood in the text used by the lxx, though they have most foolishly confounded &#1492;&#1512;&#1489; with &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, and rendered it &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;.</body></html>
