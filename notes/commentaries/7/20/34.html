But the result, the details of which are given at length in vers. 36-46, was that 25,100 Benjamites fell that day (see ver. 46). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Having made these preparations, they inquired of the Lord whether they should continue the war, and received this reply: "Go up (against Benjamin); for to-morrow I will give it unto thy hand" (&#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, the hand of the congregation carrying on the war). To this the supplementary remark is appended, that the ark of the covenant was at Bethel in those days, and the high priest served before it. The expression "in those days" implies that the ark of the covenant was only temporarily at Bethel, and therefore had been brought thither from the tabernacle at Shiloh during this war. </body></html>
