According to its etymology, it ought to mean a "bare open place", which is particularly unsuitable for an ambush. However, by a change in the vowel-points, without any alteration in the letters, it becomes the common word for "a cavern". <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men&#8212;This was a third division, different both from the ambuscade and the army, who were fighting at Baal-tamar.

While this was going on, the ambush of Israel broke forth from its position "from the plains of Geba." The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1492; to strip, denotes a naked region destitute of wood. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506; is the masculine form for &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;, and &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;&#1506; a more precise definition of &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;. This rendering, which is the one given in the Targum, certainly appears the simplest explanation of a word that has been rendered in very different ways, and which the lxx left untranslated as a proper name, &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;. The objection raised to this, viz., that a naked level country was not a place for an ambush, has no force, as there is no necessity to understand the words as signifying that the treeless country formed the actual hiding-place of the ambush; but the simple meaning is, that when the men broke from their hiding-place, they came from the treeless land towards the town. The rendering given by Rashi, Trem., and others, "on account of the tripping of Gibeah," is much less suitable, since, apart from the difficulty of taking &#1502;&#1503; in different senses so close together, we should at least expect to find &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (the city) instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;.</body></html>
