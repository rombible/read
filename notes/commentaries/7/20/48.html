There is something almost inconceivably horrible and appalling in the thought of thousands of poor women and innocent children ruthlessly butchered in cold blood in this internecine war between brother Israelites. The whole tribe were placed under the ban of extirpation, as though they had been Canaanites, just as mercilessly as Sihon and his people had been extirpated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm" title="And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:">Deuteronomy 2:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-15.htm" title="You shall surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.">Deuteronomy 13:15-16</a>), or Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-17.htm" title="And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.">Joshua 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-21.htm" title="And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.">Joshua 6:21</a>), or Ai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/8-25.htm" title="And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.">Joshua 8:25-26</a>). Their feelings were doubtless exasperated by the fearful destruction which Benjamin had inflicted upon them, as well as by religious horror at the conduct of the tribe; and for the rest, we can only say that <span class= "ital">“</span>the times of this ignorance God winked at.” The good side of the deed lies in its motive: it expressed an intense horror against moral pollution. The evil side lay in its ruthless savagery. In both aspects it agrees both with the recorded and the traditional character of Phinehas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm" title="And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly.

They fled therefore towards the north-east; but the battle had overtaken (reached or seized) them, and those out of the towns (had perished).
