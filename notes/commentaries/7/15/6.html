The latter seems to be most unlikely. Looking with despair and fury at the blackened fields which but a few days before had been thick with golden corn, it is inconceivable that the Philistines would be in a mood to perform an act of justice for the sake of the deadly enemy who had inflicted this loss upon them. Their motive is clear enough. They wished to insult and injure Samson, and, at the same time, vent their fierce spleen on the man whose family and whose conduct had led to all these troubles. That they thought about “burning as the punishment of adultery among the Jews” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-24.htm" title="And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter in law has played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by prostitution. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.">Genesis 38:24</a>, &c.) is still more improbable. To burn a person, and his house and his family, seems to have been the ordinary revenge of these barbarous days. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.">Judges 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take that we have? is it not so?">Judges 14:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-6.htm" title="Then the Philistines said, Who has done this?

In the means which Samson employed, we must look at the power of God supplying them, and making them successful, to mortify the pride and punish the wickedness of the Philistines. The Philistines threatened Samson's wife that they would burn her and her father's house. She, to save herself and oblige her countrymen, betrayed her husband; and the very thing that she feared, and by sin sought to avoid, came upon her! She, and her father's house, were burnt with fire, and by her countrymen, whom she thought to oblige by the wrong she did to her husband.

Who hath done this&#8212;The author of this outrage, and the cause that provoked such an extraordinary retaliation, soon became known; and the sufferers, enraged by the destruction of their crops, rushing with tumultuous fury to the house of Samson's wife, "burnt her and her father with fire."

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>. It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-24.htm">Genesis 38:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15, 25</a>, that burning with fire was a judicial punishment among the Hebrews. Possibly the Philistines, in their fear of Samson, and perhaps also from a rude sense of justice, inflicted this punishment upon the Thimnathite and her father as the real authors of the destruction of their corn-fields, by giving Samson so unheard-of provocation. Note the fact of the identical fate overtaking Samson's wife which she had sought to escape by base treachery (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a> with what actually happened). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And Samson's wife was given to his friend, whom he had chosen as a friend." &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; is not doubt to be understood here in the sense of "the friend of the bridegroom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>), &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (lxx), the conductor of the bride-namely, one of the thirty companions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-10.htm">Judges 14:10</a>), whom Samson had entrusted with this office at the marriage festival. The faithlessness of the Philistines towards the Israelites was no doubt apparent here; for even if Samson went home enraged at the treacherous behaviour of his wife, without taking her with him, he did not intend to break the marriage tie, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-1.htm">Judges 15:1-2</a> clearly shows. So that instead of looking at the wrong by which Samson felt himself aggrieved, and trying to mitigate his wrath, the parents of the woman made the breach irreparable by giving their daughter as a wife to his companion. </body></html>
