Samson’s exultation over his extraordinary achievement finds vent in a sort of punning couplet, which turns entirely on the identity of sound between <span class= "ital">chamor, </span>a heap, and <span class= "ital">chamor, </span>an ass, and the play of <span class= "ital">meaning </span>between <span class= "ital">aleph, </span>a thousand, and <span class= "ital">aleph, </span>an ox. In the Hebrew the couplet runs:—<p>“Bi-lechi <span class= "ital">ha-chamor chamor chamorathaim.</span><p>Bi-lechi <span class= "ital">ha-chamor </span>hicceythî <span class= "ital">eleph </span>eesh.”<p>Literally, with some attempt, however clumsy, to keep up the play of words,<p>“<span class= "ital">With jaw of the ass, a </span>(<span class= "ital">m</span>)<span class= "ital">ass two </span>(<span class= "ital">m</span>)<span class= "ital"> asses,<p>With jaw of the ass I smote an ox-load of men.”</span><p>The versions are, of course, unable to preserve these rough paronomasias, which are characteristic of the age. It would be quite a mistake to infer that they show any levity of spirit in Samson. On the contrary, such peculiarities of expression often arise out of deep emotion. When John of Gaunt begins his dying speech to Richard II. with—<p>“Old Gaunt, indeed! and gaunt in being old,” &c.,<p>the king asks:—<p>“Can sick men play so nicely with their names?”<p>and the dying prince makes the striking answer:—<p>“No; misery makes sport to mock herself.”<p>I have fully examined the whole subject in <span class= "ital">Chapters on Language, </span>pp. 227-238. These sallies of playful fancy tended no less than the flashes of military prowess to prepare the nation for better times by keeping up their buoyant mood. “The nation felt unsubdued in mind and body, while its sons could flow out in such health and vivacity;” and thus Samson <span class= "ital">began </span>to deliver them, though his actual deeds were casual—“a sort of teasing, reiterated mark of mortifying humiliation” (Ewald).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-16.htm" title="And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps on heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.">Jdg 15:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Heaps upon heaps, </span>&c. — Hebrew, <span class="ital">a heap, two heaps. </span>As much as to say, I have not only slain enow to make one heap, but two or more. <span class="ital">I have slain a thousand men — </span>What could be too hard for him to do, on whom <span class="ital">the Spirit of the Lord came mightily? </span>This seems like a short hymn or song of triumph, which Samson uttered after he had routed the Philistines. It is strange that the men of Judah did not now, at least, come to his assistance. But he was to be a type of him who <span class="ital">trod the wine-press alone.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Sin dispirits men, it hides from their eyes the things that belong to their peace. The Israelites blamed Samson for what he had done against the Philistines, as if he had done them a great injury. Thus our Lord Jesus did many good works, and for those the Jews were ready to stone him. When the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, his cords were loosed: where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and those are free indeed who are thus set free. Thus Christ triumphed over the powers of darkness that shouted against him, as if they had him in their power. Samson made great destruction among the Philistines. To take the bone of an ass for this, was to do wonders by the foolish things of the world, that the excellency of the power might be of God, not of man. This victory was not in the weapon, was not in the arm; but it was in the Spirit of God, which moved the weapon by the arm. We can do all things through Him that strengtheneth us. Seest thou a poor Christian, who is enabled to overcome a temptation by weak, feeble counsel, there is the Philistine vanquished by a sorry jaw-bone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is a play upon the word, three times repeated, which means both "an ass" and also "a heap."

With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men&#8212;The inadequacy of the weapon plainly shows this to have been a miraculous feat, "a case of supernatural strength," just as the gift of prophecy is a case of supernatural knowledge [Chalmers].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This, though it might seem difficult, yet is not at all impossible or incredible; especially seeing the learned affirm of the asses of Syria, that they were larger and stronger than ours, and so consequently were their bones. And withal, it must be acknowledged that there was something extraordinary and miraculous in this, as there was unquestionably in Samson’s strength, and so all the difficulty vanisheth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Samson said,.... In a kind of triumphant song: <p>with the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps; that is, with such an instrument he had slain heaps of men, who lay dead in heaps upon one another; in the words for an "ass", and for an "heap", is an elegant "paronomosia", not easy to be expressed in our language: <p>with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men: this he said not in a proud and haughty manner, ascribing it to himself, as Josephus suggests (m), since he takes notice of the mean instrument he used; which showed that he was sensible it was not done by his own power, but by the power of God, which enabled him by such weak means to do such wonderful things. <p>(m) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 8. sect. 9. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">heaps upon heaps</span>] See marg., and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-14.htm" title="And they gathered them together on heaps: and the land stank.">Exodus 8:14</a> [Hebrews 10, lit. <span class="ital">heaps, heaps</span>].

Instead of recognising in Samson a deliverer whom the Lord had raised up for them, and crowding round him that they might smite their oppressors with his help and drive them out of the land, the men of Judah were so degraded, that they cast this reproach at Samson: "Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? Wherefore hast thou done this (the deed described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8</a>)? We have come down to bind thee, and deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines." Samson replied, "Swear to me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves." &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506; with &#1489;&#1468;, to thrust at a person, fall upon him, including in this case, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-13.htm">Judges 15:13</a>, the intention of killing.</body></html>
