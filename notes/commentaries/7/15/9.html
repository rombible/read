It was called in full Ramath-Lehi. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.">Judges 15:17</a>.) The character of the narrative suggests the question whether the name may not have existed previously, and the play on words may not have been <span class= "ital">adapted </span>by Samson to the incident. For the name of the place is <span class= "ital">Lechi </span>(<span class= "greekheb">לֶ֫חִי </span>), and “a jawbone” is <span class= "ital">Lehi </span>(<span class= "greekheb">להי</span>)<span class= "ital">. Shen, </span>“tooth,” is the name of an isolated sharp rock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.">1Samuel 14:4</a>), and therefore “jaw” would not be an unnatural name for a range of such rocks. Josephus, however, says that before Samson’s exploit the place “had no name.” It may be again alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm" title="And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.">2Samuel 23:11</a>, where the words rendered “into a troop” may mean “to Lehi,” as it is understood by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. </span>vii. 12, § 4) and some MSS. of the LXX.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:9-17 Sin dispirits men, it hides from their eyes the things that belong to their peace. The Israelites blamed Samson for what he had done against the Philistines, as if he had done them a great injury. Thus our Lord Jesus did many good works, and for those the Jews were ready to stone him. When the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, his cords were loosed: where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and those are free indeed who are thus set free. Thus Christ triumphed over the powers of darkness that shouted against him, as if they had him in their power. Samson made great destruction among the Philistines. To take the bone of an ass for this, was to do wonders by the foolish things of the world, that the excellency of the power might be of God, not of man. This victory was not in the weapon, was not in the arm; but it was in the Spirit of God, which moved the weapon by the arm. We can do all things through Him that strengtheneth us. Seest thou a poor Christian, who is enabled to overcome a temptation by weak, feeble counsel, there is the Philistine vanquished by a sorry jaw-bone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Spread themselves - An expression used of the Philistine mode of war <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-22.htm">2 Samuel 5:22</a>, alluding to the compact way in which they came up the wadys, and then distpersed.

Then the Philistines went up&#8212;to the high land of Judah.<p>and spread themselves in Lehi&#8212;now El-Lekieh, abounding with limestone cliffs; the sides of which are perforated with caves. The object of the Philistines in this expedition was to apprehend Samson, in revenge for the great slaughter he had committed on their people. With a view of freeing his own countrymen from all danger from the infuriated Philistines, he allowed himself to be bound and surrendered a fettered prisoner into their power. Exulting with joy at the near prospect of riddance from so formidable an enemy, they went to meet him. But he exerted his superhuman strength, and finding a new (or moist) jawbone of an ass, he laid hold of it, and with no other weapon, slew a thousand men at a place which he called Ramath-lehi&#8212;that is, "the hill of the jawbone."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The rock Etam was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in Judah:</span> see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-32.htm" title="And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan, five cities:">1 Chronicles 4:32</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm" title="And Rehoboam dwelled in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.">2 Chronicles 11:5</a>,6</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Spread themselves, </span> as coming in great numbers with a powerful host. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lehi; </span> a place so called by anticipation, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.">Judges 15:17</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the Philistines went up,....

The situation of Lehi is unknown; it must have been nearer to the Philistines than Etam, and in the neighbourhood of the other places already mentioned.

Ass’s Jaw (<span class="greekheb">Ὄνου γνάθος</span>), the name of a peninsula W. of Cape Malea in the Peloponnese (Strabo, p. 363), and the Arabic place-name Camel’s Jaw (<span class="ital">laḥy gamal</span>, quot. by Wellhausen).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10f.</span> The Philistines have no quarrel with any one but Samson, and the Judaeans exhibit no resentment against their alien rulers. This shews that Samson’s attacks upon the Philistines were of a purely local and private nature, and that the Israelites in this part of the country had not yet acquired any sense of national feeling or of a common cause.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>9–20. <span class="ital">Local traditions<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span>Provoked by Samson’s violence, the Philistines made a raid upon Lehi in Judah for the purpose of capturing their enemy. The name of the place was suggestive, and tradition attached to it the story of S.’s feat with the ‘fresh jawbone (<span class="ital">lěḥî</span>) of an ass.’ Popular etymology explained Ramath-lehi, ‘the height of Lehi’ (from <span class="ital">rûm</span>), as the place where S. ‘threw away’ (<span class="ital">râmâh</span>) the jawbone; a hollow basin in the hill side, which held the water of the ‘Partridge Spring’ (‘<span class="ital">ên haḳḳôrç</span>’), became the spring which God granted when S. ‘called’ (<span class="ital">ḳârâ’</span>) for help in his exhaustion. It is noteworthy that the exploit of Shammah, one of David’s heroes, also took place at Lehi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm" title="And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite.

Samson regarded the treatment which he had received from his father-in-law as but one effect of the disposition of the Philistines generally towards the Israelites, and therefore resolved to avenge the wrong which he had received from one member of the Philistines upon the whole nation, or at all events upon the whole of the city of Timnath. </body></html>
