Lehi is here the name of the place, and if the fountain is said to have sprung up in <span class= "ital">Hammaktesh, “the </span>tooth-socket” (Vulg., <span class= "ital">molarem</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>that is only due to the play on words which characterises the narrative. When the cliff had got the name of “Jawbone,” the spring would naturally be called a <span class= "ital">“</span>tooth-socket.” The word <span class= "ital">maktesh </span>properly means “a mortar” (Greek, <span class= "ital">holmiskos; </span>Lat., <span class= "ital">mortariolum</span>) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-22.htm" title="Though you should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.">Proverbs 27:22</a>), and this name was transferred to the sockets of teeth.

I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys . . . I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water”). Josephus says that God caused to spring up for Samson “a plentiful fountain of sweet water at a certain rock.”<p><span class= "bld">He called the name thereof.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the name thereof was called.</span><p><span class= "bld">En-hakkore.</span>—<span class= "ital">The Spring of the Crier. </span>These names have vanished, but perhaps traces of them may still be discovered “in the abundant springs and numerous eminences of the district round Urtas,” the place from which Solomon’s pleasure-gardens and the Temple and Bethlehem were supplied with water.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-19.htm" title="But God split an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of there; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: why he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.">Jdg 15:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">God clave a hollow place in the jaw — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">a cavity that was in Lehi, </span>as he had just named the place, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.">Jdg 15:17</a>, and as the same word is rendered in the latter part of this verse. “It is very evident,” says Dr. Dodd, “from what follows, that our translation” (namely, in the former part of the verse) “is erroneous; since, if God had caused water to come from the <span class="ital">jaw, </span>only for the present satisfying of Samson’s necessities, it is reasonable to suppose that Samson would have given it the name <span class="ital">of a well, </span>or <span class="ital">fountain, </span>or that the sacred historian would have told us that it <span class="ital">remained in Lehi unto this day. </span>The rendering, therefore, of the margin, which is followed by Dr. Waterland, is far the best. Houbigant observes, very properly, that the word rendered <span class="ital">hollow place </span>(<span class="greekheb">מכתשׁ</span>, <span class="ital">miktesh,</span>) signifies <span class="ital">a rock; </span>and he renders the verse thus: ‘Then God clave the rock which was in Lehi, and there came water from thence; which when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived; therefore Samson called the fountain, <span class="ital">the fountain of the implorer, </span>which fountain is in Lehi unto this day.’ Modern travellers inform us, that in the suburbs of Eleutheropolis, (in all probability the ancient Lehi,) the fountain which flowed upon this occasion is still remaining, and called to this day <span class="ital">the fountain of the jaw; </span>an observation which abundantly confirms the interpretation we have given.” <span class="ital">He called the name thereof En-hakkore; </span>that is, <span class="ital">the fountain of him that cried </span>for thirst; or, that called on God for deliverance; or, the fountain that was given in answer to prayer. <span class="ital">Which is in Lehi — </span>So that our translators take Lehi here to be the name of a place.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:18-20 So little notice did the men of Judah take of their deliverer, that he was ready to perish for want of a draught of water. Thus are the greatest slights often put upon those who do the greatest services. Samson prayed to God in this distress. Those that forget to attend God their praises, may be compelled to attend him with their prayers. Past experiences of God's power and goodness, are excellent pleas in prayer for further mercy. He pleads his being exposed to God's enemies; our best pleas are taken from God's glory. The Lord sent him seasonable relief. The place of this action was, from the jaw-bone, called Lehi. And in the place thus called, God caused a fountain suddenly and seasonably to open, close by Samson. We should be more thankful for the mercy of water, did we consider how ill we can spare it. Israel submitted to him whom they had betrayed. God was with him; henceforward they were directed by him as their judge.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An hollow place that was in the jaw - The right translation is, "the hollow place which is in Lehi." The word translated "hollow place," means a "mortar" <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>, and is here evidently a hollow or basin among the cliffs of Lehi, which, from its shape, was called "the mortar."

A socket in which was fastened one of the teeth, and was in the form of a mortar; so Jarchi and Ben Melech, as the word for an hollow place signifies; one of the grinders was knocked out, and so the place where it had been was left hollow, and out of that sprung a stream or flow of water; which was very wonderful, since out of such a place rather blood, or purulent matter, would naturally have issued; the Targum is,"the Lord clave the rock which was in the jaw;''which Kimchi interprets thus, the rock was under the jaw and the rock was made as a hollow place, and therefore they call it "mactes", a mortar: the sense seems to be this, that the place on which Samson cast the jawbone was a rock, and there God clave an hollow place, out of which water sprung, and which perhaps was under the jawbone, and sprung under it, and through it; and so Josephus says (o), that God at his prayer brought a sweet and large fountain out of a certain rock; and the words of the text will bear to be rendered, "and God clave, an hollow place, which is in Lehi"; that is, in the place called Lehi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-9.htm">Judges 15:9</a> and not in the jawbone itself: <p>and when he had drank, his spirit came again, and he revived; his spirit was sunk and gone, as it were, but upon drinking a draught of this water he was refreshed and cheered, recovered his spirits, and became brisk and lively: <p>wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore; that is,"the fountain of him that was calling;''of Samson that called upon God in prayer, and was heard, in memory of which he gave it this name; so the Targum,"therefore its name was called the fountain that was given through the prayer of Samson:" <p>which is in Lehi unto this day; or in the jawbone: not that the jawbone continued unto the time of the writer of this book, but the name of the place where this miracle was wrought, which was in Lehi, continued to be called Enhakkore unto that time, and it may be the fountain itself continued also; nay, Giycas (p) says, who lived but about six hundred years ago, that the fountain continued unto his time, and was to be seen in the suburbs of Eleutheropolis, and was called the fountain of the jawbone. <p>(o) Ibid.

Some of the Greek versions render the word by <span class="greekheb">ὅλμος</span>, which can mean both a mortar and the hollow of a double tooth; Symmachus likewise translates <span class="ital">the grinder</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὴν μύλην</span>); and thus arose another way of understanding the word, viz. <span class="ital">the molar tooth</span>, so Vulgate The LXX transl. as RV. ‘the hole which is in Siagon.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his spirit … revived</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-27.htm" title="And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:">Genesis 45:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The spring, which was pointed out in the writer’s day, and therefore could not have had anything to do with a jawbone, was known as En-hakkore, i.e. the Spring of the Partridge (lit. <span class="ital">the crier</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-20.htm" title="Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.">1 Samuel 26:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-11.htm" title="As the partridge sits on eggs, and hatches them not; so he that gets riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the middle of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.">Jeremiah 17:11</a>); playing on the word, the story-tellers connected it with Samson’s <span class="ital">cry</span> to God in his thirst.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (or, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God clave</span>, etc. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-8.htm">Numbers 20:8, 11</a>. The A.V. (as the Septuagint and Vulgate seem to have done, and Luther and others) has quite misconceived the statement in the text, as if God had cloven a hollow place in the jawbone, and brought out the water thence; whereas the statement is quite clear that <span class="accented">God clave the hollow place which is in Lehi</span> (<span class="accented">hal-Lehi</span>, ver. 9, note), and that a spring of water came out, to which Samson gave the name <span class="accented">En-hakkorch</span>, the spring of him that called upon God, which name continued till the time of the writer. The spring apparently continued till the time of St. Jerome, and of other later writers, in the seventh, twelfth, and fourteenth centuries; but Robinson was unable to identify it with any certainty ('B.R.,' 2:64). The word translated the (not a) <span class="accented">hollow place</span> (ham-<span class="accented">maktesh</span>) means a <span class="accented">mortar</span>; also the <span class="accented">cavity in the jaw</span> from which the molar teeth grow.
