Such plays on words in serious narratives point to a very early form of literature—but probably they then rose from some popular proverb.

Again, the capture and naming of these towns is dated in different periods, in the time of Moses according to Num. l.c., and in the time of the Judges here. But the inconsistency lies only on the surface. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/32-39.htm" title="And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it....">Numbers 32:39-42</a> is an ancient fragment incorporated into a later account (JE and P) of the conquest of E. Jordan, apparently for the purpose of bringing Manasseh’s occupation of this district within the Mosaic period; the fragment closely resembles the brief traditions preserved in Judges 1 and may be taken to refer to the same period, viz. that of the Judges, to which the present verse assigns the episode. Later on the Havvoth-jair seem to have passed into the hands of another race, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-23.htm" title="And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even three score cities. All these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead.">1 Chronicles 2:23</a> (RV.), which probably reflects the conditions of a subsequent age. The difference in the numbers of the villages, thirty, thirty-two (LXX here), twenty-three (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm" title="And Segub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the land of Gilead.">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>), is not important.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty ass colts</span>.
