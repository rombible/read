This earlier Jair, with Nobah, plays a splendid part in Jewish legend, which is only alluded to in Scripture (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>). In what relation the Jair of these verses stood to him we cannot, in the uncertain data of the chronology, decide. The Jair of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm" title="And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.">Numbers 32:41</a> was descended from Judah on the father’s side, and on the mother’s was a great-grandson of Manasseh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/10-3.htm" title="And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years....">Jdg 10:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jair, a Gileadite — </span>Of Gilead, beyond Jordan. <span class="ital">He had thirty sons — </span>Who, it seems, were itinerant judges, and went from place to place, as their father’s deputies, to administer justice. <span class="ital">That rode on thirty ass- colts — </span>It was customary for the noblest persons to ride on those beasts, and that not only in Judea, but likewise in Arabia, and other countries, even among the Romans. <span class="ital">Thirty cities, called Havoth-jair — </span>That is, the villages of Jair.

We read of Jair the son of Segub, the son of Machir's daughter by Hezron, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21-23</a>, and are there told that he had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead (called Havoth-jair), which were included in the territory of the sons of Machir. The same information is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40-42</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14, 15</a>, in both which passages Jair is styled the son of Manasseh, and is stated to have called the cities after his own name, Havoth-jair. In the present verse we are also told that Jair the judge was a Gileadite, and that he had thirty sons who had thirty cities in Gilead called Havoth-jair. The question arises, Can these two be the same person? If they are, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> must be a later parenthetical insertion, as it has very much the appearance of being. The notice in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a> must also refer to later times than those of Moses, and we must understand the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>, that "Segub begat Jair," as meaning that he was his lineal ancestor, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8</a> we read that "Joram begat Ozias," though three generations intervened between them. If, on the other hand, they are not the same, we must suppose that Jair in our text was a descendant of the other Jair, and may compare the double explanation of the name Havoth-jair with the double explanation of <span class="accented">Beer-sheba</span> given <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-31.htm">Genesis 26:31-33</a>; the threefold explanation of the name Isaac, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6</a>; and the double explanation of the proverb, "Is Saul among the prophets?" given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23, 24</a>.

Thebez, according to the Onom. thirteen miles from Neapolis (Shechem) on the road to Scythopolis (Beisan), has been preserved in the large village of Tubs on the north of Shechem (see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 156, and Bibl. Res. p. 305). This town possessed a strong tower, in which men and women and all the inhabitants of the town took refuge and shut themselves in. But when Abimelech advanced to the tower and drew near to the door to set it on fire, a woman threw a millstone down upon him from the roof of the tower and smashed his skull, whereupon he called hastily to the attendant who carried his weapons to give him his death-blow with his sword, that men might not say of him "a woman slew him." &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;, the upper millstone which was turned round, lapis vector (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;: from &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, with a toneless i, possibly to distinguish it from &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509; (from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;). &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, an unusual form for &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;, which is found in the edition of Norzi (Mantua, 1742).</body></html>
