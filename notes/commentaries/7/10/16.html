And it is probable that, for the present, a thorough reformation took place, and that they entirely quitted the worship of strange gods, and served the Lord alone. <span class="ital">His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel — </span>That is, upon their repentance and reformation he turned away his anger, had compassion upon them on account of their miseries, and acted toward them like one that felt their sufferings. He changed his carriage toward them, and punished their enemies as sorely as if they had grieved and injured his own person. From this chapter we may learn the amazing depravity of human nature, and how readily it falls from one degree of degeneracy to another. God, who knows what our nature is, foresaw that apostacy to idolatry would be the certain consequence of the Israelites dwelling among the heathen nations, and therefore had strictly commanded them to expel those nations entirely out of Canaan, and to have no communication with them. But the Israelites did not obey his commands in this; and, in neglecting this one thing, fell into all the errors, crimes, and miseries, which God had forewarned them would be the consequence. They thought there was but little harm in letting the Canaanites remain among them as long as they lived peaceably with them. But, alas! <span class="ital">evil communication </span>unavoidably <span class="ital">corrupts good manners; </span>they could not converse and traffic with the Canaanites without, by degrees, contracting a friendship with them, perhaps thinking they should be strengthened by these alliances with the inhabitants of the land. This naturally produced at least a complaisant deference to their customs and religious ceremonies, and, in a little longer time, the adjoining some of those customs and ceremonies with their own; till at last they fell into all the abominations of the nations; to deliver them from which, the true God had done so many wondrous works. From hence we may learn how we may, by offending in a single point only, and that not seeming in itself absolutely immoral, or of any great consequence, be by degrees carried entirely out of the paths of piety, and brought to the greatest degeneracy. We may further observe, from the circumstances of the Israelites, related in this chapter, that afflictions are of great use, and are employed by God to bring men to a right sense of their duty, and into the paths of righteousness, from which they had wandered by their follies. And we may also learn, that God is always ready to receive us with forgiveness and mercy whenever we return to him. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/judges/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 God is able to multiply men's punishments according to the numbers of their sins and idols. But there is hope when sinners cry to the Lord for help, and lament their ungodliness as well as their more open transgressions. It is necessary, in true repentance, that there be a full conviction that those things cannot help us which we have set in competition with God. They acknowledged what they deserved, yet prayed to God not to deal with them according to their deserts. We must submit to God's justice, with a hope in his mercy. True repentance is not only for sin, but from sin. As the disobedience and misery of a child are a grief to a tender father, so the provocations of God's people are a grief to him. From him mercy never can be sought in vain. Let then the trembling sinner, and the almost despairing backslider, cease from debating about God's secret purposes, or from expecting to find hope from former experiences. Let them cast themselves on the mercy of God our Saviour, humble themselves under his hand, seek deliverance from the powers of darkness, separate themselves from sin, and from occasions of it, use the means of grace diligently, and wait the Lord's time, and so they shall certainly rejoice in his mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Zidonians - An allusion to the time of Barak, when the Zidonians doubtless formed part of the great confederacy of Canaanites under Jabin king of Hazor.

Baalim is a general term used to denote all the false gods, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>. This answer on the part of God to the prayer of the Israelites for help is not to be regarded as having been given through an extraordinary manifestation (theophany), or through the medium of a prophet, for that would certainly have been recorded; but it was evidently given in front of the tabernacle, where the people had called upon the Lord, and either came through the high priest, or else through an inward voice in which God spoke to the hearts of the people, i.e., through the voice of their own consciences, by which God recalled to their memories and impressed upon their hearts first of all His own gracious acts, and then their faithless apostasy. There is an anakolouthon in the words of God. The construction which is commenced with &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is dropped at &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-12.htm">Judges 10:12</a>; and the verb &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, which answers to the beginning of the clause, is brought up afterwards in the form of an apodosis with &#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;. "Did I not deliver you (1) from the Egyptians (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1-14</a>); (2) from the Amorites (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>); (3) from the Ammonites (who oppressed Israel along with the Moabites in the time of Ehud, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>.); (4) from the Philistines (through Shamgar: see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-9.htm">1 Samuel 12:9</a>, where the Philistines are mentioned between Sisera and Moab); (5) from the Sidonians (among whom probably the northern Canaanites under Jabin are included, as Sidon, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>, appears to have exercised a kind of principality or protectorate over the northern tribes of Canaan); (6) from the Amalekites (who attacked the Israelites even at Horeb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>., and afterwards invaded the land of Israel both with the Moabites, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>, and also with the Midianites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>); and (7) from the Midianites?" (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6.htm">Judges 6-7</a>). The last is the reading of the lxx in Cod. Al. and Vat., viz., &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;; whereas Ald. and Compl. read &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;, also the Vulgate. In the Masoretic text, on the other hand, we have Maon. Were this the original and true reading, we might perhaps think of the Mehunim, who are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a> along with Philistines and Arabians (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41</a>), and are supposed to have been inhabitants of the city of Maan on the Syrian pilgrim road to the east of Petra (Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 734 and 1035: see Ewald, Gesch. i. pp. 321, 322). But there is very little probability in this supposition, as we cannot possibly see how so small a people could have oppressed Israel so grievously at that time, that the deliverance from their oppression could be mentioned here; whilst it would be very strange that nothing should be said about the terrible oppression of the Midianites and the wonderful deliverance from that oppression effected by Gideon. Consequently the Septuagint (&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;) appears to have preserve the original text.</body></html>
