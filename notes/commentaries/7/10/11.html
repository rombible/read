But there is hope when sinners cry to the Lord for help, and lament their ungodliness as well as their more open transgressions. It is necessary, in true repentance, that there be a full conviction that those things cannot help us which we have set in competition with God. They acknowledged what they deserved, yet prayed to God not to deal with them according to their deserts. We must submit to God's justice, with a hope in his mercy. True repentance is not only for sin, but from sin. As the disobedience and misery of a child are a grief to a tender father, so the provocations of God's people are a grief to him. From him mercy never can be sought in vain. Let then the trembling sinner, and the almost despairing backslider, cease from debating about God's secret purposes, or from expecting to find hope from former experiences. Let them cast themselves on the mercy of God our Saviour, humble themselves under his hand, seek deliverance from the powers of darkness, separate themselves from sin, and from occasions of it, use the means of grace diligently, and wait the Lord's time, and so they shall certainly rejoice in his mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/judges/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>(See the marginal references).

Nothing further is related of him than that he had thirty sons who rode upon thirty asses, which was a sign of distinguished rank in those times when the Israelites had no horses. They had thirty cities (the second &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a> is another form for &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, from a singular &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;  equals  &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, a city, and is chosen because of its similarity in sound to &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, asses). These cities they were accustomed to call Havvoth-jair unto this day (the time when our book was written), in the land of Gilead. The &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; before &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is placed first for the sake of emphasis, "even these they call," etc. This statement is not at variance with the fact, that in the time of Moses the Manassite Jair gave the name of Havvoth-jair to the towns of Bashan which had been conquered by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>); for it is not affirmed here, that the thirty cities which belonged to the sons of Jair received this name for the first time from the judge Jair, but simply that this name was brought into use again by the sons of Jair, and was applied to these cities in a peculiar sense. (For further remarks on the Havvoth-jair, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>.) The situation of Camon, where Jair was buried, is altogether uncertain. Josephus (Ant. v. 6, 6) calls it a city of Gilead, though probably only on account of the assumption, that it would not be likely that Jair the Gileadite, who possessed so many cities in Gilead, should be buried outside Gilead. But this assumption is a very questionable one. As Jair judged Israel after Tola the Issacharite, the assumption is a more natural one, that he lived in Canaan proper. Yet Reland (Pal. ill. p. 679) supports the opinion that it was in Gilead, and adduces the fact that Polybius (Hist. v. 70, 12) mentions a town called &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, by the side of Pella and Gefrun, as having been taken by Antiochus. On the other hand, Eusebius and Jerome (in the Onom.) regard our Camon as being the same as the &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x39b;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;, six Roman miles to the north of Legio (Lejun), on the way to Ptolemais, which would be in the plain of Jezreel or Esdraelon. This is no doubt applicable to the &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; of Judith 7:3; but whether it also applies to our Camon cannot be decided, as the town is not mentioned again. </body></html>
