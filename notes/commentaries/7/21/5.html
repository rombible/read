The spirit of this <span class= "ital">cherem </span>was exactly the same as that which we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-23.htm" title="Curse you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.">Judges 5:23</a> : “Curse ye Meroz . . . because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.” Now that these victories had been so complete, they probably were sick with slaughter, and would not have inquired after any defaulters but by way of finding an expedient to mollify the meaning of their rash oath. We see once more in this narrative both the force derivable from a vow and the folly and wickedness of fierce vows rashly taken in moments of passion. It is obvious that the direct <span class= "ital">meaning </span>of the vow, taken in connection with the curse under which they had placed the Benjamites, had been to annihilate the tribe.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/judges/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm" title="And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD?

Some, however, think that the altar here mentioned was "additional" to the brass altar, in consequence of the unusual number of sacrifices caused by the presence of the whole congregation (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-64.htm">1 Kings 8:64</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-5. the people came to the house of God, &#8230; and lifted up their voices, and wept sore&#8212;The characteristic fickleness of the Israelites was not long in being displayed; for scarcely had they cooled from the fierceness of their sanguinary vengeance, than they began to relent and rushed to the opposite extreme of self-accusation and grief at the desolation which their impetuous zeal had produced. Their victory saddened and humbled them. Their feelings on the occasion were expressed by a public and solemn service of expiation at the house of God. And yet this extraordinary observance, though it enabled them to find vent for their painful emotions, did not afford them full relief, for they were fettered by the obligation of a religious vow, heightened by the addition of a solemn anathema on every violator of the oath. There is no previous record of this oath; but the purport of it was, that they would treat the perpetrators of this Gibeah atrocity in the same way as the Canaanites, who were doomed to destruction; and the entering into this solemn league was of a piece with the rest of their inconsiderate conduct in this whole affair.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A great oath.</span> i.e. a solemn oath, joined with some terrible execration against the offenders herein. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He shall surely be put to death; </span> because by refusing to execute the vengeance due to such malefactors, they were justly presumed guilty of the crime, and therefore liable to the same punishment, as was the case of that city that would not deliver up an idolater dwelling among them to justice. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Israel said,....
