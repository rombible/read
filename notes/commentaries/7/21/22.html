It was done on festive occasions, as it is still in the East, not in town, but in the open air, in some adjoining field, the women being by themselves. The young women being alone indulging their light and buoyant spirits, and apprehensive of no danger, facilitated the execution of the scheme of seizing them, which closely resembles the Sabine rape in Roman history. The elders undertook to reconcile the families to the forced abduction of their daughters. And thus the expression of their public sanction to this deed of violence afforded a new evidence of the evils and difficulties into which the unhappy precipitancy of the Israelites in this crisis had involved them.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be favourable unto them; </span> pass by their offence, if not for their sakes, whom necessity forced to this course; yet for our sakes, and indeed for your own sakes; for both you and we have done them a great injury in prosecuting them with so much fury, as to endanger the utter extinction of the whole tribe; and therefore this is the least we can do by way of reparation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the war; </span> either, first, In the war with Jabesh-gilead, wherein they should have taken care to reserve a sufficient number, which they might have done, by sparing either so many of the married women as were necessary, who, their former husbands being slain, might have been married to those Benjamites; or as many of the younger virgins, who, within a little time, might have been married to them, whom many suppose that they slew. Or, secondly, In the war with the Benjamites, in which they acknowledge their cruelty in destroying the women with such fury, as not to leave a competent number for the men which were left. See <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm" title="And the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.">Judges 20:48</a></span>. Ye <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> Whether this did really discharge them from their oath? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> First, It seems to excuse those parents of these virgins who were not acquainted with the plot, and did neither directly nor indirectly give their daughters to them, but they were taken away by force, without their knowledge and consent. If it be said those parents might and should have retaken their daughters from them; it may be replied, that they could not do so before they were corrupted, and the rulers of Israel would not assist them with their power to recover them. And it is a maxim, That many things which ought not to be done, when once they are done, should not be undone. And for those parents who were conscious of the design, it is probable they kept their daughters at home to avoid this. Secondly, Either the oath was made with an exception of the case of the total extirpation of a tribe, or it was a rash oath to do what was out of their power, or what they could not lawfully do, to wit, utterly to destroy a tribe out of Israel, which therefore they here speak of with horror, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-3.htm" title="And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?">Judges 21:3</a>,6</span>; and if so, as they sinned in making it, so they were not obliged to keep it; it being an acknowledged truth, that rash and sinful oaths are better broken than kept. Thirdly. Yet they cannot be wholly excused from sin in this matter; for as it was folly to take such an oath as it is expressed, so the manner of freeing themselves from their own snare is fraudulent and injurious to the parents, in disposing of their children without their consent. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain,.... Of this rape of their daughters or sisters, or to bring an action against them, and desire they might be summoned before them, the elders of the people, and be tried and judged according to law for what they had done; or to put them upon going to war with them again for such treatment of them: <p>that we will say unto them, be favourable unto them for our sakes; for the sake of the elders, who advised them to do what they did; or for the sake of us Israelites, your sake and ours, who were too severe upon them, and prosecuted the war with too much vigour, which made what they have done necessary, or otherwise a tribe must have been lost in Israel: <p>because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war; either in the war with Benjamin, which they carried on with such wrath and fury as to destroy all the women, so that there were no wives left for the men that remained, which they now repented of; or in the war with Jabeshgilead, they did not reserve enough of the women taken, only four hundred virgins, whereas there were six hundred men: but the first seems best: <p>for ye did not give unto them at this time, that you should be guilty; the meaning is, that if they had any uneasiness upon their minds about the oath which they had taken, not to give any of their daughters in marriage to Benjamin, they need not be disturbed at that, since they did not "give" them to them, but these "took" them by force; which was the scheme these elders contrived to secure from the violation of the oath. This they proposed to say to quiet them, and make them easy, to which other things might have been added as that these were their brethren, and not strangers they were married to, and not to mean men, but to men of large estates, having the whole inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin devolved upon them; and their daughters would be the original mothers of the posterity of that tribe in succeeding ages. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/judges/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it shall be, <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, <i>that</i> ye should be guilty.</span><p>(i) Though they attempted to convince man that they had kept their oath, before God it was broken.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. The verse is difficult to understand owing to corruptions in the text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to complain unto us</span>] Follow marg., and read <span class="ital">to</span> <span class="bld">strive</span> <span class="ital">with</span> <span class="bld">you</span> (so LXX, Vulgate); the angry parents would naturally go to the captors with their grievance, rather than to the Israelites.

The correction <span class="ital">they</span> (for <span class="ital">we</span>) <span class="ital">received not</span> is supported by some mss. of the LXX The war will be that against Jabesh-gilead; but since the verse as a whole seems to belong to the older narrative, which knows nothing of the expedition against Jabesh, the sentence <span class="ital">because they received not each his wife in the war</span> must be regarded as a harmonizing attempt to work in the narrative of B with that of A (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-14.htm" title="And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.">Jdg 21:14</a></span> b, 16a).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some scholars emend the text differently, reading <span class="ital">Be gracious to them because they took each his wife in the war</span>; the omission of the negative is found in some mss. of the LXX, but the evidence is not weighty enough for treating this as the true text of the LXX; moreover <span class="ital">the war</span> is too strong a term to apply to the rape of the Shilonites.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be favourable unto them for our sakes</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">Grant us them as a favour</span>, the masculine <span class="accented">them</span> referring to <span class="accented">the daughters of Shiloh</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in ver. 12, and the verb <span class="accented">grant a favour</span> being followed by a double accusative. <span class="cmt_word">We reserved not to each man his wife</span>, etc. These words are somewhat difficult. If we may insert the word to, as the A.V. does, before <span class="accented">each</span> <span class="accented">man</span> (for it is wanting in the Hebrew), the sense is good. The Israelites acknowledge their own fault in not reserving women enough to be wives to the Benjamites, and ask the fathers and brothers of the daughters of Shiloh to do them a favour by enabling them to repair their fault. But it is rather a strain upon the words. The omission of the <span class="accented">to</span> is not natural in such a phrase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-54.htm">Numbers 26:54</a> is hardly to the point, nor is <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>, where the <span class="accented">to</span> had been expressed before the us), and <span class="accented">reserved</span> is a forced interpretation of the verb. If the words were spoken by the Benjamites, all would be plain and easy: "We received not each man his wife in the war." Hence some put the speech into the mouth of Benjamin, as though the Israelites meant, We will say in your names, in your persons, as your attorneys, so to speak, "Grant them to us," etc. But this is rather forced. Others, therefore, follow the Peschito, and read, "<span class="accented">because</span> THEY received not each man his wife," etc., which makes very good sense, but has not MS. authority. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did not give</span>, etc., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you need not fear the guilt of the broken oath, because you did not <span class="accented">give</span> your daughters, so as to violate the oath (ver. 7), but they were taken from you by force. The A.V. gives the probable meaning of the passage, though it is somewhat obscure. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of the six hundred Benjaminites who had escaped, there still remained two hundred to be provided with wives. To these the congregation gave permission to take wives by force at a festival at Shiloh. The account of this is once more introduced, with a description of the anxiety felt by the congregation for the continuance of the tribe of Benjamin. <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-15.htm">Judges 21:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-16.htm">Judges 21:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-18.htm">Judges 21:18</a> are only a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-7.htm">Judges 21:7</a>, with a slight change of expression. The "breach (perez) in the tribes of Israel" had arisen from the almost complete extermination of Benjamin. "For out of Benjamin is (every) woman destroyed," viz., by the ruthless slaughter of the whole of the people of that tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a>). Consequently the Benjaminites who were still unmarried could not find any wives in their own tribe. The fact that four hundred of the Benjaminites who remained were already provided with wives is not noticed here, because it has been stated just before, and of course none of them could give up their own wives to others. </body></html>
