In these unsettled times men went up to Shiloh (Seilun) only once a year <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a> instead of thrice; only the males kept the Feasts, and therefore the virgins of Shiloh would naturally be the only maidens present, and the public festival would be a likely occasion for their festive dances. It is, however, possible that some particular feast unique to Shiloh is meant, like the yearly sacrifice of David's family in Bethlehem <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem&#8212;The exact site of the place was described evidently for the direction of the Benjamites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin,....
