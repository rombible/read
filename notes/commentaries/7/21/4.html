Unless the entire tabernacle had, for the time, been removed to Bethel, there was no regular altar there. It has been suggested that in any case this altar must have been necessitated by the multitude of sacrifices required for the holocausts and the food of the people. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">Judges 20:26</a>.)

Thus Solomon did when he dedicated the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-64.htm" title="The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.">1 Kings 8:64</a>.

Some, however, think that the altar here mentioned was "additional" to the brass altar, in consequence of the unusual number of sacrifices caused by the presence of the whole congregation (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-64.htm">1 Kings 8:64</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-5. the people came to the house of God, &#8230; and lifted up their voices, and wept sore&#8212;The characteristic fickleness of the Israelites was not long in being displayed; for scarcely had they cooled from the fierceness of their sanguinary vengeance, than they began to relent and rushed to the opposite extreme of self-accusation and grief at the desolation which their impetuous zeal had produced. Their victory saddened and humbled them. Their feelings on the occasion were expressed by a public and solemn service of expiation at the house of God. And yet this extraordinary observance, though it enabled them to find vent for their painful emotions, did not afford them full relief, for they were fettered by the obligation of a religious vow, heightened by the addition of a solemn anathema on every violator of the oath. There is no previous record of this oath; but the purport of it was, that they would treat the perpetrators of this Gibeah atrocity in the same way as the Canaanites, who were doomed to destruction; and the entering into this solemn league was of a piece with the rest of their inconsiderate conduct in this whole affair.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Built there an altar; </span> not for a monument of the victory, as some say, but for sacrifices, as the next words show. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> What need was there of this, when the ordinary altar was there, to which also they seem to be restrained, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm" title="You shall therefore sacrifice the passover to the LORD your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.">Deu 16:2</a></span>? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> They are not there restrained to one altar, but to one place of worship, as is expressed; and therefore there might be in that place more altars than one, when the multitude of sacrifices so required, which was the case <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-61.htm" title="Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.">1 Kings 8:61</a></span>; and probably at this time, when all the tribes being met, they had many sacrifices to offer, some in common for all, and some peculiar to every tribe.
