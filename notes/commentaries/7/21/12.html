The ban which the assembled tribes had pronounced at Mizpeh seemed to impose on them the necessity of punishing its inhabitants for not joining the crusade against Benjamin; and thus, with a view of repairing the consequences of one rash proceeding, they hurriedly rushed to the perpetration of another, though a smaller tragedy. But it appears (Jud 21:11) that, besides acting in fulfilment of their oath, the Israelites had the additional object by this raid of supplying wives to the Benjamite remnant. This shows the intemperate fury of the Israelites in the indiscriminate slaughter of the women and children.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Young virgins; </span> not married, yet marriageable.

They determined that they would carry out the great oath, which had been uttered when the national assembly was called against such as did not appear, upon that one of the tribes of Israel which had not come to the meeting of the congregation at Mizpeh. The deliberations upon this point were opened (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>) with the question, "Who is he who did not come up to the meeting of all the tribes of Israel, to Jehovah?" In explanation of this question, it is observed at <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>, "For the great oath was uttered upon him that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpeh: he shall be put to death." We learn from this supplementary remark, that when important meetings of the congregation were called, all the members were bound by an oath to appear. The meeting at Mizpeh is the one mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>. The "great oath" consisted in the threat of death in the case of any that were disobedient. To this explanation of the question in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-5.htm">Judges 20:5</a>, the further explanation is added in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-7.htm">Judges 21:7</a>, that the Israelites felt compassion for Benjamin, and wished to avert its entire destruction by procuring wives for such as remained. The word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a> is attached to the explanatory clause in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>, and is to be rendered as a pluperfect: "And the children of Israel had shown themselves compassionate towards their brother Benjamin, and said, A tribe is cut off from Israel to-day; what shall we do to them, to those that remain with regard to wives, as we have sworn?" etc. (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1</a>). The two thoughts, - (1) the oath that those who had not come to Mizpeh should be punished with death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>), and (2) anxiety for the preservation of this tribe which sprang from compassion towards Benjamin, and was shown in their endeavour to provide such as remained with wives, without violating the oath that none of them would give them their own daughters as wives, - formed the two factors which determined the course to be adopted by the congregation. After the statement of these two circumstances, the question of <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>, "Who is the one (only one) of the tribes of Israel which," etc., is resumed and answered: "Behold, there came no one into the camp from Jabesh in Gilead, into the assembly." &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497; is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-8.htm">Judges 21:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>, in a more general sense, as denoting not merely the tribes as such, but the several subdivisions of the tribes.</body></html>
