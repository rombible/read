The problem is, how to prevent Benjamin from becoming extinct; if the survivors are not to die with no descendants to hand on their race and restore the fortunes of the tribe, wives must be found for them; but since the Israelites have sworn not to give them wives, some way out of the difficulty must be devised. With an inconsiderable change in the Hebr., giving the sentence an interrogative force, it is possible to obtain a meaning which suits the context: <span class="ital">How shall a remnant be left over for Benjamin, and a tribe not be blotted out from Israel</span>, (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-18.htm" title="However, we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that gives a wife to Benjamin.">Jdg 21:18</a></span>) <span class="ital">seeing we cannot give them wives of our daughters?</span> The correction is supported by some mss. of the LXX; <span class="ital">a remnant</span> here means a number sufficient to carry on the succession; <span class="ital">we</span>, i.e. the Israelites, is emphatic.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin</span>. The passage is difficult to construe and to explain. If the words <span class="accented">There must be</span> are properly supplied in the A.V., the sense will come out more clearly if we take the word <span class="accented">inheritance</span> to mean rather <span class="accented">succession</span>, which is the idea contained in the root. <span class="accented">There must be a succession for the escaped of Benjamin</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there must be heirs to succeed, and therefore we must find wives for them. <span class="accented">The word peleytah</span> without the article can hardly mean <span class="accented">the remnant</span>, as has been proposed, but must be defined by being taken with <span class="accented">Benjamin.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To punish this unlawful conduct, the congregation sent 12,000 brave fighting men against Jabesh, with orders to smite the inhabitants of the town with the edge of the sword, together with their wives, and children, but also with the more precise instructions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-11.htm">Judges 21:11</a>), "to ban all the men, and women who had known the lying with man" (i.e., to slay them as exposed to death, which implied, on the other hand, that virgins who had not lain with any man should be spared). The fighting men found 400 such virgins in Jabesh, and brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-12.htm">Judges 21:12</a>) refers to the virgins, the masculine being used as the more common genus in the place of the feminine. Shiloh, with the additional clause "in the land of Canaan," which was occasioned by the antithesis Jabesh in Gilead, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-9.htm">Joshua 22:9</a>, was the usual meeting-place of the congregation, on account of its being the seat of the tabernacle. The representatives of the congregation had moved thither, after the deliberations concerning Jabesh, which were still connected with the war against Benjamin, were concluded.</body></html>
