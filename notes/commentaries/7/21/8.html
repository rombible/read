It was six miles from Pella, on the top of a hill which lies on the road from Pella to Gerasa. For some reason with which we are unacquainted, there seems to have been a bond of intense sympathy between the inhabitants of this town and Benjamin. If their abstinence from the assembly of vengeance was not due to this, we must suppose that the sort of companionship in misery caused by these wild events itself created a sense of union between these communities, for it is the peril of Jabesh which first arouses King Saul to action (1 Samuel 11). and in memory of the deliverance which he effected the men of Jabesh alone save the bodies of Saul and Jonathan from the indignity of rotting on the wall of Bethshan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-11.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;">1Samuel 31:11</a>), which gained them the blessing of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/2-5.htm" title="And David sent messengers to the men of Jabeshgilead, and said to them, Blessed be you of the LORD, that you have showed this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.">2Samuel 2:5-6</a>).

The ban which the assembled tribes had pronounced at Mizpeh seemed to impose on them the necessity of punishing its inhabitants for not joining the crusade against Benjamin; and thus, with a view of repairing the consequences of one rash proceeding, they hurriedly rushed to the perpetration of another, though a smaller tragedy. But it appears (Jud 21:11) that, besides acting in fulfilment of their oath, the Israelites had the additional object by this raid of supplying wives to the Benjamite remnant. This shows the intemperate fury of the Israelites in the indiscriminate slaughter of the women and children.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A city in Gilead, and in the tribe of Manasseh; of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm" title="Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.">1 Samuel 11:1</a>,3,9</span>, &c.; <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-11.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;">1 Samuel 31:11</a></span>, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/judges/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they said, what one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord?....

The name survives in the Wâdi el-Jâbis, about half way between the Yarmuk and the W. Zerḳâ (Jabbok); the city probably lay in the upper part of the valley where it reaches the highlands of Gilead, a nights march from Beth-shean (= Bçsân) across the Jordan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm" title="All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.">1 Samuel 31:12</a>. It has been suggested that this narrative of the war against Jabesh was dictated by Judaean animosity against Saul1[64]; but it is clear that the narrative dates from a period later than that of the kingdom of Judah. At the same time we cannot deny that the writer, in singling out Jabesh for punishment, may have remembered its ancient loyalty to Saul (so Moore).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[64] So recently, Kittel, <span class="ital">Gesch. des Volkes Israel</span>2 (1909), p. 23.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/judges/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the termination of the war, the people, i.e., the people who had assembled together for the war (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-9.htm">Judges 21:9</a>), went again to Bethel (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>), to weep there for a day before God at the serious loss which the war had brought upon the congregation. Then they uttered this lamentation: "Why, O Lord God of Israel, is this come to pass in Israel, that a tribe is missing to-day from Israel?" This lamentation involved the wish that God might show them the way to avert the threatened destruction of the missing tribe, and build up the six hundred who remained. To give a practical expression to this wish, they built an altar the next morning, and offered burnt-offerings and supplicatory offerings upon it (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>), knowing as they did that their proposal would not succeed without reconciliation to the Lord, and a return to the fellowship of His grace. There is something apparently strange in the erection of an altar at Bethel, since sacrifices had already been offered there during the war itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>), and this could not have taken place without an altar. Why it was erected again, or another one built, is a question which cannot be answered with any certainty. It is possible, however, that the first was not large enough for the number of sacrifices that had to be offered now.</body></html>
