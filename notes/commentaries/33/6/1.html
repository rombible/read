"Arise thou, Micah." The prophet was not willing to be the herald of woe to his people; but had to arise at the bidding of God, that he might not "be rebellious like that rebellious house" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>. Stand up; as one having all authority to rebuke, and daunted by none. He muses the hearer, as shewing it to be a very grave urgent matter, to be done promptly, urgently, without delay. "Contend thou before (better, as in the English margin with) the mountains." Since man, who had reason, would not use his reason, God calls the mountains and hills, who <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a> unwillingly, as it were, had been the scenes of their idolatry, as if he would say (Lap.), "Insensate though ye be, ye are more sensible than Israel, whom I endowed with sense; for ye feel the voice and command of God your Creator and obey Him; they do not. I cite you, to represent your guilty inhabitants, that, through you, they may hear My complaint to be just, and own themselves guilty, repent, and ask forgiveness." "The altars and idols, the blood of the sacrifices, the bones and ashes upon them, with unuttered yet clear voice, spoke of the idolatry and guilt of the Jews, and so pronounced God's charge and expostulation to be just. Ezekiel is bidden, in like way, to prophesy against "the mountains of Israel <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-2.htm">Ezekiel 6:2-5</a>, "I will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places, and your altars shall be desolate." : "Lifeless nature without voice tells the glory of God; without ears it hears what the Lord speaks." <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-3.htm">Psalm 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Mic 6:1-16.

Here begins a new discourse, and with an address of the prophet to the people of Israel, to hear what the Lord had to say to them by way of reproof for their sins now, as they had heard before many great and precious promises concerning the Messiah, and the happiness of the church in future time; to hear what the Lord now said to them by the prophet, and what he said to the prophet himself, as follows: <p>arise; O Prophet Micah, and do thine office; sit not still, nor indulge to sloth and ease; show readiness, diligence, activity, zeal, and courage in my service, and in carrying a message from me to my people: <p>contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice; open the cause depending between me and my people; state the case between us before the mountains and hills; and exert thyself, and lift up thy voice loudly, and with so much vehemence, that, if it was possible, the very mountains and hills might hear thee; the Lord hereby suggests that they would as soon hear as his people; thus upbraiding their stupidity, as he elsewhere does; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>. Kimchi and Ben Melech render it, to the mountains, which is much to the same sense with our version; call and summon them as witnesses in this cause; let the pleadings be made before them, and let them be judges in this matter; as they might be both for God, and against his people: the mountains and hills clothed with grass, and covered with flocks and herds; or set with all manner of fruit trees, vines, olives, and figs; or adorned with goodly cedars, oaks, and elms; were witnesses of the goodness of God unto them, and the same could testify against them; and, had they mouths to speak, could declare the abominations committed on them; how upon every high mountain and hill, and under every green tree, they had been guilty of idolatry. The Targum, and many versions (q), render it, "with the mountains"; and the Vulgate Latin version, and others, "against the mountains" (r); the inhabitants of Judea, that being a mountainous country, especially some parts of it. Some by "mountains" understand the great men of the land, king, princes, nobles; and, by "hills", lesser magistrates, with whom the Lord's controversy chiefly was; they not discharging their offices aright, nor setting good examples to the people. Some copies of the Targum, as the king of Spain's Bible, paraphrase it, <p>"judge or contend with the fathers, and let the mothers hear thy voice;'' <p>which Kimchi thus explains, as if it was said, let the fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the mothers Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah, hear what their children hath rendered to the Lord; let them be, as it were, called out of their graves to hear the ill requital made to the Lord for all his goodness. <p>(q)  "cum istis montiibus", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Tarnovius; "cum montibus", Montanus, Munster, Cocceius, Burkius.

"And the Lord Jehovah of hosts, who toucheth the earth, and it melteth, and all the inhabitants of thereupon mourn; and the whole of it riseth like the Nile, and sinketh like the Nile of Egypt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>. Who buildeth His stories in heaven, and His vault, over the earth hath He founded it; who calleth to the waters of the sea, and poureth them out over the earth: Jehovah is His name." This description of God, who rules with omnipotence, is appended, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>, without any link of connection whatever. We must not render it, "The Lord Jehovah of hosts is He who toucheth the earth;" but we must supply the connecting thought, "And He who thus directeth His eye upon you is the Lord Jehovah of hosts, who toucheth the earth, and it melteth." The melting or dissolving of the earth is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>, an effect produced by the Lord, who makes His voice heard in judgments, or "the destructive effect of the judgments of God, whose instruments the conquerors are" (Hengstenberg), when nations reel and kingdoms totter. The Lord therefore touches the earth, so that it melts, when He dissolves the stability of the earth by great judgments (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a>). "Israel could not fail to test the truth of these words by painful experience, when the wild hordes of Assyria poured themselves over the western parts of Asia" (Hengstenberg). The following words, depicting the dissolution of the earth, are repeated, with very inconsiderable alterations, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-8.htm">Amos 8:8</a>; we have merely the omission of &#1493;&#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, and the kal &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492; substituted for the niphal &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a> there is evidently an allusion to the flood. God, who is enthroned in heaven, in the cloud-towers built above the circle of the earth, possesses the power to pour the waves of the sea over the earth by His simple word. Ma&#8219;a&#774;lo&#772;th is synonymous with &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> : upper rooms, lit., places to which one has to ascend. 'Agudda&#770;h, an arch or vault: that which is called ra&#770;q&#305;&#772;a&#774;&#8219;, the firmament, in other places. The heaven, in which God builds His stories, is the heaven of clouds; and the vault, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7</a>, is the firmament of heaven, which divided the water above the firmament from the water beneath it. Consequently the upper rooms of God are the waters above the firmament, in or out of which God builds His stories (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>), i.e., the cloud-tower above the horizon of the earth, which is raised above it like a vault. Out of this cloud-castle the rain pours down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>); and out of its open windows the waters of the flood poured down, and overflowed the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>). When God calls to the waters of the sea, they pour themselves over the surface of the earth. The waves of the sea are a figurative representation of the agitated multitude of nations, or of the powers of the world, which pour their waves over the kingdom of God (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>). </body></html>
