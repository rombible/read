Sin causes the controversy between God and man. God reasons with us, to teach us to reason with ourselves. Let them remember God's many favours to them and their fathers, and compare with them their unworthy, ungrateful conduct toward him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear, ye strong (or, it may be, ye enduring,) foundations of the earth - Mountains and rocks carry the soul to times far away, before and after. They change net, like the habitable, cultivated, surface of the earth. There they were, before the existence of our short-lived generations; there they will be, until time shall cease to be. They have witnessed so many vicissitudes of human things, themselves unchanging. The prophet is directed to seize this feeling of simple nature. "They have seen so much before me," Yes! "then they have seen all which befell my forefathers; all God's benefits, all along, to them and to us, all their and our unthankfulness."<p>He will plead with Israel - God hath a strict severe judgment with His people, and yet vouchsafes to clear Himself before His creatures, to come down from His throne of glory and place Himself on equal terms with them. He does not plead only, but mutually (such is the force of the word) impleads with His people, hears if they would say aught against Himself, and then gives His own judgment . But this willingness to hear, only makes us condemn ourselves, so that we should be without excuse before Him. We do owe ourselves wholly to Him who made us and hath given us all things richly to enjoy.<p>If we have withdrawn ourselves from His Service, unless He dealt hardly with us, we dealt rebelliously and ungratefully with Him. God brings all pleas into a narrow space. The fault is with Him or with us. He offers to clear Himself. He sets before us His good deeds, His Loving kindness, Providence, Grace, Long-suffering, Bounty, Truth, and contrasts with them our evil deeds, our unthankfulness, despitefulness, our breach of His laws, and disorderings of His creation. And then, in the face of His Goodness, He asks, "What evil have I done, what good have I left undone?" so that our evil and negligences should be but a requital of His. For if it is evil to return evil for evil, or not to return good for good, what evil is it to return evil for His exceeding good! As He says by Isaiah, "What could have been done more to My vineyard and I have not done in it. Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>.<p>And our Blessed Lord asks; "Many good works have I shewed you from My Father. For which of those works do ye stone Me?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm">John 10:32</a>. "Which of you convinceth Me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe Me?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-46.htm">John 8:46</a>. Away from the light of God, we may plead excuses, and cast the blame of our sins upon our temptations, or passions, or nature, that is, on Almighty God Himself, who made us. When His light streams in upon our conscience, we are silent. Blessed if we be silenced and confess to Him then, that we be not first silenced in the Day of Judgment <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-20.htm">Ezekiel 14:20</a>.

These are the words of the prophet, obeying the divine command, calling upon the mountains, which are the strong parts of the earth, and the bottoms of them the foundations of it, to hear the Lord's controversy with his people, and judge between them; or, as some think, these are the persons with whom, and against whom, the controversy was; the chief and principal men of the land, who were as pillars to the common people to support and uphold them: <p>for the Lord hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel; his people Israel, who were so by choice, by covenant, by their own avouchment and profession: they had been guilty of many sins and transgressions against both tables of the law; and now the Lord had a controversy with them for them, and was determined to enter into judgment, and litigate the point with them; and dreadful it is when God brings in a charge, and pleads his own cause with sinful men; they are not able to contend with him, nor answer him for one of a thousand faults committed against him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/micah/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/micah/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">ye strong foundations</span>] ‘Strong’ should rather be <span class="bld">enduring</span>.

So in the following verses. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To strengthen this threat, Amos proceeds, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-5.htm">Amos 9:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>, to describe Jehovah as the Lord of heaven and earth, who sends judgments upon the earth with omnipotent power. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-5.htm">Amos 9:5</a>. "And the Lord Jehovah of hosts, who toucheth the earth, and it melteth, and all the inhabitants of thereupon mourn; and the whole of it riseth like the Nile, and sinketh like the Nile of Egypt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>. Who buildeth His stories in heaven, and His vault, over the earth hath He founded it; who calleth to the waters of the sea, and poureth them out over the earth: Jehovah is His name." This description of God, who rules with omnipotence, is appended, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>, without any link of connection whatever. We must not render it, "The Lord Jehovah of hosts is He who toucheth the earth;" but we must supply the connecting thought, "And He who thus directeth His eye upon you is the Lord Jehovah of hosts, who toucheth the earth, and it melteth." The melting or dissolving of the earth is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>, an effect produced by the Lord, who makes His voice heard in judgments, or "the destructive effect of the judgments of God, whose instruments the conquerors are" (Hengstenberg), when nations reel and kingdoms totter. The Lord therefore touches the earth, so that it melts, when He dissolves the stability of the earth by great judgments (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4</a>). "Israel could not fail to test the truth of these words by painful experience, when the wild hordes of Assyria poured themselves over the western parts of Asia" (Hengstenberg). The following words, depicting the dissolution of the earth, are repeated, with very inconsiderable alterations, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-8.htm">Amos 8:8</a>; we have merely the omission of &#1493;&#1504;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, and the kal &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492; substituted for the niphal &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492;. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a> there is evidently an allusion to the flood. God, who is enthroned in heaven, in the cloud-towers built above the circle of the earth, possesses the power to pour the waves of the sea over the earth by His simple word. Ma&#8219;a&#774;lo&#772;th is synonymous with &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> : upper rooms, lit., places to which one has to ascend. 'Agudda&#770;h, an arch or vault: that which is called ra&#770;q&#305;&#772;a&#774;&#8219;, the firmament, in other places. The heaven, in which God builds His stories, is the heaven of clouds; and the vault, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7</a>, is the firmament of heaven, which divided the water above the firmament from the water beneath it. Consequently the upper rooms of God are the waters above the firmament, in or out of which God builds His stories (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>), i.e., the cloud-tower above the horizon of the earth, which is raised above it like a vault. Out of this cloud-castle the rain pours down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>); and out of its open windows the waters of the flood poured down, and overflowed the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>). When God calls to the waters of the sea, they pour themselves over the surface of the earth. The waves of the sea are a figurative representation of the agitated multitude of nations, or of the powers of the world, which pour their waves over the kingdom of God (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-4.htm">Amos 7:4</a>). </body></html>
