They reproduced the sins of the northern kingdom, and their conduct was aggravated by the advantages vouchsafed to them. The greatness of their reproach should therefore be in proportion to the greatness of the glory which properly belonged to them as the people of God.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/micah/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm" title="For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and you walk in their counsels; that I should make you a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore you shall bear the reproach of my people.">Micah 6:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">For the statutes of Omri are kept — </span>An idolatrous king, of whom it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-25.htm" title="But Omri worked evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.">1 Kings 16:25</a>, that he <span class="ital">did worse than all that were before him, </span>and therefore we may judge of the corruption of the people who imitated the example, and followed the institutions of such a one.

This voice of the Lord says to all, Hear the rod when it is coming, before you see it, and feel it. Hear the rod when it is come, and you are sensible of the smart; hear what counsels, what cautions it speaks. The voice of God is to be heard in the rod of God. Those who are dishonest in their dealings shall never be reckoned pure, whatever shows of devotion they may make. What is got by fraud and oppression, cannot be kept or enjoyed with satisfaction. What we hold closest we commonly lose soonest. Sin is a root of bitterness, soon planted, but not soon plucked up again. Their being the people of God in name and profession, while they kept themselves in his love, was an honour to them; but now, being backsliders, their having been once the people of God turns to their reproach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the statutes of Omri are kept - Rather, (like the English margin he doth much keep,) And he doth keep diligently for himself. Both ways express much diligence in evil . To "keep God's commandments" was the familiar phrase, in which Israel was exhorted, by every motive of hope and fear, to obedience to God. "I know him," God says of Abraham, "that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do judgment and justice" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>. This was the fundamental commandment immediately after the deliverance from Eyypt upon their first murmuring. "The Lord made there" (at Marah) "for them a statute and ordinance, and said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight, and wilt give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians" <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25-26</a>.<p>In this character Ha revealed Himself on Mount Sinai, as "shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>. This was their covenant, "Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God and to walk in His ways, and to keep His statutes and His commandments and His judgments and to hearken unto His voice" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17</a>.

Under this term all the curses of the law were threatened, if they "hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord their God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded them" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>.<p>Under this again the future of good and evil was, in Solomon, set before the house of David; of unbroken succession on his throne, if "thou wilt keep My commandments; but contrariwise, if ye or your children will not keep My commandments and My statutes" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4-6</a>, banishment, destruction of the temple, and themselves to be "a proverb and a byword among all people" This was the object of their existence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-7.htm">1 Kings 9:7</a>. "that they might keep His statutes and observe His laws" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-45.htm">Psalm 105:45</a>. This was the summary of their disobedience, "they kept not the covenant of God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a>. And now was come the contrary to all this. They had not kept the commandments of God; and those commandments of man which were the most contrary to the commandments of God, they had kept and did keep diligently. Alas! that the Christian world should be so like them! What iron habit or custom of man, what fashion, is not kept, if it is against the law of God? How few are not more afraid of man than God? Had God's command run, Speak evil one of another, brethren, would it not have been the best kept of all His commandments? God says, speak not evil; custom, the conversation around, fear of man, say, speak evil; man's commandment is kept; God's is not kept. And no one repents or makes restitution; few even cease from the sin.<p>Scripture does not record, what was the special aggravation of the sin of Omri, since the accursed worship of Baal was brought in by Ahab , his son. But, as usual, "like father, like son." The son developed the sins of the father. Some special sinfulness of Omri is implied, in that Athaliah, the murderess of her children, is called after her grandfather, Omri, not after her father, Ahab <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>. Heresiarchs have a deeper guilt than their followers, although the heresy itself is commonly developed later. Omri settled for a while the kingdom of Israel, after the anarchy which followed on the murder of Elah, and slew Zimri, his murderer.<p>Yet before God, he did worse than all before him, and be walked in all the way of Jeroboam <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-25.htm">1 Kings 16:25-26</a>. Yet this too did not suffice Judah; for it follows, And all the doings of the house of Ahab, who again "did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him and served Baal" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/30.htm">1 Kings 30-33</a>; Ahab, to whom none "was like in sin, who did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>. These were they, whose statutes Judah now kept, as diligently and accurately as if it had been a religious act. They kept, not the statutes of the Lord, "but the statutes of Omri;" they kept, as their pattern before their eyes, all the doings of the house of Ahab, his luxury, oppression, the bloodshedding of Naboth; and they walked onward, not, as God bade them, humbly with Him, but in their counsels. And what must be the end of all this? that I should make thee a desolation. They acted, as though the very end and object of all their acts were that, wherein they ended, their own destruction and reproach .<p>Therefore ye shall bear the reproach of My people - The title of the people of God must be a glory or a reproach. Judah had gloried in being God's people, outwardly, by His covenant and protection; they Were envied for the outward distinction. They refused to be so inwardly, and gave themselves to the hideous, desecrating, worship of Baal. Now then what had been their pride, should be the aggravation of their punishment. Now too we hear of people everywhere zealous for a system, which their deeds belie. Faith, without love, (such as their character had been,) feels any insult to the relation to God, which by its deeds it disgraces. Though they had themselves neglected God, yet it was a heavy burden to them to bear the triumph of the pagan over them, that God was unable to help them, or had cast them off "These are the people of the Lord and are gone forth, out of His land" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. "Wherefore should they say among the pagan, where is their God?" (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>). "We are confounded, because we have heard reproach, shame hath covered our faces, for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the Lord's house" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-51.htm">Jeremiah 51:51</a>. "We are become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-4.htm">Psalm 79:4</a>. "Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. Thou makest us a byword among the pagan, a shaking of the head among the people. My confusion is daily before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, for the voice of him that slandereth and blasphemeth, by reason of the enemy and the avenger" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-13.htm">Psalm 44:13-16</a>.<p>The words, "the reproach of My people," may also include  "the reproach wherewith God in the law <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a> threatened His people if they should forsake Him," which indeed comes to the same thing, the one being the prophecy, the other the fulfillment. The word hissing in itself recalled the threat to David's house in Solomon; "At this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and hiss" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>. Micah's phrase became a favorite expression of Jeremiah . So only do God's prophets denounce. It is a marvelous glimpse into man's religious history, that faith, although it had been inoperative and was trampled upon without, should still survive; nay, that God, whom in prosperity they had forsaken and forgotten, should be remembered, when He seemed to forget and to forsake them. Had the captive Jews abandoned their faith, the reproach would have ceased. The words, "ye shall bear the reproach" of My people are," at once, a prediction of their deserved suffering for the profanation of God's Name by their misdeeds, and of their persverance in that faith which, up to that Time, they had mostly neglected. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. statutes of Omri&#8212;the founder of Samaria and of Ahab's wicked house; and a supporter of Jeroboam's superstitions (1Ki 16:16-28).

"If thieves had come to thee, if robbers by night, alas, how art thou destroyed! would they not steal their sufficiency? If vine-dressers had come to thee, would they not leave gleanings? <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a>. How have the things of Esau been explored, his hidden treasures desired! <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-7.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a>. Even to the border have all the men of thy covenant sent thee: the men of thy peace have deceived thee, overpowered thee. They make thy bread a wound under thee. There is no understanding in him." In order to exhibit the more vividly the complete clearing out of Edom, Obadiah supposes two cases of plundering in which there is still something left (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>), and then shows that the enemies in Edom will act much worse than this. &#1488;&#1501; with the perfect supposes a case to have already occurred, when, although it does not as yet exist in reality, it does so in imagination. &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; are common thieves, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; robbers by night, who carry off another's property by force. With this second expression, the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1498; must be repeated. "To thee," i.e., to do thee harm; it is actually equivalent to "upon thee." The following words &#1488;&#1497;&#1498;  &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; cannot form the apodosis to the two previous clauses, because nidme&#772;tha&#770;h is too strong a term for the injury inflicted by thieves or robbers, but chiefly because the following expression &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1497;&#1490;&#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is irreconcilable with such an explanation, the thought that thieves steal &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; being quite opposed to nidma&#770;h, or being destroyed. The clause "how art thou destroyed" must rather be taken as pointing far beyond the contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a>. It is more fully explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-9.htm">Obadiah 1:9</a>, and is thereby proved to be a thought thrown in parenthetically, with which the prophet anticipates the principal fact in his lively description, in the form of an exclamation of amazement. The apodosis to 'im ganna&#770;gh&#305;&#772;m (if robbers, etc.) follows in the words "do they not steal" ( equals  they surely steal) dayya&#770;m, i.e., their sufficiency (see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-16.htm">Isaiah 40:16</a>); that is to say, as much as they need, or can use, or find lying open before them. The picture of the grape-gatherers says the same thing. They also do not take away all, even to the very last, but leave some gleanings behind, not only if they fear God, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-21.htm">Deuteronomy 24:21</a>, as Hitzig supposes, but even if they do not trouble themselves about God's commandments at all, because many a bunch escapes their notice which is only discovered on careful gleaning. Edom, on the contrary, is completely cleared out. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a> the address to Edom passes over into words concerning him. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493; is construed as a collective with the plural. &#1488;&#1497;&#1498; is a question of amazement. Cha&#770;phas, to search through, to explore (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12-13</a>).

Matspo&#772;n, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. from tsa&#770;phan, does not mean a secret place, but a hidden thing or treasure (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, lxx). Obadiah mentions the plundering first, because Petra, the capital of Edom, was a great emporium of the Syrio-Arabian trade, where many valuables were stored (vid., Diod. Sic. xix. 95), and because with the loss of these riches the prosperity and power of Edom were destroyed.<p>(Note: Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>) has greatly altered the words of Obadiah, dropping the comparison of the enemy to thieves and grape-gatherers, and representing the enemy as being themselves grape-gatherers who leave no gleaning, and thieves who waste till they have enough; and thereby considerably weakening the poetical picture.) </body></html>
