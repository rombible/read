Oil was regarded as indispensable for personal comfort. In Jotham’s parable of the trees in council about the choice of a king, the olive-tree was regarded first in estimation, before even the vine and fig-tree.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/micah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:9-16 God, having showed how necessary it was that they should do justly, here shows how plain it was that they had done unjustly. This voice of the Lord says to all, Hear the rod when it is coming, before you see it, and feel it. Hear the rod when it is come, and you are sensible of the smart; hear what counsels, what cautions it speaks. The voice of God is to be heard in the rod of God. Those who are dishonest in their dealings shall never be reckoned pure, whatever shows of devotion they may make. What is got by fraud and oppression, cannot be kept or enjoyed with satisfaction. What we hold closest we commonly lose soonest. Sin is a root of bitterness, soon planted, but not soon plucked up again. Their being the people of God in name and profession, while they kept themselves in his love, was an honour to them; but now, being backsliders, their having been once the people of God turns to their reproach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap - Micah renews the threatenings of the law <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38-41</a>, which they had been habitually breaking. Those prophecies had been fulfilled before, throughout their history; they have been fulfilled lately in Israel for the like oppression of the poor <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>. Their frequent fulfillment spoke as much of a law of God's righteousness, punishing sin, as the yearly supply in the ordinary course of nature spoke of His loving Providence. It is the bitterest punishment to the covetous to have the things which they coveted, taken away before their eyes; it was a token of God's Hand, that He took them away, when just within their grasp. The prophet brings it before their eyes, that they might feel beforehand the bitterness of forgetting them. Montanus: "They should lose, not only what they gained unjustly, but the produce of their labor, care, industry, as, in agriculture, it is said that there is mostly much labor, little fraud, much benefit."<p>Harvest is a proverb for joy; "they joy before Thee according to the joy in, harvest" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>; "wine maketh glad the heart of man, and oil is to make him a cheerful countenance" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>. But the harvest shall be turned into sorrow, the oil and wine shall be taken away, when all the labor had been employed (Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-17.htm">Jeremiah 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>). Yet, since all these operations in nature are adapted to be, and are used as, symbols of things spiritual, then the words which describe them are adapted to be spiritual proverbs. Spiritually, , "he soweth and reapeth not, who soweth to the flesh, and of the flesh reapeth corruption" <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm">Galatians 6:8</a>, things corruptible, and inward decay and condemnation. He treadeth the olive, who, by shameful deeds contrary to the law, "grieveth the Holy Spirit of God" <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>, and therefore obtaineth not gladness of spirit; "he maketh wine, yet drinketh not wine, who teacheth others, not himself." They too take hold but do not deliver, who for awhile believe and in time of temptation fall away, who repent for a while and then fall back into old sins, or in other ways bring no fruit to perfection; taking up the Cross for awhile and then wearying; using religious practices, as, more frequent prayer or fasting, and then tiring; cultivating some graces and then despairing because they see not the fruits. These tread the olive, but are not anointed with the oil of the Holy Spirit of grace, who (Rib.), "end by doing for the sake of man, what they had thought to do out of the love for God, and abandon, for some fear of man, the good which they had begun." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/micah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. sow &#8230; not reap&#8212;fulfilling the threat (Le 26:16; De 28:38-40; Am 5:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/micah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou shalt sow, </span> be at great pains and cost in tilling and sowing, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">but thou shalt not reap; </span> it shall either not thrive to a harvest, or, if it does, an enemy shall reap it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou shalt tread the olives, </span> lay out thy labour and weary thyself in it, plant the tree, gather the fruit and tread it, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; </span> when thus prepared to use it, an enemy shall rob thee of it.

Ancient oil-presses are still found in Palestine. The olives were ground to a pulp sometimes by treading, sometimes by a stone-wheel.
