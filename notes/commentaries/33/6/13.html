This voice of the Lord says to all, Hear the rod when it is coming, before you see it, and feel it. Hear the rod when it is come, and you are sensible of the smart; hear what counsels, what cautions it speaks. The voice of God is to be heard in the rod of God. Those who are dishonest in their dealings shall never be reckoned pure, whatever shows of devotion they may make. What is got by fraud and oppression, cannot be kept or enjoyed with satisfaction. What we hold closest we commonly lose soonest. Sin is a root of bitterness, soon planted, but not soon plucked up again. Their being the people of God in name and profession, while they kept themselves in his love, was an honour to them; but now, being backsliders, their having been once the people of God turns to their reproach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/micah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore also will I-- (Literally, And I too,) that is, this dost thou, and thus will I too do.

If thou buildest high like the eagle, and if thy nest were placed among stars, thence will I cast thee down, is the saying of Jehovah." <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-2.htm">Obadiah 1:2</a> is correctly attached in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>) by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, inasmuch as it contains the reason for the attack upon Edom. By hinne&#772;h (behold), which points to the fact itself, the humiliation of Edom is vividly presented to the mind. The perfect na&#770;thatt&#305;&#772; "describes the resolution of Jehovah as one whose fulfilment is as certain as if it had already occurred" (Caspari). What Jehovah says really takes place. &#1511;&#1496;&#1503; refers to the number of the people. The participle &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; is perfectly appropriate, as expressing the ideal present, i.e., the present which follows the &#1511;&#1496;&#1503; &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;. When the Lord has made Edom small, it will be very much despised. It is only through an incorrect interpretation of the historical present that Hitzig would possibly be led to regard the participle as unsuitable, and to give the preference to Jeremiah's &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;.</body></html>
